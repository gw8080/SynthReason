SynthReason setup is in four stages.
Stage one: Strip a common words list using a Wikipedia article or something small, acquire necessary connectives and preposition filtering file.
Stage Two: Use common words list to create the word matrix using the Turing algorithm.
Stage Three: Use the output of the Turing algorithm for the probability distribution algorithm.
Stage four. Transfer all files(Turing file & probability distribution) to SynthReason and run the algorithm against a large bigram detection file.
