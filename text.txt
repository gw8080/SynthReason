Philosophy from Greek: φιλοσοφία philosophia love of wisdom is the study of general and fundamental questions about existence knowledge values reason mind and language. Such questions are often posed as problems to be studied or resolved. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras c.  –  BCE. Philosophical methods include questioning critical discussion rational argument and systematic presentation.iClassic philosophical questions include: is it possible to know anything and to prove it and what is most real Philosophers also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: is there a best way to live is it better to be just or unjust if one can get away with it do humans have free willHistorically philosophy encompassed all bodies of knowledge. From the time of Ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle to the th century natural philosophy encompassed astronomy medicine and physics. For example Newtons  Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy later became classified as a book of physics.In the th century the growth of modern research universities led academic philosophy and other disciplines to professionalize and specialize. In the modern era some investigations that were traditionally part of philosophy became separate academic disciplines including psychology sociology linguistics and economics. Other investigations closely related to art science politics or other pursuits remained part of philosophy. For example is beauty objective or subjective Are there many scientific methods or just one Is political utopia a hopeful dream or hopeless fantasyMajor sub-fields of academic philosophy include: metaphysics which is concerned with the fundamental nature of reality and being; and epistemology which is about nature and grounds of knowledge and…its limits and validity; as well as ethics aesthetics political philosophy logic and philosophy of science.Initially the term philosophy referred to any body of knowledge. In this sense philosophy is closely related to religion mathematics natural science education and politics. Though as of the s it has been classified as a book of physics Newtons Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy  uses the term natural philosophy as it was understood at the time to encompass disciplines such as astronomy medicine and physics that later became associated with sciences.In the first part of his Academica  Cicero introduced the division of philosophy into logic physics and ethics emulating Epicurus division of his doctrine into canon physics and ethics.In section thirteen of his Lives and Opinions of the Eminent Philosophers  Diogenes Laërtius rd century the first historian of philosophy established the traditional division of philosophical inquiry into three parts:Natural philosophy i.e. physics from Greek: ta physika lit. things having to do with physis nature was the study of the constitution and processes of transformation in the physical world;Moral philosophy i.e. ethics from êthika having to do with character disposition manners was the study of goodness right and wrong justice and virtue; andMetaphysical philosophy i.e. logic from logikós of or pertaining to reason or speech was the study of existence causation God logic forms and other abstract objects meta ta physika after the Physics.This division is not obsolete but has changed: natural philosophy has split into the various natural sciences especially physics astronomy chemistry biology and cosmology; moral philosophy has birthed the social sciences while still including value theory e.g. ethics aesthetics political philosophy etc.; and metaphysical philosophy has given way to formal sciences such as logic mathematics and philosophy of science while still including epistemology cosmology etc.Many philosophical debates that began in ancient times are still debated today. McGinn  and others claim that no philosophical progress has occurred during that interval. Chalmers  and others by contrast see progress in philosophy similar to that in science while Brewer  argued that progress is the wrong standard by which to judge philosophical activity.In one general sense philosophy is associated with wisdom intellectual culture and a search for knowledge. In this sense all cultures and literate societies ask philosophical questions such as how are we to live and what is the nature of reality. A broad and impartial conception of philosophy then finds a reasoned inquiry into such matters as reality morality and life in all world civilizations.Statue of Aristotle in the Aristotlepark of StagiraWestern philosophy is the philosophical tradition of the Western world dating back to pre-Socratic thinkers who were active in th-century Greece BCE such as Thales c.  –  BCE and Pythagoras c.  –  BCE who practiced a love of wisdom Latin: philosophia and were also termed students of nature physiologoi.Western philosophy can be divided into three eras:While our knowledge of the ancient era begins with Thales in the th century BCE comparatively little is known about the philosophers who came before Socrates commonly known as the pre-Socratics. The ancient era was dominated by Greek philosophical schools which were significantly influenced by Socrates teachings. Most notable among these were Plato who founded the Platonic Academy and his student Aristotle who founded the Peripatetic school. Other ancient philosophical traditions included Cynicism Stoicism Skepticism and Epicureanism. Important topics covered by the Greeks included metaphysics with competing theories such as atomism and monism cosmology the nature of the well-lived life eudaimonia the possibility of knowledge and the nature of reason logos. With the rise of the Roman empire Greek philosophy was also increasingly discussed in Latin by Romans such as Cicero and Seneca see Roman philosophy.Medieval philosophy th–th centuries is the period following the fall of the Western Roman Empire and was dominated by the rise of Christianity and hence reflects Judeo-Christian theological concerns as well as retaining a continuity with Greco-Roman thought. Problems such as the existence and nature of God the nature of faith and reason metaphysics the problem of evil were discussed in this period. Some key Medieval thinkers include St. Augustine Thomas Aquinas Boethius Anselm and Roger Bacon. Philosophy for these thinkers was viewed as an aid to Theology ancilla theologiae and hence they sought to align their philosophy with their interpretation of sacred scripture. This period saw the development of Scholasticism a text critical method developed in medieval universities based on close reading and disputation on key texts. The Renaissance period saw increasing focus on classic Greco-Roman thought and on a robust Humanism.Early modern philosophy in the Western world begins with thinkers such as Thomas Hobbes and René Descartes –. Following the rise of natural science modern philosophy was concerned with developing a secular and rational foundation for knowledge and moved away from traditional structures of authority such as religion scholastic thought and the Church. Major modern philosophers include Spinoza Leibniz Locke Berkeley Hume and Kant.iiiiiivth-century philosophy sometimes called late modern philosophy was influenced by the wider th-century movement termed the Enlightenment and includes figures such as Hegel a key figure in German idealism Kierkegaard who developed the foundations for existentialism Nietzsche a famed anti-Christian John Stuart Mill who promoted utilitarianism Karl Marx who developed the foundations for communism and the American William James. The th century saw the split between analytic philosophy and continental philosophy as well as philosophical trends such as phenomenology existentialism logical positivism pragmatism and the linguistic turn see Contemporary philosophy.An Iranian portrait of Avicenna on a Silver Vase. He was one of the most influential philosophers of the Islamic Golden Age.See also: Islamic philosophy and Middle Eastern philosophyThe regions of the fertile Crescent Iran and Arabia are home to the earliest known philosophical Wisdom literature and is today mostly dominated by Islamic culture. Early wisdom literature from the fertile crescent was a genre which sought to instruct people on ethical action practical living and virtue through stories and proverbs. In Ancient Egypt these texts were known as sebayt teachings and they are central to our understandings of Ancient Egyptian philosophy. Babylonian astronomy also included much philosophical speculations about cosmology which may have influenced the Ancient Greeks. Jewish philosophy and Christian philosophy are religio-philosophical traditions that developed both in the Middle East and in Europe which both share certain early Judaic texts mainly the Tanakh and monotheistic beliefs. Jewish thinkers such as the Geonim of the Talmudic Academies in Babylonia and Maimonides engaged with Greek and Islamic philosophy. Later Jewish philosophy came under strong Western intellectual influences and includes the works of Moses Mendelssohn who ushered in the Haskalah the Jewish Enlightenment Jewish existentialism and Reform Judaism.Pre-Islamic Iranian philosophy begins with the work of Zoroaster one of the first promoters of monotheism and of the dualism between good and evil. This dualistic cosmogony influenced later Iranian developments such as Manichaeism Mazdakism and Zurvanism.After the Muslim conquests Early Islamic philosophy developed the Greek philosophical traditions in new innovative directions. This Islamic Golden Age influenced European intellectual developments. The two main currents of early Islamic thought are Kalam which focuses on Islamic theology and Falsafa which was based on Aristotelianism and Neoplatonism. The work of Aristotle was very influential among the falsafa such as al-Kindi th century Avicenna  – June  and Averroes th century. Others such as Al-Ghazali were highly critical of the methods of the Aristotelian falsafa. Islamic thinkers also developed a scientific method experimental medicine a theory of optics and a legal philosophy. Ibn Khaldun was an influential thinker in philosophy of history.In Iran several schools of Islamic philosophy continued to flourish after the Golden Age and include currents such as Illuminationist philosophy Sufi philosophy and Transcendent theosophy. The th- and th-century Arab world saw the Nahda awakening; aka the Arab Renaissance movement which influenced contemporary Islamic philosophy.Indian philosophy Sanskrit: darśana lit. point of view perspective refers to the diverse philosophical traditions that emerged since the ancient times on the Indian subcontinent. Jainism and Buddhism originated at the end of the Vedic period while Hinduism emerged after the period as a fusion of diverse traditions.Hindus generally classify these traditions as either orthodox āstika or heterodox nāstika depending on whether they accept the authority of the Vedas and the theories of brahman eternal conscious irreducible and ātman soul self breathe therein. The orthodox schools include the Hindu traditions of thought while the heterodox schools include the Buddhist and the Jain traditions.v Other schools include the Ajñana Ājīvika and Cārvāka which became extinct over their history.Important Indian philosophical concepts shared by the Indian philosophies and virtues include:Akalanka an th century Jain monk and philosopher who wrote influential works on Indian LogicMain article: Jain philosophyJain philosophy accepts the concept of a permanent soul jiva as one of the five astikayas eternal infinite categories that make up the substance of existence. The other four being dhárma adharma ākāśa space and pudgala matter.The Jain thought separates matter from the soul completely with two major subtraditions: Digambara sky dressed naked and Śvētāmbara white dressed along with several more minor traditions such as Terapanthi.Asceticism is a major monastic virtue in Jainism. Jain texts such as the Tattvartha Sutra state that right faith right knowledge and right conduct is the path to liberation. The Jain thought holds that all existence is cyclic eternal and uncreated. The Tattvartha Sutra is the earliest known most comprehensive and authoritative compilation of Jain philosophy.Monks debating at Sera monastery Tibet . According to Jan Westerhoff public debates constituted the most important and most visible forms of philosophical exchange in ancient Indian intellectual life.Buddhist philosophy begins with the thought of Gautama Buddha fl. between th and th century BCE and is preserved in the early Buddhist texts. It originated in India and later spread to East Asia Tibet Central Asia and Southeast Asia developing various traditions in these regions. Mahayana forms are the dominant Buddhist philosophical traditions in East Asian regions such as China Korea and Japan. The Theravada forms are dominant in Southeast Asian countries such as Sri Lanka Burma and Thailand.Because ignorance to the true nature of things is considered one of the roots of suffering dukkha Buddhist philosophy is concerned with epistemology metaphysics ethics and psychology. Buddhist philosophical texts must also be understood within the context of meditative practices which are supposed to bring about certain cognitive shifts.: Key innovative concepts include the four noble truths as an analysis of dukkha anicca impermanence and anatta non-self.viAfter the death of the Buddha various groups began to systematize his main teachings eventually developing comprehensive philosophical systems termed Abhidharma.: Following the Abhidharma schools Mahayana philosophers such as Nagarjuna and Vasubandhu developed the theories of śūnyatā emptiness of all phenomena and vijñapti-matra appearance only a form of phenomenology or transcendental idealism. The Dignāga school of pramāṇa means of knowledge promoted a sophisticated form of Buddhist logico-epistemology.There were numerous schools sub-schools and traditions of Buddhist philosophy in India. According to Oxford professor of Buddhist philosophy Jan Westerhoff the major Indian schools from  BCE to  CE were::xxivAfter the disappearance of Buddhism from India some of these philosophical traditions continued to develop in the Tibetan Buddhist East Asian Buddhist and Theravada Buddhist traditions.citation neededAdi Shankara is one of the much studied Hindu philosophers.Main article: Hindu philosophyThe Vedas-based orthodox schools are a part of the Hindu traditions and they are traditionally classified into six darśanas: Nyaya Vaisheshika Samkhya Yoga Mīmāṃsā and Vedanta.vii The Vedas as a knowledge source were interpreted differently by these six schools of Hindu philosophy with varying degrees of overlap. They represent a collection of philosophical views that share a textual connection according to Chadha . They also reflect a tolerance for a diversity of philosophical interpretations within Hinduism while sharing the same foundation.viiiSome of the earliest surviving Hindu mystical and philosophical texts are the Upanishads of the later Vedic period – BCE. Hindu philosophers of the six schools developed systems of epistemology pramana and investigated topics such as metaphysics ethics psychology guṇa hermeneutics and soteriology within the framework of the Vedic knowledge while presenting a diverse collection of interpretations. These schools of philosophy accepted the Vedas and the Vedic concept of Ātman and Brahmanvii differed from the following Indian religions that rejected the authority of the Vedas:Cārvāka a materialism school that accepted the existence of free will.Ājīvika a materialism school that denied the existence of free will.Buddhism a philosophy that denies the existence of ātman unchanging soul Selfixx and is based on the teachings and enlightenment of Gautama Buddha.xiJainism a philosophy that accepts the existence of the ātman but is based on the teachings of twenty-four ascetic teachers known as tirthankaras with Rishabha as the first and Mahavira as the twenty-fourth.The commonly named six orthodox schools over time led to what has been called the Hindu synthesis as exemplified by its scripture the Bhagavad Gita.Kitarō Nishida professor of philosophy at Kyoto University and founder of the Kyoto School.Main articles: Chinese philosophy Korean philosophy Japanese philosophy Vietnamese philosophy and Eastern philosophyEast Asian philosophical thought began in Ancient China and Chinese philosophy begins during the Western Zhou Dynasty and the following periods after its fall when the Hundred Schools of Thought flourished th century to  BCE. This period was characterized by significant intellectual and cultural developments and saw the rise of the major philosophical schools of China Confucianism Legalism and Daoism as well as numerous other less influential schools. These philosophical traditions developed metaphysical political and ethical theories such Tao Yin and yang Ren and Li which along with Chinese Buddhism directly influenced Korean philosophy Vietnamese philosophy and Japanese philosophy which also includes the native Shinto tradition. Buddhism began arriving in China during the Han Dynasty  BCE –  CE through a gradual Silk road transmission and through native influences developed distinct Chinese forms such as Chan/Zen which spread throughout the East Asian cultural sphere. During later Chinese dynasties like the Ming Dynasty – as well as in the Korean Joseon dynasty – a resurgent Neo-Confucianism led by thinkers such as Wang Yangming – became the dominant school of thought and was promoted by the imperial state.In the Modern era Chinese thinkers incorporated ideas from Western philosophy. Chinese Marxist philosophy developed under the influence of Mao Zedong while a Chinese pragmatism under Hu Shih and New Confucianisms rise was influenced by Xiong Shili. Modern Japanese thought meanwhile developed under strong Western influences such as the study of Western Sciences Rangaku and the modernist Meirokusha intellectual society which drew from European enlightenment thought. The th century saw the rise of State Shinto and also Japanese nationalism. The Kyoto School an influential and unique Japanese philosophical school developed from Western phenomenology and Medieval Japanese Buddhist philosophy such as that of Dogen.African philosophy is philosophy produced by African people philosophy that presents African worldviews ideas and themes or philosophy that uses distinct African philosophical methods. Modern African thought has been occupied with Ethnophilosophy with defining the very meaning of African philosophy and its unique characteristics and what it means to be African. During the th century Ethiopian philosophy developed a robust literary tradition as exemplified by Zera Yacob. Another early African philosopher was Anton Wilhelm Amo c. – who became a respected philosopher in Germany. Distinct African philosophical ideas include Ujamaa the Bantu idea of Force Négritude Pan-Africanism and Ubuntu. Contemporary African thought has also seen the development of Professional philosophy and of Africana philosophy the philosophical literature of the African diaspora which includes currents such as black existentialism by African-Americans. Some modern African thinkers have been influenced by Marxism African-American literature Critical theory Critical race theory Postcolonialism and Feminism.A Tlamatini Aztec philosopher observing the stars from the Codex Mendoza.Indigenous-American philosophical thought consists of a wide variety of beliefs and traditions among different American cultures. Among some of U.S. Native American communities there is a belief in a metaphysical principle called the Great Spirit Siouan: wakȟáŋ tȟáŋka; Algonquian: gitche manitou. Another widely shared concept was that of orenda spiritual power. According to Whiteley  for the Native Americans mind is critically informed by transcendental experience dreams visions and so on as well as by reason. The practices to access these transcendental experiences are termed shamanism. Another feature of the indigenous American worldviews was their extension of ethics to non-human animals and plants.In Mesoamerica Aztec philosophy was an intellectual tradition developed by individuals called Tlamatini those who know something and its ideas are preserved in various Aztec codices. The Aztec worldview posited the concept of an ultimate universal energy or force called Ōmeteōtl Dual Cosmic Energy which sought a way to live in balance with a constantly changing slippery world.The theory of Teotl can be seen as a form of Pantheism. Aztec philosophers developed theories of metaphysics epistemology values and aesthetics. Aztec ethics was focused on seeking tlamatiliztli knowledge wisdom which was based on moderation and balance in all actions as in the Nahua proverb the middle good is necessary.The Inca civilization also had an elite class of philosopher-scholars termed the Amawtakuna who were important in the Inca education system as teachers of religion tradition history and ethics. Key concepts of Andean thought are Yanantin and Masintin which involve a theory of “complementary opposites” that sees polarities such as male/female dark/light as interdependent parts of a harmonious whole.Although men have generally dominated philosophical discourse women philosophers have engaged in the discipline throughout history. Ancient examples include Hipparchia of Maroneia active c.  BCE and Arete of Cyrene active th–th centuries BCE. Some women philosophers were accepted during the medieval and modern eras but none became part of the Western canon until the th and st century when many suggest that G.E.M. Anscombe Hannah Arendt Simone de Beauvoir and Susanne Langer entered the canon.In the early s some colleges and universities in the UK and US began admitting women producing more female academics. Nevertheless U.S. Department of Education reports from the s indicate that few women ended up in philosophy and that philosophy is one of the least gender-proportionate fields in the humanities with women making up somewhere between % and % of philosophy faculty according to some studies.Philosophical questions can be grouped into various branches. These groupings allow philosophers to focus on a set of similar topics and interact with other thinkers who are interested in the same questions. The groupings also make philosophy easier for students to approach. Students can learn the basic principles involved in one aspect of the field without being overwhelmed with the entire set of philosophical theories.Various sources present different categorical schemes. The categories adopted in this article aim for breadth and simplicity.These five major branches can be separated into sub-branches and each sub-branch contains many specific fields of study:These divisions are neither exhaustive nor mutually exclusive. A philosopher might specialize in Kantian epistemology or Platonic aesthetics or modern political philosophy. Furthermore these philosophical inquiries sometimes overlap with each other and with other inquiries such as science religion or mathematics.Dignaga founded a school of Buddhist epistemology and logic.Epistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies knowledge. Epistemologists examine putative sources of knowledge including perceptual experience reason memory and testimony. They also investigate questions about the nature of truth belief justification and rationality.One of the most notable epistemological debates in the early modern period was between empiricism and rationalism. Empiricism places emphasis on observational evidence via sensory experience as the source of knowledge. Empiricism is associated with a posteriori knowledge which is obtained through experience such as scientific knowledge. Rationalism places emphasis on reason as a source of knowledge. Rationalism is associated with a priori knowledge which is independent of experience such as logic and mathematics.Philosophical skepticism which raises doubts some or all claims to knowledge has been a topic of interest throughout the history of philosophy. Philosophical skepticism dates back thousands of years to ancient philosophers like Pyrrho and features prominently in the works of modern philosophers René Descartes and David Hume. Skepticism has remained a central topic in contemporary epistemological debates.One central debate in contemporary epistemology is about the conditions required for a belief to constitute knowledge which might include truth and justification. This debate was largely the result of attempts to solve the Gettier problem. Another common subject of contemporary debates is the regress problem which occurs when trying to offer proof or justification for any belief statement or proposition. The problem is that whatever the source of justification may be that source must either be without justification in which case it must be treated as an arbitrary foundation for belief or it must have some further justification in which case justification must either be the result of circular reasoning as in coherentism or the result of an infinite regress as in infinitism.Metaphysics is the study of the most general features of reality such as existence time objects and their properties wholes and their parts events processes and causation and the relationship between mind and body. Metaphysics includes cosmology the study of the world in its entirety and ontology the study of being.A major point of debate is between realism which holds that there are entities that exist independently of their mental perception and idealism which holds that reality is mentally constructed or otherwise immaterial. Metaphysics deals with the topic of identity. Essence is the set of attributes that make an object what it fundamentally is and without which it loses its identity while accident is a property that the object has without which the object can still retain its identity. Particulars are objects that are said to exist in space and time as opposed to abstract objects such as numbers and universals which are properties held by multiple particulars such as redness or a gender. The type of existence if any of universals and abstract objects is an issue of debate.Several subfields of philosophy are closely related to epistemology and metaphysics most notably philosophy of mind and philosophy of language. All of these are sometimes grouped together as core fields in philosophy although this terminology is now considered outdated. Philosophy of language explores the nature origins and use of language. Philosophy of mind explores the nature of the mind and its relationship to the body as typified by disputes between materialism and dualism. In recent years this branch has become related to cognitive science.Value theory or axiology is the major branch of philosophy that addresses topics such as goodness beauty and justice. Value theory includes ethics aesthetics political philosophy feminist philosophy philosophy of law and more.citation neededThe Beijing imperial college was an intellectual center for Confucian ethics and classics during the Yuan Ming and Qing dynasties.Ethics also known as moral philosophy studies what constitutes good and bad conduct right and wrong values and good and evil. Its primary investigations include how to live a good life and identifying standards of morality. It also includes investigating whether or not there is a best way to live or a universal moral standard and if so how we come to learn about it. The main branches of ethics are normative ethics meta-ethics and applied ethics.The three main views in ethics about what constitute moral actions are:Consequentialism which judges actions based on their consequences. One such view is utilitarianism which judges actions based on the net happiness or pleasure and/or lack of suffering or pain that they produce.Deontology which judges actions based on whether or not they are in accordance with ones moral duty. In the standard form defended by Immanuel Kant deontology is concerned with whether or not a choice respects the moral agency of other people regardless of its consequences.Virtue ethics which judges actions based on the moral character of the agent who performs them and whether they conform to what an ideally virtuous agent would do.AestheticsMain article: AestheticsAesthetics is the critical reflection on art culture and nature. It addresses the nature of art beauty and taste enjoyment emotional values perception and with the creation and appreciation of beauty. It is more precisely defined as the study of sensory or sensori-emotional values sometimes called judgments of sentiment and taste. Its major divisions are art theory literary theory film theory and music theory. An example from art theory is to discern the set of principles underlying the work of a particular artist or artistic movement such as the Cubist aesthetic. The philosophy of film analyzes films and filmmakers for their philosophical content and explores film images cinema etc. as a medium for philosophical reflection and expression.citation neededThomas Hobbes best known for his Leviathan which expounded an influential formulation of social contract theory.Political philosophy is the study of government and the relationship of individuals or families and clans to communities including the state.citation needed It includes questions about justice law property and the rights and obligations of the citizen. Politics and ethics are traditionally linked subjects as both discuss the question of how people should live together.citation neededPhilosophy of law aka jurisprudence: explores the varying theories explaining the nature and interpretation of laws.Philosophy of education: analyzes the definition and content of education as well as the goals and challenges of educators.Feminist philosophy: explores questions surrounding gender sexuality and the body including the nature of feminism itself as a social and philosophical movement.Logic science and mathematicsThis article may not properly summarize its corresponding main article. Please help improve it by rewriting it in an encyclopedic style. June  Learn how and when to remove this template messageThe topics of philosophy of science are numbers symbols and the formal methods of reasoning as employed in the social sciences and natural sciences.citation neededLogic is the study of reasoning and argument. An argument is a connected series of statements intended to establish a proposition.citation needed The connected series of statements are premises and the proposition is the conclusion. For example:All humans are mortal. premiseSocrates is a human. premiseTherefore Socrates is mortal. conclusionDeductive reasoning is when given certain premises conclusions are unavoidably implied. Rules of inference are used to infer conclusions such as modus ponens where given “A” and “If A then B” then “B” must be concluded.Because sound reasoning is an essential element of all sciences social sciences and humanities disciplines logic became a formal science. Sub-fields include mathematical logic philosophical logic Modal logic computational logic and non-classical logics. A major question in the philosophy of mathematics is whether mathematical entities are objective and discovered called mathematical realism or invented called mathematical antirealism.This branch explores the foundations methods history implications and purpose of science. Many of its sub-divisions correspond to a specific branch of science. For example philosophy of biology deals specifically with the metaphysical epistemological and ethical issues in the biomedical and life sciences. The philosophy of mathematics studies the philosophical assumptions foundations and implications of mathematics.citation neededSome contemporary philosophers specialize in studying one or more historical periods. The history of philosophy study of a specific period individual or school should not be confused with the philosophy of history a minor subfield most commonly associated with historicism as first defended in Hegels Lectures on the Philosophy of History.citation neededPhilosophy of religion deals with questions that involve religion and religious ideas from a philosophically neutral perspective as opposed to theology which begins from religious convictions. Traditionally religious questions were not seen as a separate field from philosophy proper the idea of a separate field only arose in the th century.xiiIssues include the existence of God the relationship between reason and faith questions of religious epistemology the relationship between religion and science how to interpret religious experiences questions about the possibility of an afterlife the problem of religious language and the existence of souls and responses to religious pluralism and diversity.Metaphilosophy explores the aims of philosophy its boundaries and its methods.A variety of other academic and non-academic approaches have been explored. The ideas conceived by a society have profound repercussions on what actions the society performs. Weaver argued that ideas have consequences.Philosophy yields applications such as those in ethics—applied ethics in particular—and political philosophy. The political and economic philosophies of Confucius Sun Tzu Chanakya Ibn Khaldun Ibn Rushd Ibn Taymiyyah Machiavelli Leibniz Hobbes Locke Rousseau Adam Smith John Stuart Mill Marx Tolstoy Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. have been used to shape and justify governments and their actions. Progressive education as championed by Dewey had a profound impact on th-century US educational practices. Descendants of this movement include efforts in philosophy for children which are part of philosophy education. Clausewitzs political philosophy of war has had a profound effect on statecraft international politics and military strategy in the th century especially around World War II. Logic is important in mathematics linguistics psychology computer science and computer engineering.Other important applications can be found in epistemology which aid in understanding the requisites for knowledge sound evidence and justified belief important in law economics decision theory and a number of other disciplines. The philosophy of science discusses the underpinnings of the scientific method and has affected the nature of scientific investigation and argumentation. Philosophy thus has fundamental implications for science as a whole. For example the strictly empirical approach of B.F. Skinners behaviorism affected for decades the approach of the American psychological establishment. Deep ecology and animal rights examine the moral situation of humans as occupants of a world that has non-human occupants to consider also. Aesthetics can help to interpret discussions of music literature the plastic arts and the whole artistic dimension of life. In general the various philosophies strive to provide practical activities with a deeper understanding of the theoretical or conceptual underpinnings of their fields.The relationship between X and the philosophy of X is often intensely debated. Richard Feynman argued that the philosophy of a topic is irrelevant to its primary study saying that philosophy of science is as useful to scientists as ornithology is to birds.citation needed Curtis White  by contrast argued that philosophical tools are essential to humanities sciences and social sciences.Main article: Contemporary philosophy § Outside the professionMany inquiries outside of academia are philosophical in the broad sense. Novelists playwrights filmmakers and musicians as well as scientists and others engage in recognizably philosophical activity.Some of those who study philosophy become professional philosophers typically by working as professors who teach research and write in academic institutions. However most students of academic philosophy later contribute to law journalism religion sciences politics business or various arts. For example public figures who have degrees in philosophy include comedians Steve Martin and Ricky Gervais filmmaker Terrence Malick Pope John Paul II Wikipedia co-founder Larry Sanger technology entrepreneur Peter Thiel Supreme Court Justice Stephen Bryer and vice presidential candidate Carly Fiorina.Recent efforts to avail the general public to the work and relevance of philosophers include the million-dollar Berggruen Prize first awarded to Charles Taylor in .Germany was the first country to professionalize philosophy. The doctorate of philosophy PhD developed in Germany as the terminal Teachers credential in the mid th century. At the end of  Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel was the first philosopher to be appointed Professor by the State namely by the Prussian Minister of Education as an effect of Napoleonic reform in Prussia. In the United States the professionalization grew out of reforms to the American higher-education system largely based on the German model.Within the last century philosophy has increasingly become a professional discipline practiced within universities like other academic disciplines. Accordingly it has become less general and more specialized. In the view of one prominent recent historian: Philosophy has become a highly organized discipline done by specialists primarily for other specialists. The number of philosophers has exploded the volume of publication has swelled and the subfields of serious philosophical investigation have multiplied. Not only is the broad field of philosophy today far too vast to be embraced by one mind something similar is true even of many highly specialized subfields. Some philosophers argue that this professionalization has negatively affected the discipline.The end result of professionalization for philosophy has meant that work being done in the field is now almost exclusively done by university professors holding a doctorate in the field publishing in highly technical peer-reviewed journals. While it remains common among the population at large for a person to have a set of religious political or philosophical views that they consider their philosophy these views are rarely informed by or connected to the work being done in professional philosophy today. Furthermore unlike many of the sciences for which there has come to be a healthy industry of books magazines and television shows meant to popularize science and communicate the technical results of a scientific field to the general populace works by professional philosophers directed at an audience outside the profession remain rare. Philosopher Michael Sandels book Justice: Whats the Right Thing to Do and Harry Frankfurts On Bullshit are examples of works that hold the uncommon distinction of having been written by professional philosophers but directed at and ultimately popular among a broader audience of non-philosophers. Both works became New York Times best sellers.This article is about the usage of premise in discourse and logic. For other uses see Premise disambiguation.A premise or premissa is a statement that an argument claims will induce or justify a conclusion. It is an assumption that something is true.In logic an argument requires a set of at least two declarative sentences or propositions known as the premises or premisses along with another declarative sentence or proposition known as the conclusion. This structure of two premises and one conclusion forms the basic argumentative structure. More complex arguments can use a sequence of rules to connect several premises to one conclusion or to derive a number of conclusions from the original premises which then act as premises for additional conclusions. An example of this is the use of the rules of inference found within symbolic logic.Aristotle held that any logical argument could be reduced to two premises and a conclusion. Premises are sometimes left unstated in which case they are called missing premises for example:Socrates is mortal because all men are mortal.It is evident that a tacitly understood claim is that Socrates is a man. The fully expressed reasoning is thus:Because all men are mortal and Socrates is a man Socrates is mortal.In this example the independent clauses preceding the comma namely all men are mortal and Socrates is a man are the premises while Socrates is mortal is the conclusion.The proof of a conclusion depends on both the truth of the premises and the validity of the argument. Also additional information is required over and above the meaning of the premise to determine if the full meaning of the conclusion coincides with what is.For Euclid premises constitute two of the three propositions in a syllogism with the other being the conclusion. These categorical propositions contain three terms: subject and predicate of the conclusion and the middle term. The subject of the conclusion is called the minor term while the predicate is the major term. The premise that contains the middle term and major term is called the major premise while the premise that contains the middle term and minor term is called the minor premise.A premise can also be an indicator word if statements have been combined into a logical argument and such word functions to mark the role of one or more of the statements. It indicates that the statement it is attached to is a premise. In general usage the spelling premise is most common; however in the field of logic the spelling premiss is often used especially among British writers.References Audi Robert ed. .

It is the scientific study of the origin evolution and eventual fate of the universe. Physical cosmology is the scientific study of the universes origin its large-scale structures and dynamics and its ultimate fate as well as the laws of science that govern these areas.The term cosmology was first used in English in  in Thomas Blounts Glossographia and in  taken up in Latin by German philosopher Christian Wolff in Cosmologia Generalis.Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological religious and esoteric literature and traditions of creation myths and eschatology.Physical cosmology is studied by scientists such as astronomers and physicists as well as philosophers such as metaphysicians philosophers of physics and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions and may depend upon assumptions that cannot be tested. Cosmology differs from astronomy in that the former is concerned with the Universe as a whole while the latter deals with individual celestial objects. Modern physical cosmology is dominated by the Big Bang theory which attempts to bring together observational astronomy and particle physics; more specifically a standard parameterization of the Big Bang with dark matter and dark energy known as the Lambda-CDM model.Theoretical astrophysicist David N. Spergel has described cosmology as a historical science because when we look out in space we look back in time due to the finite nature of the speed of light.The image above contains clickable linksSee also: Human timeline and Life timeline.Physics and astrophysics have played a central role in shaping the understanding of the universe through scientific observation and experiment. Physical cosmology was shaped through both mathematics and observation in an analysis of the whole universe. The universe is generally understood to have begun with the Big Bang followed almost instantaneously by cosmic inflation; an expansion of space from which the universe is thought to have emerged . ± . billion years ago. Cosmogony studies the origin of the Universe and cosmography maps the features of the Universe.In Diderots Encyclopédie cosmology is broken down into uranology the science of the heavens aerology the science of the air geology the science of the continents and hydrology the science of waters.Metaphysical cosmology has also been described as the placing of humans in the universe in relationship to all other entities. This is exemplified by Marcus Aureliuss observation that a mans place in that relationship: He who does not know what the world is does not know where he is and he who does not know for what purpose the world exists does not know who he is nor what the world is.Physical cosmology is the branch of physics and astrophysics that deals with the study of the physical origins and evolution of the Universe. It also includes the study of the nature of the Universe on a large scale. In its earliest form it was what is now known as celestial mechanics the study of the heavens. Greek philosophers Aristarchus of Samos Aristotle and Ptolemy proposed different cosmological theories. The geocentric Ptolemaic system was the prevailing theory until the th century when Nicolaus Copernicus and subsequently Johannes Kepler and Galileo Galilei proposed a heliocentric system. This is one of the most famous examples of epistemological rupture in physical cosmology.Evidence of gravitational waves in the infant universe may have been uncovered by the microscopic examination of the focal plane of the BICEP radio telescope.Isaac Newtons Principia Mathematica published in  was the first description of the law of universal gravitation. It provided a physical mechanism for Keplers laws and also allowed the anomalies in previous systems caused by gravitational interaction between the planets to be resolved. A fundamental difference between Newtons cosmology and those preceding it was the Copernican principle—that the bodies on earth obey the same physical laws as all the celestial bodies. This was a crucial philosophical advance in physical cosmology.Modern scientific cosmology is usually considered to have begun in  with Albert Einsteins publication of his final modification of general relativity in the paper Cosmological Considerations of the General Theory of Relativity although this paper was not widely available outside of Germany until the end of World War I. General relativity prompted cosmogonists such as Willem de Sitter Karl Schwarzschild and Arthur Eddington to explore its astronomical ramifications which enhanced the ability of astronomers to study very distant objects. Physicists began changing the assumption that the Universe was static and unchanging. In  Alexander Friedmann introduced the idea of an expanding universe that contained moving matter. Around the same time  to  the Great Debate took place with early cosmologists such as Heber Curtis and Ernst Öpik determining that some nebulae seen in telescopes were separate galaxies far distant from our own.In parallel to this dynamic approach to cosmology one long-standing debate about the structure of the cosmos was coming to a climax. Mount Wilson astronomer Harlow Shapley championed the model of a cosmos made up of the Milky Way star system only; while Heber D. Curtis argued for the idea that spiral nebulae were star systems in their own right as island universes. This difference of ideas came to a climax with the organization of the Great Debate on  April  at the meeting of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences in Washington D.C. The debate was resolved when Edwin Hubble detected Cepheid Variables in the Andromeda Galaxy in  and . Their distance established spiral nebulae well beyond the edge of the Milky Way.Subsequent modelling of the universe explored the possibility that the cosmological constant introduced by Einstein in his  paper may result in an expanding universe depending on its value. Thus the Big Bang model was proposed by the Belgian priest Georges Lemaître in  which was subsequently corroborated by Edwin Hubbles discovery of the redshift in  and later by the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation by Arno Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson in . These findings were a first step to rule out some of many alternative cosmologies.Since around  several dramatic advances in observational cosmology have transformed cosmology from a largely speculative science into a predictive science with precise agreement between theory and observation. These advances include observations of the microwave background from the COBE WMAP and Planck satellites large new galaxy redshift surveys including dfGRS and SDSS and observations of distant supernovae and gravitational lensing. These observations matched the predictions of the cosmic inflation theory a modified Big Bang theory and the specific version known as the Lambda-CDM model. This has led many to refer to modern times as the golden age of cosmology.On  March  astronomers at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics announced the detection of gravitational waves providing strong evidence for inflation and the Big Bang. However on  June  lowered confidence in confirming the cosmic inflation findings was reported.On  December  at the Planck  meeting in Ferrara Italy astronomers reported that the universe is . billion years old and is composed of .% atomic matter .% dark matter and .% dark energy.Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological religious and esoteric literature and traditions of creation and eschatology.Cosmology deals with the world as the totality of space time and all phenomena. Historically it has had quite a broad scope and in many cases was founded in religion. In modern use metaphysical cosmology addresses questions about the Universe which are beyond the scope of science. It is distinguished from religious cosmology in that it approaches these questions using philosophical methods like dialectics. Modern metaphysical cosmology tries to address questions such as:What is the origin of the Universe What is its first cause Is its existence necessary see monism pantheism emanationism and creationismWhat are the ultimate material components of the Universe see mechanism dynamism hylomorphism atomismWhat is the ultimate reason for the existence of the Universe Does the cosmos have a purpose see teleologyDoes the existence of consciousness have a purpose How do we know what we know about the totality of the cosmos Does cosmological reasoning reveal metaphysical truths see epistemologyHistorical cosmologiesFurther information: Timeline of cosmological theories and Nicolaus Copernicus § Copernican systemKinematic expansion without space expansion	Rejects general relativity and the expanding space paradigm.

In other words universals are repeatable or recurrent entities that can be instantiated or exemplified by many particular things. For example suppose there are two chairs in a room each of which is green. These two chairs both share the quality of chairness as well as greenness or the quality of being green; in other words they share a universal. There are three major kinds of qualities or characteristics: types or kinds e.g. mammal properties e.g. short strong and relations e.g. father of next to. These are all different types of universals.Paradigmatically universals are abstract e.g. humanity whereas particulars are concrete e.g. the personhood of Socrates. However universals are not necessarily abstract and particulars are not necessarily concrete. For example one might hold that numbers are particular yet abstract objects. Likewise some philosophers such as D. M. Armstrong consider universals to be concrete.Most do not consider classes to be universals although some prominent philosophers do as John Bigelow.The history of any creation went through a process of qualifications meeting dependancies of that type thing including all parts put together to make it an accepted thing of its particular type. A chair must first exist upon a surface with the force of gravity upon it. The chair must be upon something solid and it must provide a platform for something to sit upon. Any other universals for “chairness” must qualify the particular dependencies set forth by authority. The first chair qualified itself as a chair from it’s propriety. Universals exist in every created thing but only in the individual subparts themselves not in the whole thing itself. Universals can be thought of as an evolution of a creation’s life constantly on a journey towards perfection.The problem of universals is an ancient problem in metaphysics about whether universals exist. The problem arises from attempts to account for the phenomenon of similarity or attribute agreement among things. For example grass and Granny Smith apples are similar or agree in attribute namely in having the attribute of greenness. The issue is how to account for this sort of agreement in attribute among things.There are many philosophical positions regarding universals. Taking beauty as an example three positions are:Idealism or conceptualism: beauty is a property constructed in the mind so it exists only in descriptions of things.Platonic realism: beauty is a property that exists in an ideal form independently of any mind or thing.Aristotelian realism: beauty is a property that only exists when beautiful things exist.Taking a broader view the main positions are generally considered classifiable as: realism nominalism and idealism sometimes simply named anti-realism with regard to universals. Realists posit the existence of independent abstract universals to account for attribute agreement. Nominalists deny that universals exist claiming that they are not necessary to explain attribute agreement. Conceptualists posit that universals exist only in the mind or when conceptualized denying the independent existence of universals. Complications which arise include the implications of language use and the complexity of relating language to ontology.A universal may have instances known as its particulars. For example the type dog or doghood is a universal as are the property red or redness and the relation betweenness or being between. Any particular dog red thing or object that is between other things is not a universal however but is an instance of a universal. That is a universal type doghood property redness or relation betweenness inheres in a particular object a specific dog red thing or object between other things.Platonic realism holds universals to be the referents of general terms such as the abstract nonphysical non-mental entities to which words such as sameness circularity and beauty refer. Particulars are the referents of proper names such as Phaedo or of definite descriptions that identify single objects such as the phrase that bed over there. Other metaphysical theories may use the terminology of universals to describe physical entities.Platos examples of what we might today call universals included mathematical and geometrical ideas such as a circle and natural numbers as universals. Platos views on universals did however vary across several different discussions. In some cases Plato spoke as if the perfect circle functioned as the form or blueprint for all copies and for the word definition of circle. In other discussions Plato describes particulars as participating in the associated universal.Contemporary realists agree with the thesis that universals are multiply-exemplifiable entities. Examples include by D. M. Armstrong Nicholas Wolterstorff Reinhardt Grossmann Michael Loux.Nominalists hold that universals are not real mind-independent entities but either merely concepts sometimes called conceptualism or merely names. Nominalists typically argue that properties are abstract particulars like tropes rather than universals. JP Moreland distinguishes between extreme and moderate nominalism. Examples of nominalists include the medieval philosophers Roscelin of Compiègne and William of Ockham and contemporary philosophers W. V. O. Quine Wilfred Sellars D. C. Williams and Keith Campbell.The ness-ity-hood principle is used mainly by English-speaking philosophers to generate convenient concise names for universals or properties. According to the Ness-Ity-Hood Principle a name for any universal may be formed that is distinctive of left-handers may be formed by taking the predicate left-handed and adding ness which yields the name left-handedness. The principle is most helpful in cases where there is not an established or standard name of the universal in ordinary English usage: What is the name of the universal distinctive of chairs Chair in English is used not only as a subject as in The chair is broken but also as a predicate as in That is a chair. So to generate a name for the universal distinctive of chairs take the predicate chair and add ness which yields chairness.Memory is the faculty of the brain by which data or information is encoded stored and retrieved when needed. It is the retention of information over time for the purpose of influencing future action. If past events could not be remembered it would be impossible for language relationships or personal identity to develop. Memory loss is usually described as forgetfulness or amnesia.Memory is often understood as an informational processing system with explicit and implicit functioning that is made up of a sensory processor short-term or working memory and long-term memory. This can be related to the neuron. The sensory processor allows information from the outside world to be sensed in the form of chemical and physical stimuli and attended to various levels of focus and intent. Working memory serves as an encoding and retrieval processor. Information in the form of stimuli is encoded in accordance with explicit or implicit functions by the working memory processor. The working memory also retrieves information from previously stored material. Finally the function of long-term memory is to store data through various categorical models or systems.Declarative or explicit memory is the conscious storage and recollection of data. Under declarative memory resides semantic and episodic memory. Semantic memory refers to memory that is encoded with specific meaning while episodic memory refers to information that is encoded along a spatial and temporal plane. Declarative memory is usually the primary process thought of when referencing memory. Non-declarative or implicit memory is the unconscious storage and recollection of information. An example of a non-declarative process would be the unconscious learning or retrieval of information by way of procedural memory or a priming phenomenon. Priming is the process of subliminally arousing specific responses from memory and shows that not all memory is consciously activated whereas procedural memory is the slow and gradual learning of skills that often occurs without conscious attention to learning.Memory is not a perfect processor and is affected by many factors. The ways by which information is encoded stored and retrieved can all be corrupted. The amount of attention given new stimuli can diminish the amount of information that becomes encoded for storage. Also the storage process can become corrupted by physical damage to areas of the brain that are associated with memory storage such as the hippocampus. Finally the retrieval of information from long-term memory can be disrupted because of decay within long-term memory. Normal functioning decay over time and brain damage all affect the accuracy and capacity of the memory.Sensory memory holds information derived from the senses less than one second after an item is perceived. The ability to look at an item and remember what it looked like with just a split second of observation or memorization is the example of sensory memory. It is out of cognitive control and is an automatic response. With very short presentations participants often report that they seem to see more than they can actually report. The first experiments exploring this form of sensory memory were precisely conducted by George Sperling  using the partial report paradigm. Subjects were presented with a grid of  letters arranged into three rows of four. After a brief presentation subjects were then played either a high medium or low tone cuing them which of the rows to report. Based on these partial report experiments Sperling was able to show that the capacity of sensory memory was approximately  items but that it degraded very quickly within a few hundred milliseconds. Because this form of memory degrades so quickly participants would see the display but be unable to report all of the items  in the whole report procedure before they decayed. This type of memory cannot be prolonged via rehearsal.Three types of sensory memories exist. Iconic memory is a fast decaying store of visual information a type of sensory memory that briefly stores an image that has been perceived for a small duration. Echoic memory is a fast decaying store of auditory information also a sensory memory that briefly stores sounds that have been perceived for short durations. Haptic memory is a type of sensory memory that represents a database for touch stimuli.Short-term memory is also known as working memory. Short-term memory allows recall for a period of several seconds to a minute without rehearsal. Its capacity however is very limited. In  George A. Miller - when working at Bell Laboratories conducted experiments showing that the store of short-term memory was ± items. Hence the title of his famous paper The Magical Number ±. Modern estimates of the capacity of short-term memory are lower typically of the order of – items; however memory capacity can be increased through a process called chunking. For example in recalling a ten-digit telephone number a person could chunk the digits into three groups: first the area code such as  then a three-digit chunk  and last a four-digit chunk . This method of remembering telephone numbers is far more effective than attempting to remember a string of  digits; this is because we are able to chunk the information into meaningful groups of numbers. This is reflected in some countries tendencies to display telephone numbers as several chunks of two to four numbers.Short-term memory is believed to rely mostly on an acoustic code for storing information and to a lesser extent on a visual code. Conrad  found that test subjects had more difficulty recalling collections of letters that were acoustically similar e.g. E P D. Confusion with recalling acoustically similar letters rather than visually similar letters implies that the letters were encoded acoustically. Conrads  study however deals with the encoding of written text; thus while memory of written language may rely on acoustic components generalizations to all forms of memory cannot be made.Olin Levi Warner Memory . Library of Congress Thomas Jefferson Building Washington D.C.The storage in sensory memory and short-term memory generally has a strictly limited capacity and duration which means that information is not retained indefinitely. By contrast long-term memory can store much larger quantities of information for potentially unlimited duration sometimes a whole life span. Its capacity is immeasurable. For example given a random seven-digit number one may remember it for only a few seconds before forgetting suggesting it was stored in short-term memory. On the other hand one can remember telephone numbers for many years through repetition; this information is said to be stored in long-term memory.While short-term memory encodes information acoustically long-term memory encodes it semantically: Baddeley  discovered that after  minutes test subjects had the most difficulty recalling a collection of words that had similar meanings e.g. big large great huge long-term. Another part of long-term memory is episodic memory which attempts to capture information such as what when and where. With episodic memory individuals are able to recall specific events such as birthday parties and weddings.Short-term memory is supported by transient patterns of neuronal communication dependent on regions of the frontal lobe especially dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the parietal lobe. Long-term memory on the other hand is maintained by more stable and permanent changes in neural connections widely spread throughout the brain. The hippocampus is essential for learning new information to the consolidation of information from short-term to long-term memory although it does not seem to store information itself. It was thought that without the hippocampus new memories were unable to be stored into long-term memory and that there would be a very short attention span as first gleaned from patient Henry Molaison after what was thought to be the full removal of both his hippocampi. More recent examination of his brain post-mortem shows that the hippocampus was more intact than first thought throwing theories drawn from the initial data into question. The hippocampus may be involved in changing neural connections for a period of three months or more after the initial learning.Research has suggested that long-term memory storage in humans may be maintained by DNA methylation and the prion gene.The multi-store model also known as Atkinson–Shiffrin memory model was first described in  by Atkinson and Shiffrin.The multi-store model has been criticised for being too simplistic. For instance long-term memory is believed to be actually made up of multiple subcomponents such as episodic and procedural memory. It also proposes that rehearsal is the only mechanism by which information eventually reaches long-term storage but evidence shows us capable of remembering things without rehearsal.The model also shows all the memory stores as being a single unit whereas research into this shows differently. For example short-term memory can be broken up into different units such as visual information and acoustic information. In a study by Zlonoga and Gerber  patient KF demonstrated certain deviations from the Atkinson–Shiffrin model. Patient KF was brain damaged displaying difficulties regarding short-term memory. Recognition of sounds such as spoken numbers letters words and easily identifiable noises such as doorbells and cats meowing were all impacted. Visual short-term memory was unaffected suggesting a dichotomy between visual and audial memory.In  Baddeley and Hitch proposed a working memory model that replaced the general concept of short-term memory with an active maintenance of information in the short-term storage. In this model working memory consists of three basic stores: the central executive the phonological loop and the visuo-spatial sketchpad. In  this model was expanded with the multimodal episodic buffer Baddeleys model of working memory.The central executive essentially acts as an attention sensory store. It channels information to the three component processes: the phonological loop the visuo-spatial sketchpad and the episodic buffer.The phonological loop stores auditory information by silently rehearsing sounds or words in a continuous loop: the articulatory process for example the repetition of a telephone number over and over again. A short list of data is easier to remember.The visuospatial sketchpad stores visual and spatial information. It is engaged when performing spatial tasks such as judging distances or visual ones such as counting the windows on a house or imagining images.The episodic buffer is dedicated to linking information across domains to form integrated units of visual spatial and verbal information and chronological ordering e.g. the memory of a story or a movie scene. The episodic buffer is also assumed to have links to long-term memory and semantical meaning.The working memory model explains many practical observations such as why it is easier to do two different tasks one verbal and one visual than two similar tasks e.g. two visual and the aforementioned word-length effect. Working memory is also the premise for what allows us to do everyday activities involving thought. It is the section of memory where we carry out thought processes and use them to learn and reason about topics.Researchers distinguish between recognition and recall memory. Recognition memory tasks require individuals to indicate whether they have encountered a stimulus such as a picture or a word before. Recall memory tasks require participants to retrieve previously learned information. For example individuals might be asked to produce a series of actions they have seen before or to say a list of words they have heard before.Topographic memory involves the ability to orient oneself in space to recognize and follow an itinerary or to recognize familiar places. Getting lost when traveling alone is an example of the failure of topographic memory.Flashbulb memories are clear episodic memories of unique and highly emotional events. People remembering where they were or what they were doing when they first heard the news of President Kennedys assassination the Sydney Siege or of / are examples of flashbulb memories.Anderson  divides long-term memory into declarative explicit and procedural implicit memories.Declarative memory requires conscious recall in that some conscious process must call back the information. It is sometimes called explicit memory since it consists of information that is explicitly stored and retrieved.Declarative memory can be further sub-divided into semantic memory concerning principles and facts taken independent of context; and episodic memory concerning information specific to a particular context such as a time and place. Semantic memory allows the encoding of abstract knowledge about the world such as Paris is the capital of France. Episodic memory on the other hand is used for more personal memories such as the sensations emotions and personal associations of a particular place or time. Episodic memories often reflect the firsts in life such as a first kiss first day of school or first time winning a championship. These are key events in ones life that can be remembered clearly. Research suggests that declarative memory is supported by several functions of the medial temporal lobe system which includes the hippocampus. Autobiographical memory – memory for particular events within ones own life – is generally viewed as either equivalent to or a subset of episodic memory. Visual memory is part of memory preserving some characteristics of our senses pertaining to visual experience. One is able to place in memory information that resembles objects places animals or people in sort of a mental image. Visual memory can result in priming and it is assumed some kind of perceptual representational system underlies this phenomenon.In contrast procedural memory or implicit memory is not based on the conscious recall of information but on implicit learning. It can best be summarized as remembering how to do something. Procedural memory is primarily used in learning motor skills and can be considered a subset of implicit memory. It is revealed when one does better in a given task due only to repetition – no new explicit memories have been formed but one is unconsciously accessing aspects of those previous experiences. Procedural memory involved in motor learning depends on the cerebellum and basal ganglia.A characteristic of procedural memory is that the things remembered are automatically translated into actions and thus sometimes difficult to describe. Some examples of procedural memory include the ability to ride a bike or tie shoelaces.Another major way to distinguish different memory functions is whether the content to be remembered is in the past retrospective memory or in the future prospective memory. Thus retrospective memory as a category includes semantic episodic and autobiographical memory. In contrast prospective memory is memory for future intentions or remembering to remember Winograd . Prospective memory can be further broken down into event- and time-based prospective remembering. Time-based prospective memories are triggered by a time-cue such as going to the doctor action at pm cue. Event-based prospective memories are intentions triggered by cues such as remembering to post a letter action after seeing a mailbox cue. Cues do not need to be related to the action as the mailbox/letter example and lists sticky-notes knotted handkerchiefs or string around the finger all exemplify cues that people use as strategies to enhance prospective memory.Infants do not have the language ability to report on their memories and so verbal reports cannot be used to assess very young childrens memory. Throughout the years however researchers have adapted and developed a number of measures for assessing both infants recognition memory and their recall memory. Habituation and operant conditioning techniques have been used to assess infants recognition memory and the deferred and elicited imitation techniques have been used to assess infants recall memory.Techniques used to assess infants recognition memory include the following:Visual paired comparison procedure relies on habituation: infants are first presented with pairs of visual stimuli such as two black-and-white photos of human faces for a fixed amount of time; then after being familiarized with the two photos they are presented with the familiar photo and a new photo. The time spent looking at each photo is recorded. Looking longer at the new photo indicates that they remember the familiar one. Studies using this procedure have found that - to -month-olds can retain information for as long as fourteen days.Operant conditioning technique: infants are placed in a crib and a ribbon that is connected to a mobile overhead is tied to one of their feet. Infants notice that when they kick their foot the mobile moves – the rate of kicking increases dramatically within minutes. Studies using this technique have revealed that infants memory substantially improves over the first -months. Whereas - to -month-olds can retain an operant response such as activating the mobile by kicking their foot for a week -month-olds can retain it for two weeks and -month-olds can retain a similar operant response for as long as  weeks.Techniques used to assess infants recall memory include the following:Deferred imitation technique: an experimenter shows infants a unique sequence of actions such as using a stick to push a button on a box and then after a delay asks the infants to imitate the actions. Studies using deferred imitation have shown that -month-olds memories for the sequence of actions can last for as long as four months.Elicited imitation technique: is very similar to the deferred imitation technique; the difference is that infants are allowed to imitate the actions before the delay. Studies using the elicited imitation technique have shown that -month-olds can recall the action sequences twelve months later.To assess children and older adultsResearchers use a variety of tasks to assess older children and adults memory. Some examples are:Paired associate learning – when one learns to associate one specific word with another. For example when given a word such as safe one must learn to say another specific word such as green. This is stimulus and response.Free recall – during this task a subject would be asked to study a list of words and then later they will be asked to recall or write down as many words that they can remember similar to free response questions. Earlier items are affected by retroactive interference RI which means the longer the list the greater the interference and the less likelihood that they are recalled. On the other hand items that have been presented lastly suffer little RI but suffer a great deal from proactive interference PI which means the longer the delay in recall the more likely that the items will be lost.Cued recall – one is given a significant hints to help retrieve information that has been previously encoded into the persons memory; typically this can involve a word relating to the information being asked to remember. This is similar to fill in the blank assessments used in classrooms.Recognition – subjects are asked to remember a list of words or pictures after which point they are asked to identify the previously presented words or pictures from among a list of alternatives that were not presented in the original list. This is similar to multiple choice assessments.Detection paradigm – individuals are shown a number of objects and color samples during a certain period of time. They are then tested on their visual ability to remember as much as they can by looking at testers and pointing out whether the testers are similar to the sample or if any change is present.Savings method – compares the speed of originally learning to the speed of relearning it. The amount of time saved measures memory.Implicit-memory tasks – information is drawn from memory without conscious realization.FailuresTransience – memories degrade with the passing of time. This occurs in the storage stage of memory after the information has been stored and before it is retrieved. This can happen in sensory short-term and long-term storage. It follows a general pattern where the information is rapidly forgotten during the first couple of days or years followed by small losses in later days or years.Absent-mindedness – Memory failure due to the lack of attention. Attention plays a key role in storing information into long-term memory; without proper attention the information might not be stored making it impossible to be retrieved later.Brain areas involved in the neuroanatomy of memory such as the hippocampus the amygdala the striatum or the mammillary bodies are thought to be involved in specific types of memory. For example the hippocampus is believed to be involved in spatial learning and declarative learning while the amygdala is thought to be involved in emotional memory.Damage to certain areas in patients and animal models and subsequent memory deficits is a primary source of information. However rather than implicating a specific area it could be that damage to adjacent areas or to a pathway traveling through the area is actually responsible for the observed deficit. Further it is not sufficient to describe memory and its counterpart learning as solely dependent on specific brain regions. Learning and memory are usually attributed to changes in neuronal synapses thought to be mediated by long-term potentiation and long-term depression. However this has been questioned on computational as well as neurophysiological grounds by the cognitive scientist Charles R. Gallistel and others.In general the more emotionally charged an event or experience is the better it is remembered; this phenomenon is known as the memory enhancement effect. Patients with amygdala damage however do not show a memory enhancement effect.Hebb distinguished between short-term and long-term memory. He postulated that any memory that stayed in short-term storage for a long enough time would be consolidated into a long-term memory. Later research showed this to be false. Research has shown that direct injections of cortisol or epinephrine help the storage of recent experiences. This is also true for stimulation of the amygdala. This proves that excitement enhances memory by the stimulation of hormones that affect the amygdala. Excessive or prolonged stress with prolonged cortisol may hurt memory storage. Patients with amygdalar damage are no more likely to remember emotionally charged words than nonemotionally charged ones. The hippocampus is important for explicit memory. The hippocampus is also important for memory consolidation. The hippocampus receives input from different parts of the cortex and sends its output out to different parts of the brain also. The input comes from secondary and tertiary sensory areas that have processed the information a lot already. Hippocampal damage may also cause memory loss and problems with memory storage. This memory loss includes retrograde amnesia which is the loss of memory for events that occurred shortly before the time of brain damage.Cognitive neuroscientists consider memory as the retention reactivation and reconstruction of the experience-independent internal representation. The term of internal representation implies that such a definition of memory contains two components: the expression of memory at the behavioral or conscious level and the underpinning physical neural changes Dudai . The latter component is also called engram or memory traces Semon . Some neuroscientists and psychologists mistakenly equate the concept of engram and memory broadly conceiving all persisting after-effects of experiences as memory; others argue against this notion that memory does not exist until it is revealed in behavior or thought Moscovitch .One question that is crucial in cognitive neuroscience is how information and mental experiences are coded and represented in the brain. Scientists have gained much knowledge about the neuronal codes from the studies of plasticity but most of such research has been focused on simple learning in simple neuronal circuits; it is considerably less clear about the neuronal changes involved in more complex examples of memory particularly declarative memory that requires the storage of facts and events Byrne . Convergence-divergence zones might be the neural networks where memories are stored and retrieved. Considering that there are several kinds of memory depending on types of represented knowledge underlying mechanisms processes functions and modes of acquisition it is likely that different brain areas support different memory systems and that they are in mutual relationships in neuronal networks: components of memory representation are distributed widely across different parts of the brain as mediated by multiple neocortical circuits.Encoding. Encoding of working memory involves the spiking of individual neurons induced by sensory input which persists even after the sensory input disappears Jensen and Lisman ; Fransen et al. . Encoding of episodic memory involves persistent changes in molecular structures that alter synaptic transmission between neurons. Examples of such structural changes include long-term potentiation LTP or spike-timing-dependent plasticity STDP. The persistent spiking in working memory can enhance the synaptic and cellular changes in the encoding of episodic memory Jensen and Lisman .Working memory. Recent functional imaging studies detected working memory signals in both medial temporal lobe MTL a brain area strongly associated with long-term memory and prefrontal cortex Ranganath et al.  suggesting a strong relationship between working memory and long-term memory. However the substantially more working memory signals seen in the prefrontal lobe suggest that this area play a more important role in working memory than MTL Suzuki .Consolidation and reconsolidation. Short-term memory STM is temporary and subject to disruption while long-term memory LTM once consolidated is persistent and stable. Consolidation of STM into LTM at the molecular level presumably involves two processes: synaptic consolidation and system consolidation. The former involves a protein synthesis process in the medial temporal lobe MTL whereas the latter transforms the MTL-dependent memory into an MTL-independent memory over months to years Ledoux . In recent years such traditional consolidation dogma has been re-evaluated as a result of the studies on reconsolidation. These studies showed that prevention after retrieval affects subsequent retrieval of the memory Sara . New studies have shown that post-retrieval treatment with protein synthesis inhibitors and many other compounds can lead to an amnestic state Nadel et al. b; Alberini ; Dudai . These findings on reconsolidation fit with the behavioral evidence that retrieved memory is not a carbon copy of the initial experiences and memories are updated during retrieval.Study of the genetics of human memory is in its infancy though many genes have been investigated for their association to memory in humans and non-human animals. A notable initial success was the association of APOE with memory dysfunction in Alzheimers disease. The search for genes associated with normally varying memory continues. One of the first candidates for normal variation in memory is the protein KIBRA which appears to be associated with the rate at which material is forgotten over a delay period. There has been some evidence that memories are stored in the nucleus of neurons.non-primary source neededSeveral genes proteins and enzymes have been extensively researched for their association with memory. Long-term memory unlike short-term memory is dependent upon the synthesis of new proteins. This occurs within the cellular body and concerns the particular transmitters receptors and new synapse pathways that reinforce the communicative strength between neurons. The production of new proteins devoted to synapse reinforcement is triggered after the release of certain signaling substances such as calcium within hippocampal neurons in the cell. In the case of hippocampal cells this release is dependent upon the expulsion of magnesium a binding molecule that is expelled after significant and repetitive synaptic signaling. The temporary expulsion of magnesium frees NMDA receptors to release calcium in the cell a signal that leads to gene transcription and the construction of reinforcing proteins. For more information see long-term potentiation LTP.One of the newly synthesized proteins in LTP is also critical for maintaining long-term memory. This protein is an autonomously active form of the enzyme protein kinase C PKC known as PKMζ. PKMζ maintains the activity-dependent enhancement of synaptic strength and inhibiting PKMζ erases established long-term memories without affecting short-term memory or once the inhibitor is eliminated the ability to encode and store new long-term memories is restored. Also BDNF is important for the persistence of long-term memories.The long-term stabilization of synaptic changes is also determined by a parallel increase of pre- and postsynaptic structures such as axonal bouton dendritic spine and postsynaptic density. On the molecular level an increase of the postsynaptic scaffolding proteins PSD- and HOMERc has been shown to correlate with the stabilization of synaptic enlargement. The cAMP response element-binding protein CREB is a transcription factor which is believed to be important in consolidating short-term to long-term memories and which is believed to be downregulated in Alzheimers disease.Rats exposed to an intense learning event may retain a life-long memory of the event even after a single training session. The long-term memory of such an event appears to be initially stored in the hippocampus but this storage is transient. Much of the long-term storage of the memory seems to take place in the anterior cingulate cortex. When such an exposure was experimentally applied more than  differently methylated DNA regions appeared in the hippocampus neuronal genome of the rats at one and at  hours after training. These alterations in methylation pattern occurred at many genes that were down-regulated often due to the formation of new -methylcytosine sites in CpG rich regions of the genome. Furthermore many other genes were upregulated likely often due to hypomethylation. Hypomethylation often results from the removal of methyl groups from previously existing -methylcytosines in DNA. Demethylation is carried out by several proteins acting in concert including the TET enzymes as well as enzymes of the DNA base excision repair pathway see Epigenetics in learning and memory. The pattern of induced and repressed genes in brain neurons subsequent to an intense learning event likely provides the molecular basis for a long-term memory of the event.Main article: Epigenetics in learning and memoryStudies of the molecular basis for memory formation indicate that epigenetic mechanisms operating in brain neurons play a central role in determining this capability. Key epigenetic mechanisms involved in memory include the methylation and demethylation of neuronal DNA as well as modifications of histone proteins including methylations acetylations and deacetylations.Stimulation of brain activity in memory formation is often accompanied by the generation of damage in neuronal DNA that is followed by repair associated with persistent epigenetic alterations. In particular the DNA repair processes of non-homologous end joining and base excision repair are employed in memory formation.citation neededFor the inability of adults to retrieve early memories see Childhood amnesia.Up until the mid-s it was assumed that infants could not encode retain and retrieve information. A growing body of research now indicates that infants as young as -months can recall information after a -hour delay. Furthermore research has revealed that as infants grow older they can store information for longer periods of time; -month-olds can recall information after a -hour period -month-olds after up to five weeks and -month-olds after as long as twelve months. In addition studies have shown that with age infants can store information faster. Whereas -month-olds can recall a three-step sequence after being exposed to it once -month-olds need approximately six exposures in order to be able to remember it.Although -month-olds can recall information over the short-term they have difficulty recalling the temporal order of information. It is only by  months of age that infants can recall the actions of a two-step sequence in the correct temporal order – that is recalling step  and then step . In other words when asked to imitate a two-step action sequence such as putting a toy car in the base and pushing in the plunger to make the toy roll to the other end -month-olds tend to imitate the actions of the sequence in the correct order step  and then step . Younger infants -month-olds can only recall one step of a two-step sequence. Researchers have suggested that these age differences are probably due to the fact that the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the frontal components of the neural network are not fully developed at the age of -months.In fact the term infantile amnesia refers to the phenomenon of accelerated forgetting during infancy. Importantly infantile amnesia is not unique to humans and preclinical research using rodent models provides insight into the precise neurobiology of this phenomenon. A review of the literature from behavioral neuroscientist Dr Jee Hyun Kim suggests that accelerated forgetting during early life is at least partly due to rapid growth of the brain during this period.One of the key concerns of older adults is the experience of memory loss especially as it is one of the hallmark symptoms of Alzheimers disease. However memory loss is qualitatively different in normal aging from the kind of memory loss associated with a diagnosis of Alzheimers Budson & Price . Research has revealed that individuals performance on memory tasks that rely on frontal regions declines with age. Older adults tend to exhibit deficits on tasks that involve knowing the temporal order in which they learned information; source memory tasks that require them to remember the specific circumstances or context in which they learned information; and prospective memory tasks that involve remembering to perform an act at a future time. Older adults can manage their problems with prospective memory by using appointment books for example.Gene transcription profiles were determined for the human frontal cortex of individuals from age  to  years. Numerous genes were identified with reduced expression after age  and especially after age . Genes that play central roles in memory and learning were among those showing the most significant reduction with age. There was also a marked increase in DNA damage likely oxidative damage in the promoters of those genes with reduced expression. It was suggested that DNA damage may reduce the expression of selectively vulnerable genes involved in memory and learning.Much of the current knowledge of memory has come from studying memory disorders particularly amnesia. Loss of memory is known as amnesia. Amnesia can result from extensive damage to: a the regions of the medial temporal lobe such as the hippocampus dentate gyrus subiculum amygdala the parahippocampal entorhinal and perirhinal cortices or the b midline diencephalic region specifically the dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus and the mammillary bodies of the hypothalamus. There are many sorts of amnesia and by studying their different forms it has become possible to observe apparent defects in individual sub-systems of the brains memory systems and thus hypothesize their function in the normally working brain. Other neurological disorders such as Alzheimers disease and Parkinsons disease can also affect memory and cognition. Hyperthymesia or hyperthymesic syndrome is a disorder that affects an individuals autobiographical memory essentially meaning that they cannot forget small details that otherwise would not be stored. Korsakoffs syndrome also known as Korsakoffs psychosis amnesic-confabulatory syndrome is an organic brain disease that adversely affects memory by widespread loss or shrinkage of neurons within the prefrontal cortex.While not a disorder a common temporary failure of word retrieval from memory is the tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon. Sufferers of Anomic aphasia also called Nominal aphasia or Anomia however do experience the tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon on an ongoing basis due to damage to the frontal and parietal lobes of the brain.Interference can hamper memorization and retrieval. There is retroactive interference when learning new information makes it harder to recall old information and proactive interference where prior learning disrupts recall of new information. Although interference can lead to forgetting it is important to keep in mind that there are situations when old information can facilitate learning of new information. Knowing Latin for instance can help an individual learn a related language such as French – this phenomenon is known as positive transfer.Stress has a significant effect on memory formation and learning. In response to stressful situations the brain releases hormones and neurotransmitters ex. glucocorticoids and catecholamines which affect memory encoding processes in the hippocampus. Behavioural research on animals shows that chronic stress produces adrenal hormones which impact the hippocampal structure in the brains of rats. An experimental study by German cognitive psychologists L. Schwabe and O. Wolf demonstrates how learning under stress also decreases memory recall in humans. In this study  healthy female and male university students participated in either a stress test or a control group. Those randomly assigned to the stress test group had a hand immersed in ice cold water the reputable SECPT or Socially Evaluated Cold Pressor Test for up to three minutes while being monitored and videotaped. Both the stress and control groups were then presented with  words to memorize. Twenty-four hours later both groups were tested to see how many words they could remember free recall as well as how many they could recognize from a larger list of words recognition performance. The results showed a clear impairment of memory performance in the stress test group who recalled % fewer words than the control group. The researchers suggest that stress experienced during learning distracts people by diverting their attention during the memory encoding process.However memory performance can be enhanced when material is linked to the learning context even when learning occurs under stress. A separate study by cognitive psychologists Schwabe and Wolf shows that when retention testing is done in a context similar to or congruent with the original learning task i.e. in the same room memory impairment and the detrimental effects of stress on learning can be attenuated. Seventy-two healthy female and male university students randomly assigned to the SECPT stress test or to a control group were asked to remember the locations of  pairs of picture cards – a computerized version of the card game Concentration or Memory. The room in which the experiment took place was infused with the scent of vanilla as odour is a strong cue for memory. Retention testing took place the following day either in the same room with the vanilla scent again present or in a different room without the fragrance. The memory performance of subjects who experienced stress during the object-location task decreased significantly when they were tested in an unfamiliar room without the vanilla scent an incongruent context; however the memory performance of stressed subjects showed no impairment when they were tested in the original room with the vanilla scent a congruent context. All participants in the experiment both stressed and unstressed performed faster when the learning and retrieval contexts were similar.This research on the effects of stress on memory may have practical implications for education for eyewitness testimony and for psychotherapy: students may perform better when tested in their regular classroom rather than an exam room eyewitnesses may recall details better at the scene of an event than in a courtroom and persons suffering from post-traumatic stress may improve when helped to situate their memories of a traumatic event in an appropriate context.Stressful life experiences may be a cause of memory loss as a person ages. Glucocorticoids that are released during stress damage neurons that are located in the hippocampal region of the brain. Therefore the more stressful situations that someone encounters the more susceptible they are to memory loss later on. The CA neurons found in the hippocampus are destroyed due to glucocorticoids decreasing the release of glucose and the reuptake of glutamate. This high level of extracellular glutamate allows calcium to enter NMDA receptors which in return kills neurons. Stressful life experiences can also cause repression of memories where a person moves an unbearable memory to the unconscious mind. This directly relates to traumatic events in ones past such as kidnappings being prisoners of war or sexual abuse as a child.The more long term the exposure to stress is the more impact it may have. However short term exposure to stress also causes impairment in memory by interfering with the function of the hippocampus. Research shows that subjects placed in a stressful situation for a short amount of time still have blood glucocorticoid levels that have increased drastically when measured after the exposure is completed. When subjects are asked to complete a learning task after short term exposure they often have difficulties. Prenatal stress also hinders the ability to learn and memorize by disrupting the development of the hippocampus and can lead to unestablished long term potentiation in the offspring of severely stressed parents. Although the stress is applied prenatally the offspring show increased levels of glucocorticoids when they are subjected to stress later on in life.Making memories occurs through a three-step process which can be enhanced by sleep. The three steps are as follows:Acquisition which is the process of storage and retrieval of new information in memorySleep affects memory consolidation. During sleep the neural connections in the brain are strengthened. This enhances the brains abilities to stabilize and retain memories. There have been several studies which show that sleep improves the retention of memory as memories are enhanced through active consolidation. System consolidation takes place during slow-wave sleep SWS. This process implicates that memories are reactivated during sleep but that the process doesnt enhance every memory. It also implicates that qualitative changes are made to the memories when they are transferred to long-term store during sleep. During sleep the hippocampus replays the events of the day for the neocortex. The neocortex then reviews and processes memories which moves them into long-term memory. When one does not get enough sleep it makes it more difficult to learn as these neural connections are not as strong resulting in a lower retention rate of memories. Sleep deprivation makes it harder to focus resulting in inefficient learning. Furthermore some studies have shown that sleep deprivation can lead to false memories as the memories are not properly transferred to long-term memory. One of the primary functions of sleep is thought to be the improvement of the consolidation of information as several studies have demonstrated that memory depends on getting sufficient sleep between training and test. Additionally data obtained from neuroimaging studies have shown activation patterns in the sleeping brain that mirror those recorded during the learning of tasks from the previous day suggesting that new memories may be solidified through such rehearsal.Although people often think that memory operates like recording equipment this is not the case. The molecular mechanisms underlying the induction and maintenance of memory are very dynamic and comprise distinct phases covering a time window from seconds to even a lifetime. In fact research has revealed that our memories are constructed: current hypotheses suggest that constructive processes allow individuals to simulate and imagine future episodes happenings and scenarios. Since the future is not an exact repetition of the past simulation of future episodes requires a complex system that can draw on the past in a manner that flexibly extracts and recombines elements of previous experiences – a constructive rather than a reproductive system. People can construct their memories when they encode them and/or when they recall them. To illustrate consider a classic study conducted by Elizabeth Loftus and John Palmer  in which people were instructed to watch a film of a traffic accident and then asked about what they saw. The researchers found that the people who were asked How fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other gave higher estimates than those who were asked How fast were the cars going when they hit each other Furthermore when asked a week later whether they had seen broken glass in the film those who had been asked the question with smashed were twice more likely to report that they had seen broken glass than those who had been asked the question with hit. There was no broken glass depicted in the film. Thus the wording of the questions distorted viewers memories of the event. Importantly the wording of the question led people to construct different memories of the event – those who were asked the question with smashed recalled a more serious car accident than they had actually seen. The findings of this experiment were replicated around the world and researchers consistently demonstrated that when people were provided with misleading information they tended to misremember a phenomenon known as the misinformation effect.Research has revealed that asking individuals to repeatedly imagine actions that they have never performed or events that they have never experienced could result in false memories. For instance Goff and Roediger  asked participants to imagine that they performed an act e.g. break a toothpick and then later asked them whether they had done such a thing. Findings revealed that those participants who repeatedly imagined performing such an act were more likely to think that they had actually performed that act during the first session of the experiment. Similarly Garry and her colleagues  asked college students to report how certain they were that they experienced a number of events as children e.g. broke a window with their hand and then two weeks later asked them to imagine four of those events. The researchers found that one-fourth of the students asked to imagine the four events reported that they had actually experienced such events as children. That is when asked to imagine the events they were more confident that they experienced the events.Research reported in  revealed that it is possible to artificially stimulate prior memories and artificially implant false memories in mice. Using optogenetics a team of RIKEN-MIT scientists caused the mice to incorrectly associate a benign environment with a prior unpleasant experience from different surroundings. Some scientists believe that the study may have implications in studying false memory formation in humans and in treating PTSD and schizophrenia.Memory reconsolidation is when previously consolidated memories are recalled or retrieved from long-term memory to your active consciousness. During this process memories can be further strengthened and added to but there is also risk of manipulation involved. We like to think of our memories as something stable and constant when they are stored in long-term memory but this isnt the case. There are a large number of studies that found that consolidation of memories is not a singular event but are put through the process again known as reconsolidation. This is when a memory is recalled or retrieved and placed back into your working memory. The memory is now open to manipulation from outside sources and the misinformation effect which could be due to misattributing the source of the inconsistent information with or without an intact original memory trace Lindsay and Johnson . One thing that can be sure is that memory is malleable.This new research into the concept of reconsolidation has opened the door to methods to help those with unpleasant memories or those that struggle with memories. An example of this is if you had a truly frightening experience and recall that memory in a less arousing environment the memory will be weaken the next time it is retrieved. Some studies suggest that over-trained or strongly reinforced memories do not undergo reconsolidation if reactivated the first few days after training but do become sensitive to reconsolidation interference with time. This however does not mean that all memory is susceptible to reconsolidation. There is evidence to suggest that memory that has undergone strong training and whether or not is it intentional is less likely to undergo reconsolidation. There was further testing done with rats and mazes that showed that reactivated memories were more susceptible to manipulation in both good and bad ways than newly formed memories. It is still not known whether or not these are new memories formed and its an inability to retrieve the proper one for the situation or if its a reconsolidated memory. Because the study of reconsolidation is still a newer concept there is still debate on whether it should be considered scientifically sound.A UCLA research study published in the June  issue of the American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry found that people can improve cognitive function and brain efficiency through simple lifestyle changes such as incorporating memory exercises healthy eating physical fitness and stress reduction into their daily lives. This study examined  subjects average age  with normal memory performance. Eight subjects were asked to follow a brain healthy diet relaxation physical and mental exercise brain teasers and verbal memory training techniques. After  days they showed greater word fluency not memory compared to their baseline performance. No long-term follow-up was conducted; it is therefore unclear if this intervention has lasting effects on memory.There are a loosely associated group of mnemonic principles and techniques that can be used to vastly improve memory known as the art of memory.The International Longevity Center released in  a report which includes in pages – recommendations for keeping the mind in good functionality until advanced age. Some of the recommendations are to stay intellectually active through learning training or reading to keep physically active so to promote blood circulation to the brain to socialize to reduce stress to keep sleep time regular to avoid depression or emotional instability and to observe good nutrition.Memorization is a method of learning that allows an individual to recall information verbatim. Rote learning is the method most often used. Methods of memorizing things have been the subject of much discussion over the years with some writers such as Cosmos Rossellius using visual alphabets. The spacing effect shows that an individual is more likely to remember a list of items when rehearsal is spaced over an extended period of time. In contrast to this is cramming: an intensive memorization in a short period of time. the spacing effect is exploited to improve memory in spaced repetition flashcard training. Also relevant is the Zeigarnik effect which states that people remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed ones. The so-called Method of loci uses spatial memory to memorize non-spatial information.Plants lack a specialized organ devoted to memory retention and so plant memory has been a controversial topic in recent years. New advances in the field have identified the presence of neurotransmitters in plants adding to the hypothesis that plants are capable of remembering. Action potentials a physiological response characteristic of neurons have been shown to have an influence on plants as well including in wound responses and photosynthesis. In addition to these homologous features of memory systems in both plants and animals plants have also been observed to encode store and retrieve basic short-term memories.One of the most well-studied plants to show rudimentary memory is the Venus flytrap. Native to the subtropical wetlands of the eastern United States Venus Fly Traps have evolved the ability to obtain meat for sustenance likely due to the lack of nitrogen in the soil. This is done by two trap-forming leaf tips that snap shut once triggered by a potential prey. On each lobe three triggers hairs await stimulation. In order to maximize the benefit to cost ratio the plant enables a rudimentary form of memory in which two trigger hairs must be stimulated within  seconds in order to result in trap closure. This system ensures that the trap only closes when potential prey is within grasp.The time lapse between trigger hair stimulations suggests that the plant can remember an initial stimulus long enough for a second stimulus to initiate trap closure. This memory isnt encoded in a brain as plants lack this specialized organ. Rather information is stored in the form of cytoplasmic calcium levels. The first trigger causes a subthreshold cytoplasmic calcium influx. This initial trigger isnt enough to activate trap closure and so a subsequent stimulus allows for a secondary influx of calcium. The latter calcium rise superimposes on the initial one creating an action potential that passes threshold resulting in trap closure. Researchers to prove that an electrical threshold must be met to stimulate trap closure excited a single trigger hair with a constant mechanical stimulus using Ag/AgCl electrodes. The trap closed after only a few seconds. This experiment gave evidence to demonstrate that the electrical threshold not necessarily the number of trigger hair stimulations was the contributing factor in Venus Fly Trap memory. It has been shown that trap closure can be blocked using uncouplers and inhibitors of voltage-gated channels. After trap closure these electrical signals stimulate glandular production of jasmonic acid and hydrolases allowing for digestion of the prey.The field of plant neurobiology has gained a large amount of interest over the past decade leading to an influx of research regarding plant memory. Although the Venus flytrap is one of the more highly studied many other plants exhibit the capacity to remember including the Mimosa pudica through an experiment conducted by Monica Gagliano and colleagues in . To study the Mimosa pudica Gagliano designed an appartus with which potted mimosa plants could be repeatedly dropped the same distance and at the same speed. It was observed that the plants defensive response of curling up its leaves decreased over the  times the experiment was repeated per plant. To confirm that this was a mechanism of memory rather than exhaustion some of the plants were shaken post experiment and displayed normal defensive responses of leaf curling. This experiment also demonstrated long term memory in the plants as it was repeated a month later and the plants were observed to remain unfazed by the dropping. As the field expands it is likely that we will learn more about the capacity of a plant to remember.Metaphysics is the branch of philosophy that examines the fundamental nature of reality including the relationship between mind and matter between substance and attribute and between potentiality and actuality. The word metaphysics comes from two Greek words that together literally mean after or behind or among the study of the natural. It has been suggested that the term might have been coined by a first century AD editor who assembled various small selections of Aristotle’s works into the treatise we now know by the name Metaphysics ta meta ta phusika after the Physics  another of Aristotles works.Metaphysics studies questions related to what it is for something to exist and what types of existence there are. Metaphysics seeks to answer in an abstract and fully general manner the questions:What is thereWhat is it likeTopics of metaphysical investigation include existence objects and their properties space and time cause and effect and possibility.Metaphysical study is conducted using deduction from that which is known a priori. Like foundational mathematics which is sometimes considered a special case of metaphysics applied to the existence of number it tries to give a coherent account of the structure of the world capable of explaining our everyday and scientific perception of the world and being free from contradictions. In mathematics there are many different ways to define numbers; similarly in metaphysics there are many different ways to define objects properties concepts and other entities which are claimed to make up the world. While metaphysics may as a special case study the entities postulated by fundamental science such as atoms and superstrings its core topic is the set of categories such as object property and causality which those scientific theories assume. For example: claiming that electrons have charge is a scientific theory; while exploring what it means for electrons to be or at least to be perceived as objects charge to be a property and for both to exist in a topological entity called space is the task of metaphysics.There are two broad stances about what is the world studied by metaphysics. The strong classical view assumes that the objects studied by metaphysics exist independently of any observer so that the subject is the most fundamental of all sciences. The weak modern view assumes that the objects studied by metaphysics exist inside the mind of an observer so the subject becomes a form of introspection and conceptual analysis. Some philosophers notably Kant discuss both of these worlds and what can be inferred about each one. Some such as the logical positivists and many scientists reject the strong view of metaphysics as meaningless and unverifiable. Others reply that this criticism also applies to any type of knowledge including hard science which claims to describe anything other than the contents of human perception and thus that the world of perception is the objective world in some sense. Metaphysics itself usually assumes that some stance has been taken on these questions and that it may proceed independently of the choice—the question of which stance to take belongs instead to another branch of philosophy epistemology.Ontology is the philosophical study of the nature of being becoming existence or reality as well as the basic categories of being and their relations.failed verification Traditionally listedby whom as the core of metaphysics ontology often deals with questions concerning what entities exist and how such entities may be grouped related within a hierarchy and subdivided according to similarities and differences.See also: Identity philosophy and Philosophy of space and timeIdentity is a fundamental metaphysical concern. Metaphysicians investigating identity are tasked with the question of what exactly it means for something to be identical to itself or – more controversially – to something else. Issues of identity arise in the context of time: what does it mean for something to be itself across two moments in time How do we account for this Another question of identity arises when we ask what our criteria ought to be for determining identity and how the reality of identity interfaces with linguistic expressions.The metaphysical positions one takes on identity have far-reaching implications on issues such as the Mind–body problem personal identity ethics and law.A few ancient Greeks took extreme positions on the nature of change. Parmenides denied change altogether while Heraclitus argued that change was ubiquitous: No man ever steps in the same river twice.Identity sometimes called numerical identity is the relation that a thing bears to itself and which no thing bears to anything other than itself cf. sameness.A modern philosopher who made a lasting impact on the philosophy of identity was Leibniz whose Law of the Indiscernibility of Identicals is still widely accepted today. It states that if some object x is identical to some object y then any property that x has y will have as well.Put formally it states{\displaystyle \forall x\;\forall y\;x=y\rightarrow \forall P\;Px\leftrightarrow Py}{\displaystyle \forall x\;\forall y\;x=y\rightarrow \forall P\;Px\leftrightarrow Py}However it does seem that objects can change over time. If one were to look at a tree one day and the tree later lost a leaf it would seem that one could still be looking at that same tree. Two rival theories to account for the relationship between change and identity are perdurantism which treats the tree as a series of tree-stages and endurantism which maintains that the organism—the same tree—is present at every stage in its history.By appealing to intrinsic and extrinsic properties endurantism finds a way to harmonize identity with change. Endurantists believe that objects persist by being strictly numerically identical over time. However if Leibnizs Law of the Indiscernibility of Identicals is utilized to define numerical identity here it seems that objects must be completely unchanged in order to persist. Discriminating between intrinsic properties and extrinsic properties endurantists state that numerical identity means that if some object x is identical to some object y then any intrinsic property that x has y will have as well. Thus if an object persists intrinsic properties of it are unchanged but extrinsic properties can change over time. Besides the object itself environments and other objects can change over time; properties that relate to other objects would change even if this object does not change.Perdurantism can harmonize identity with change in another way. In four-dimensionalism a version of perdurantism what persists is a four-dimensional object which does not change although three-dimensional slices of the object may differ.See also: Philosophy of space and timeObjects appear to us in space and time while abstract entities such as classes properties and relations do not. How do space and time serve this function as a ground for objects Are space and time entities themselves of some form Must they exist prior to objects How exactly can they be defined How is time related to change; must there always be something changing in order for time to existClassical philosophy recognized a number of causes including teleological future causes. In special relativity and quantum field theory the notions of space time and causality become tangled together with temporal orders of causations becoming dependent on who is observing them.citation needed The laws of physics are symmetrical in time so could equally well be used to describe time as running backwards. Why then do we perceive it as flowing in one direction the arrow of time and as containing causation flowing in the same directionFor that matter can an effect precede its cause This was the title of a  paper by Michael Dummett which sparked a discussion that continues today. Earlier in  C. S. Lewis had argued that one can meaningfully pray concerning the outcome of e.g. a medical test while recognizing that the outcome is determined by past events: My free act contributes to the cosmic shape. Likewise some interpretations of quantum mechanics dating to  involve backward-in-time causal influences.Causality is linked by many philosophers to the concept of counterfactuals. To say that A caused B means that if A had not happened then B would not have happened. This view was advanced by David Lewis in his  paper Causation. His subsequent papers further develop his theory of causation.Causality is usually required as a foundation for philosophy of science if science aims to understand causes and effects and make predictions about them.Metaphysicians investigate questions about the ways the world could have been. David Lewis in On the Plurality of Worlds endorsed a view called Concrete Modal realism according to which facts about how things could have been are made true by other concrete worlds in which things are different. Other philosophers including Gottfried Leibniz have dealt with the idea of possible worlds as well. A necessary fact is true across all possible worlds. A possible fact is true in some possible world even if not in the actual world. For example it is possible that cats could have had two tails or that any particular apple could have not existed. By contrast certain propositions seem necessarily true such as analytic propositions e.g. All bachelors are unmarried. The view that any analytic truth is necessary is not universally held among philosophers. A less controversial view is that self-identity is necessary as it seems fundamentally incoherent to claim that any x is not identical to itself; this is known as the law of identity a putative first principle. Similarly Aristotle describes the principle of non-contradiction:It is impossible that the same quality should both belong and not belong to the same thing ... This is the most certain of all principles ... Wherefore they who demonstrate refer to this as an ultimate opinion. For it is by nature the source of all the other axioms.Peripheral questionsWhat is central and peripheral to metaphysics has varied over time and schools; however contemporary analytic philosophy as taught in USA and UK universities generally regards the above as central and the following as applications or peripheral topics; or in some cases as distinct subjects which have grown out of and depend upon metaphysics:citation neededMetaphysical cosmology is the branch of metaphysics that deals with the world as the totality of all phenomena in space and time. Historically it formed a major part of the subject alongside Ontology though its role is more peripheral in contemporary philosophy. It has had a broad scope and in many cases was founded in religion. The ancient Greeks drew no distinction between this use and their model for the cosmos. However in modern times it addresses questions about the Universe which are beyond the scope of the physical sciences. It is distinguished from religious cosmology in that it approaches these questions using philosophical methods e.g. dialectics.Cosmogony deals specifically with the origin of the universe. Modern metaphysical cosmology and cosmogony try to address questions such as:What is the origin of the Universe What is its first cause Is its existence necessary see monism pantheism emanationism and creationismWhat are the ultimate material components of the Universe see mechanism dynamism hylomorphism atomismWhat is the ultimate reason for the existence of the Universe Does the cosmos have a purpose see teleologyDifferent approaches toward resolving the mind–body problemAccounting for the existence of mind in a world largely composed of matter is a metaphysical problem which is so large and important as to have become a specialized subject of study in its own right philosophy of mind.Substance dualism is a classical theory in which mind and body are essentially different with the mind having some of the attributes traditionally assigned to the soul and which creates an immediate conceptual puzzle about how the two interact. This form of substance dualism differs from the dualism of some eastern philosophical traditions like Nyāya which also posit a soul; for the soul under their view is ontologically distinct from the mind. Idealism postulates that material objects do not exist unless perceived and only as perceptions. Adherents of panpsychism a kind of property dualism hold that everything has a mental aspect but not that everything exists in a mind. Neutral monism postulates that existence consists of a single substance that in itself is neither mental nor physical but is capable of mental and physical aspects or attributes – thus it implies a dual-aspect theory. For the last century the dominant theories have been science-inspired including materialistic monism type identity theory token identity theory functionalism reductive physicalism nonreductive physicalism eliminative materialism anomalous monism property dualism epiphenomenalism and emergence.Determinism is the philosophical proposition that every event including human cognition decision and action is causally determined by an unbroken chain of prior occurrences. It holds that nothing happens that has not already been determined. The principal consequence of the deterministic claim is that it poses a challenge to the existence of free will.The problem of free will is the problem of whether rational agents exercise control over their own actions and decisions. Addressing this problem requires understanding the relation between freedom and causation and determining whether the laws of nature are causally deterministic. Some philosophers known as incompatibilists view determinism and free will as mutually exclusive. If they believe in determinism they will therefore believe free will to be an illusion a position known as Hard Determinism. Proponents range from Baruch Spinoza to Ted Honderich. Henri Bergson defended free will in his dissertation Time and Free Will from .Others labeled compatibilists or soft determinists believe that the two ideas can be reconciled coherently. Adherents of this view include Thomas Hobbes and many modern philosophers such as John Martin Fischer Gary Watson Harry Frankfurt and the like.Incompatibilists who accept free will but reject determinism are called libertarians a term not to be confused with the political sense. Robert Kane and Alvin Plantinga are modern defenders of this theory.The earliest type of classification of social construction traces back to Plato in his dialogue Phaedrus where he claims that the biological classification system seems to carve nature at the joints. In contrast later philosophers such as Michel Foucault and Jorge Luis Borges have challenged the capacity of natural and social classification. In his essay The Analytical Language of John Wilkins Borges makes us imagine a certain encyclopedia where the animals are divided into a those that belong to the emperor; b embalmed ones; c those that are trained;... and so forth in order to bring forward the ambiguity of natural and social kinds. According to metaphysics author Alyssa Ney: the reason all this is interesting is that there seems to be a metaphysical difference between the Borgesian system and Platos. The difference is not obvious but one classification attempts to carve entities up according to objective distinction while the other does not. According to Quine this notion is closely related to the notion of similarity.There are different ways to set up the notion of number in metaphysics theories. Platonist theories postulate number as a fundamental category itself. Others consider it to be a property of an entity called a group comprising other entities; or to be a relation held between several groups of entities such as the number four is the set of all sets of four things. Many of the debates around universals are applied to the study of number and are of particular importance due to its status as a foundation for the philosophy of mathematics and for mathematics itself.Although metaphysics as a philosophical enterprise is highly hypothetical it also has practical application in most other branches of philosophy science and now also information technology. Such areas generally assume some basic ontology such as a system of objects properties classes and space time as well as other metaphysical stances on topics such as causality and agency then build their own particular theories upon these.In science for example some theories are based on the ontological assumption of objects with properties such as electrons having charge while others may reject objects completely such as quantum field theories where spread-out electronness becomes a property of space time rather than an object.Social branches of philosophy such as philosophy of morality aesthetics and philosophy of religion which in turn give rise to practical subjects such as ethics politics law and art all require metaphysical foundations which may be considered as branches or applications of metaphysics. For example they may postulate the existence of basic entities such as value beauty and God. Then they use these postulates to make their own arguments about consequences resulting from them. When philosophers in these subjects make their foundations they are doing applied metaphysics and may draw upon its core topics and methods to guide them including ontology and other core and peripheral topics. As in science the foundations chosen will in turn depend on the underlying ontology used so philosophers in these subjects may have to dig right down to the ontological layer of metaphysics to find what is possible for their theories. For example a contradiction obtained in a theory of God or Beauty might be due to an assumption that it is an object rather than some other kind of ontological entity.Prior to the modern history of science scientific questions were addressed as a part of natural philosophy. Originally the term science Latin: scientia simply meant knowledge. The scientific method however transformed natural philosophy into an empirical activity deriving from experiment unlike the rest of philosophy. By the end of the th century it had begun to be called science to distinguish it from other branches of philosophy. Science and philosophy have been considered separated disciplines ever since. Thereafter metaphysics denoted philosophical enquiry of a non-empirical character into the nature of existence.Metaphysics continues asking why where science leaves off. For example any theory of fundamental physics is based on some set of axioms which may postulate the existence of entities such as atoms particles forces charges mass or fields. Stating such postulates is considered to be the end of a science theory. Metaphysics takes these postulates and explores what they mean as human concepts. For example do all theories of physics require the existence of space and time objects and properties Or can they be expressed using only objects or only properties Do the objects have to retain their identity over time or can they change If they change then are they still the same object Can theories be reformulated by converting properties or predicates such as red into entities such as redness or redness fields or processes there is some redding happening over there appears in some human languages in place of the use of properties. Is the distinction between objects and properties fundamental to the physical world or to our perception of itMuch recent work has been devoted to analyzing the role of metaphysics in scientific theorizing. Alexandre Koyré led this movement declaring in his book Metaphysics and Measurement It is not by following experiment but by outstripping experiment that the scientific mind makes progress. That metaphysical propositions can influence scientific theorizing is John Watkins most lasting contribution to philosophy. Since  he showed the ways in which some un-testable and hence according to Popperian ideas non-empirical propositions can nevertheless be influential in the development of properly testable and hence scientific theories. These profound results in applied elementary logic...represented an important corrective to positivist teachings about the meaninglessness of metaphysics and of normative claims. Imre Lakatos maintained that all scientific theories have a metaphysical hard core essential for the generation of hypotheses and theoretical assumptions. Thus according to Lakatos scientific changes are connected with vast cataclysmic metaphysical revolutions.An example from biology of Lakatos thesis: David Hull has argued that changes in the ontological status of the species concept have been central in the development of biological thought from Aristotle through Cuvier Lamarck and Darwin. Darwins ignorance of metaphysics made it more difficult for him to respond to his critics because he could not readily grasp the ways in which their underlying metaphysical views differed from his own.In physics new metaphysical ideas have arisen in connection with quantum mechanics where subatomic particles arguably do not have the same sort of individuality as the particulars with which philosophy has traditionally been concerned. Also adherence to a deterministic metaphysics in the face of the challenge posed by the quantum-mechanical uncertainty principle led physicists such as Albert Einstein to propose alternative theories that retained determinism. A.N. Whitehead is famous for creating a process philosophy metaphysics inspired by electromagnetism and special relativity.In chemistry Gilbert Newton Lewis addressed the nature of motion arguing that an electron should not be said to move when it has none of the properties of motion.Katherine Hawley notes that the metaphysics even of a widely accepted scientific theory may be challenged if it can be argued that the metaphysical presuppositions of the theory make no contribution to its predictive success.Metametaphysics is the branch of philosophy that is concerned with the foundations of metaphysics. A number of individuals have suggested that much or all of metaphysics should be rejected a metametaphysical position known as metaphysical deflationisma or ontological deflationism.In the th century Francis Bacon rejected scholastic metaphysics and argued strongly for what is now called empiricism being seen later as the father of modern empirical science. In the th century David Hume took a strong position arguing that all genuine knowledge involves either mathematics or matters of fact and that metaphysics which goes beyond these is worthless. He concludes his Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding with the statement:If we take in our hand any volume; of divinity or school metaphysics for instance; let us ask Does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number No. Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence No. Commit it then to the flames: for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion.Thirty-three years after Humes Enquiry appeared Immanuel Kant published his Critique of Pure Reason. Although he followed Hume in rejecting much of previous metaphysics he argued that there was still room for some synthetic a priori knowledge concerned with matters of fact yet obtainable independent of experience. These included fundamental structures of space time and causality. He also argued for the freedom of the will and the existence of things in themselves the ultimate but unknowable objects of experience.Wittgenstein introduced the concept that metaphysics could be influenced by theories of aesthetics via logic vis. a world composed of atomical facts.In the s A.J. Ayer and Rudolf Carnap endorsed Humes position; Carnap quoted the passage above. They argued that metaphysical statements are neither true nor false but meaningless since according to their verifiability theory of meaning a statement is meaningful only if there can be empirical evidence for or against it. Thus while Ayer rejected the monism of Spinoza he avoided a commitment to pluralism the contrary position by holding both views to be without meaning. Carnap took a similar line with the controversy over the reality of the external world. While the logical positivism movement is now considered dead with Ayer a major proponent admitting in a  TV interview that nearly all of it was false it has continued to influence philosophy development.Arguing against such rejections the Scholastic philosopher Edward Feser held that Humes critique of metaphysics and specifically Humes fork is notoriously self-refuting. Feser argues that Humes fork itself is not a conceptual truth and is not empirically testable.Some living philosophers such as Amie Thomasson have argued that many metaphysical questions can be dissolved just by looking at the way we use words; others such as Ted Sider have argued that metaphysical questions are substantive and that we can make progress toward answering them by comparing theories according to a range of theoretical virtues inspired by the sciences such as simplicity and explanatory power.EtymologyThe word metaphysics derives from the Greek words μετά metá after and φυσικά physiká physics. It was first used as the title for several of Aristotles works because they were usually anthologized after the works on physics in complete editions. The prefix meta- after indicates that these works come after the chapters on physics. However Aristotle himself did not call the subject of these books metaphysics: he referred to it as first philosophy Greek: πρώτη φιλοσοφία; Latin: philosophia prima. The editor of Aristotles works Andronicus of Rhodes is thought to have placed the books on first philosophy right after another work Physics and called them τὰ μετὰ τὰ φυσικὰ βιβλία tà metà tà physikà biblía or the books that come after the books on physics.However once the name was given the commentators sought to find other reasons for its appropriateness. For instance Thomas Aquinas understood it to refer to the chronological or pedagogical order among our philosophical studies so that the metaphysical sciences would mean those that we study after having mastered the sciences that deal with the physical world.The term was misread by other medieval commentators who thought it meant the science of what is beyond the physical. Following this tradition the prefix meta- has more recently been prefixed to the names of sciences to designate higher sciences dealing with ulterior and more fundamental problems: hence metamathematics metaphysiology etc.A person who creates or develops metaphysical theories is called a metaphysician.Common parlance also uses the word metaphysics for a different referent from that of the present article namely for beliefs in arbitrary non-physical or magical entities. For example Metaphysical healing to refer to healing by means of remedies that are magical rather than scientific. This usage stemmed from the various historical schools of speculative metaphysics which operated by postulating all manner of physical mental and spiritual entities as bases for particular metaphysical systems. Metaphysics as a subject does not preclude beliefs in such magical entities but neither does it promote them. Rather it is the subject which provides the vocabulary and logic with which such beliefs might be analyzed and studied for example to search for inconsistencies both within themselves and with other accepted systems such as Science.Cognitive archeology such as analysis of cave paintings and other pre-historic art and customs suggests that a form of perennial philosophy or Shamanic metaphysics may stretch back to the birth of behavioral modernity all around the world. Similar beliefs are found in present-day stone age cultures such as Australian aboriginals. Perennial philosophy postulates the existence of a spirit or concept world alongside the day-to-day world and interactions between these worlds during dreaming and ritual or on special days or at special places. It has been argued that perennial philosophy formed the basis for Platonism with Plato articulating rather than creating much older widespread beliefs.Bronze Age cultures such as ancient Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt along with similarly structured but chronologically later cultures such as Mayans and Aztecs developed belief systems based on mythology anthropomorphic gods mind–body dualism and a spirit world to explain causes and cosmology. These cultures appear to have been interested in astronomy and may have associated or identified the stars with some of these entities. In ancient Egypt the ontological distinction between order maat and chaos Isfet seems to have been important.The circled dot was used by the Pythagoreans and later Greeks to represent the first metaphysical being the Monad or The Absolute.The first named Greek philosopher according to Aristotle is Thales of Miletus early th century BCE. He made use of purely physical explanations to explain the phenomena of the world rather than the mythological and divine explanations of tradition. He is thought to have posited water as the single underlying principle or Arche in later Aristotelian terminology of the material world. His fellow but younger Miletians Anaximander and Anaximenes also posited monistic underlying principles namely apeiron the indefinite or boundless and air respectively.Another school was the Eleatics in southern Italy. The group was founded in the early fifth century BCE by Parmenides and included Zeno of Elea and Melissus of Samos. Methodologically the Eleatics were broadly rationalist and took logical standards of clarity and necessity to be the criteria of truth. Parmenides chief doctrine was that reality is a single unchanging and universal Being. Zeno used reductio ad absurdum to demonstrate the illusory nature of change and time in his paradoxes.Heraclitus of Ephesus in contrast made change central teaching that all things flow. His philosophy expressed in brief aphorisms is quite cryptic. For instance he also taught the unity of opposites.Democritus and his teacher Leucippus are known for formulating an atomic theory for the cosmos. They are considered forerunners of the scientific method.The modern yin and yang symbol taijituMetaphysics in Chinese philosophy can be traced back to the earliest Chinese philosophical concepts from the Zhou Dynasty such as Tian Heaven and Yin and Yang. The fourth century BCE saw a turn towards cosmogony with the rise of Taoism in the Daodejing and Zhuangzi and sees the natural world as dynamic and constantly changing processes which spontaneously arise from a single immanent metaphysical source or principle Tao. Another philosophical school which arose around this time was the School of Naturalists which saw the ultimate metaphysical principle as the Taiji the supreme polarity composed of the forces of Yin and Yang which were always in a state of change seeking balance. Another concern of Chinese metaphysics especially Taoism is the relationship and nature of Being and non-Being you 有 and wu 無. The Taoists held that the ultimate the Tao was also non-being or no-presence. Other important concepts were those of spontaneous generation or natural vitality Ziran and correlative resonance Ganying.After the fall of the Han Dynasty  CE China saw the rise of the Neo-Taoist Xuanxue school. This school was very influential in developing the concepts of later Chinese metaphysics. Buddhist philosophy entered China c. st century and was influenced by the native Chinese metaphysical concepts to develop new theories. The native Tiantai and Huayen schools of philosophy maintained and reinterpreted the Indian theories of shunyata emptiness kong 空 and Buddha-nature Fo xing 佛性 into the theory of interpenetration of phenomena. Neo-Confucians like Zhang Zai under the influence of other schools developed the concepts of principle li and vital energy qi.Socrates is known for his dialectic or questioning approach to philosophy rather than a positive metaphysical doctrine.His pupil Plato is famous for his theory of forms which he places in the mouth of Socrates in his dialogues. Platonic realism also considered a form of idealism is considered to be a solution to the problem of universals; i.e. what particular objects have in common is that they share a specific Form which is universal to all others of their respective kind.The theory has a number of other aspects:Epistemological: knowledge of the Forms is more certain than mere sensory data.Ethical: The Form of the Good sets an objective standard for morality.Time and Change: The world of the Forms is eternal and unchanging. Time and change belong only to the lower sensory world. Time is a moving image of Eternity.Abstract objects and mathematics: Numbers geometrical figures etc. exist mind-independently in the World of Forms.Platonism developed into Neoplatonism a philosophy with a monotheistic and mystical flavour that survived well into the early Christian era.Platos pupil Aristotle wrote widely on almost every subject including metaphysics. His solution to the problem of universals contrasts with Platos. Whereas Platonic Forms are existentially apparent in the visible world Aristotelian essences dwell in particulars.Potentiality and Actuality are principles of a dichotomy which Aristotle used throughout his philosophical works to analyze motion causality and other issues.The Aristotelian theory of change and causality stretches to four causes: the material formal efficient and final. The efficient cause corresponds to what is now known as a cause simplicity. Final causes are explicitly teleological a concept now regarded as controversial in science. The Matter/Form dichotomy was to become highly influential in later philosophy as the substance/essence distinction.The opening arguments in Aristotles Metaphysics Book I revolve around the senses knowledge experience theory and wisdom. The first main focus in the Metaphysics is attempting to determine how intellect advances from sensation through memory experience and art to theoretical knowledge. Aristotle claims that eyesight provides us with the capability to recognize and remember experiences while sound allows us to learn.Sāṃkhya is an ancient system of Indian philosophy based on a dualism involving the ultimate principles of consciousness and matter. It is described as the rationalist school of Indian philosophy. It is most related to the Yoga school of Hinduism and its method was most influential on the development of Early Buddhism.The Sāmkhya is an enumerationist philosophy whose epistemology accepts three of six pramanas proofs as the only reliable means of gaining knowledge. These include pratyakṣa perception anumāṇa inference and śabda āptavacana word/testimony of reliable sources.Samkhya is strongly dualist. Sāmkhya philosophy regards the universe as consisting of two realities; puruṣa consciousness and prakṛti matter. Jiva a living being is that state in which puruṣa is bonded to prakṛti in some form. This fusion state the Samkhya scholars led to the emergence of buddhi spiritual awareness and ahaṅkāra ego consciousness. The universe is described by this school as one created by purusa-prakṛti entities infused with various permutations and combinations of variously enumerated elements senses feelings activity and mind. During the state of imbalance one of more constituents overwhelm the others creating a form of bondage particularly of the mind. The end of this imbalance bondage is called liberation or moksha by the Samkhya school.The existence of God or supreme being is not directly asserted nor considered relevant by the Samkhya philosophers. Sāṃkhya denies the final cause of Ishvara God. While the Samkhya school considers the Vedas as a reliable source of knowledge it is an atheistic philosophy according to Paul Deussen and other scholars. A key difference between Samkhya and Yoga schools state scholars is that Yoga school accepts a personal yet essentially inactive deity or personal god.Samkhya is known for its theory of guṇas qualities innate tendencies. Guṇa it states are of three types: sattva being good compassionate illuminating positive and constructive; rajas is one of activity chaotic passion impulsive potentially good or bad; and tamas being the quality of darkness ignorance destructive lethargic negative. Everything all life forms and human beings state Samkhya scholars have these three guṇas but in different proportions. The interplay of these guṇas defines the character of someone or something of nature and determines the progress of life. The Samkhya theory of guṇas was widely discussed developed and refined by various schools of Indian philosophies including Buddhism. Samkhyas philosophical treatises also influenced the development of various theories of Hindu ethics.Realization of the nature of Self-identity is the principal object of the Vedanta system of Indian metaphysics. In the Upanishads self-consciousness is not the first-person indexical self-awareness or the self-awareness which is self-reference without identification and also not the self-consciousness which as a kind of desire is satisfied by another self-consciousness. It is Self-realisation; the realisation of the Self consisting of consciousness that leads all else.The word Self-consciousness in the Upanishads means the knowledge about the existence and nature of Brahman. It means the consciousness of our own real being the primary reality. Self-consciousness means Self-knowledge the knowledge of Prajna i.e. of Prana which is Brahman. According to the Upanishads the Atman or Paramatman is phenomenally unknowable; it is the object of realisation. The Atman is unknowable in its essential nature; it is unknowable in its essential nature because it is the eternal subject who knows about everything including itself. The Atman is the knower and also the known.Metaphysicians regard the Self either to be distinct from the Absolute or entirely identical with the Absolute. They have given form to three schools of thought – a the Dualistic school b the Quasi-dualistic school and c the Monistic school as the result of their varying mystical experiences. Prakrti and Atman when treated as two separate and distinct aspects form the basis of the Dualism of the Shvetashvatara Upanishad. Quasi-dualism is reflected in the Vaishnavite-monotheism of Ramanuja and the absolute Monism in the teachings of Adi Shankara.Self-consciousness is the Fourth state of consciousness or Turiya the first three being Vaisvanara Taijasa and Prajna. These are the four states of individual consciousness.There are three distinct stages leading to Self-realisation. The First stage is in mystically apprehending the glory of the Self within us as though we were distinct from it. The Second stage is in identifying the I-within with the Self that we are in essential nature entirely identical with the pure Self. The Third stage is in realising that the Atman is Brahman that there is no difference between the Self and the Absolute. The Fourth stage is in realising I am the Absolute – Aham Brahman Asmi. The Fifth stage is in realising that Brahman is the All that exists as also that which does not exist.In Buddhist philosophy there are various metaphysical traditions that have proposed different questions about the nature of reality based on the teachings of the Buddha in the early Buddhist texts. The Buddha of the early texts does not focus on metaphysical questions but on ethical and spiritual training and in some cases he dismisses certain metaphysical questions as unhelpful and indeterminate Avyakta which he recommends should be set aside. The development of systematic metaphysics arose after the Buddhas death with the rise of the Abhidharma traditions. The Buddhist Abhidharma schools developed their analysis of reality based on the concept of dharmas which are the ultimate physical and mental events that make up experience and their relations to each other. Noa Ronkin has called their approach phenomenological.Later philosophical traditions include the Madhyamika school of Nagarjuna which further developed the theory of the emptiness shunyata of all phenomena or dharmas which rejects any kind of substance. This has been interpreted as a form of anti-foundationalism and anti-realism which sees reality as having no ultimate essence or ground. The Yogacara school meanwhile promoted a theory called awareness only vijnapti-matra which has been interpreted as a form of Idealism or Phenomenology and denies the split between awareness itself and the objects of awareness.Major ideas in Sufi metaphysics have surrounded the concept of weḥdah وحدة meaning unity or in Arabic توحيد tawhid. waḥdat al-wujūd literally means the Unity of Existence or Unity of Being. The phrase has been translated pantheism. Wujud i.e. existence or presence here refers to Allahs wujud compare tawhid. On the other hand waḥdat ash-shuhūd meaning Apparentism or Monotheism of Witness holds that God and his creation are entirely separate.Between about  and  philosophy as a discipline took place as part of the Catholic churchs teaching system known as scholasticism. Scholastic philosophy took place within an established framework blending Christian theology with Aristotelian teachings. Although fundamental orthodoxies were not commonly challenged there were nonetheless deep metaphysical disagreements particularly over the problem of universals which engaged Duns Scotus and Pierre Abelard. William of Ockham is remembered for his principle of ontological parsimony.In the early modern period th and th centuries the system-building scope of philosophy is often linked to the rationalist method of philosophy that is the technique of deducing the nature of the world by pure reason. The scholastic concepts of substance and accident were employed.Leibniz proposed in his Monadology a plurality of non-interacting substances.Descartes is famous for his dualism of material and mental substances.Spinoza believed reality was a single substance of God-or-nature.WolffChristian Wolff had theoretical philosophy divided into an ontology or philosophia prima as a general metaphysics which arises as a preliminary to the distinction of the three special metaphysics on the soul world and God: rational psychology rational cosmology and rational theology. The three disciplines are called empirical and rational because they are independent of revelation. This scheme which is the counterpart of religious tripartition in creature creation and Creator is best known to philosophical students by Kants treatment of it in the Critique of Pure Reason. In the Preface of the nd edition of Kants book Wolff is defined the greatest of all dogmatic philosophers.British empiricism marked something of a reaction to rationalist and system-building metaphysics or speculative metaphysics as it was pejoratively termed. The skeptic David Hume famously declared that most metaphysics should be consigned to the flames see below. Hume was notorious among his contemporaries as one of the first philosophers to openly doubt religion but is better known now for his critique of causality. John Stuart Mill Thomas Reid and John Locke were less skeptical embracing a more cautious style of metaphysics based on realism common sense and science. Other philosophers notably George Berkeley were led from empiricism to idealistic metaphysics.Immanuel Kant attempted a grand synthesis and revision of the trends already mentioned: scholastic philosophy systematic metaphysics and skeptical empiricism not to forget the burgeoning science of his day. As did the systems builders he had an overarching framework in which all questions were to be addressed. Like Hume who famously woke him from his dogmatic slumbers he was suspicious of metaphysical speculation and also places much emphasis on the limitations of the human mind. Kant described his shift in metaphysics away from making claims about an objective noumenal world towards exploring the subjective phenomenal world as a Copernican Revolution by analogy to though opposite in direction to Copernicus shift from man the subject to the sun an object at the center of the universe.Kant saw rationalist philosophers as aiming for a kind of metaphysical knowledge he defined as the synthetic apriori—that is knowledge that does not come from the senses it is a priori but is nonetheless about reality synthetic. Inasmuch as it is about reality it differs from abstract mathematical propositions which he terms analytical apriori and being apriori it is distinct from empirical scientific knowledge which he terms synthetic aposteriori. The only synthetic apriori knowledge we can have is of how our minds organise the data of the senses; that organising framework is space and time which for Kant have no mind-independent existence but nonetheless operate uniformly in all humans. Apriori knowledge of space and time is all that remains of metaphysics as traditionally conceived. There is a reality beyond sensory data or phenomena which he calls the realm of noumena; however we cannot know it as it is in itself but only as it appears to us. He allows himself to speculate that the origins of phenomenal God morality and free will might exist in the noumenal realm but these possibilities have to be set against its basic unknowability for humans. Although he saw himself as having disposed of metaphysics in a sense he has generally been regarded in retrospect as having a metaphysics of his own and as beginning the modern analytical conception of the subject.Nineteenth century philosophy was overwhelmingly influenced by Kant and his successors. Schopenhauer Schelling Fichte and Hegel all purveyed their own panoramic versions of German Idealism Kants own caution about metaphysical speculation and refutation of idealism having fallen by the wayside. The idealistic impulse continued into the early twentieth century with British idealists such as F.H. Bradley and J.M.E. McTaggart. Followers of Karl Marx took Hegels dialectic view of history and re-fashioned it as materialism.Early analytic philosophy and positivismDuring the period when idealism was dominant in philosophy science had been making great advances. The arrival of a new generation of scientifically minded philosophers led to a sharp decline in the popularity of idealism during the s.Analytic philosophy was spearheaded by Bertrand Russell and G.E. Moore. Russell and William James tried to compromise between idealism and materialism with the theory of neutral monism.The early to mid twentieth century philosophy saw a trend to reject metaphysical questions as meaningless. The driving force behind this tendency was the philosophy of logical positivism as espoused by the Vienna Circle which argued that the meaning of a statement was its prediction of observable results of an experiment and thus that there is no need to postulate the existence of any objects other than these perceptual observations.At around the same time the American pragmatists were steering a middle course between materialism and idealism. System-building metaphysics with a fresh inspiration from science was revived by A.N. Whitehead and Charles Hartshorne.The forces that shaped analytic philosophy—the break with idealism and the influence of science—were much less significant outside the English speaking world although there was a shared turn toward language. Continental philosophy continued in a trajectory from post Kantianism.The phenomenology of Husserl and others was intended as a collaborative project for the investigation of the features and structure of consciousness common to all humans in line with Kants basing his synthetic apriori on the uniform operation of consciousness. It was officially neutral with regards to ontology but was nonetheless to spawn a number of metaphysical systems. Brentanos concept of intentionality would become widely influential including on analytic philosophy.Heidegger author of Being and Time saw himself as re-focusing on Being-qua-being introducing the novel concept of Dasein in the process. Classing himself an existentialist Sartre wrote an extensive study of Being and Nothingness.The speculative realism movement marks a return to full blooded realism.There are two fundamental aspects of everyday experience: change and persistence. Until recently the Western philosophical tradition has arguably championed substance and persistence with some notable exceptions however. According to process thinkers novelty flux and accident do matter and sometimes they constitute the ultimate reality.In a broad sense process metaphysics is as old as Western philosophy with figures such as Heraclitus Plotinus Duns Scotus Leibniz David Hume Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling Gustav Theodor Fechner Friedrich Adolf Trendelenburg Charles Renouvier Karl Marx Ernst Mach Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche Émile Boutroux Henri Bergson Samuel Alexander and Nicolas Berdyaev. It seemingly remains an open question whether major Continental figures such as the late Martin Heidegger Maurice Merleau-Ponty Gilles Deleuze Michel Foucault or Jacques Derrida should be included.In a strict sense process metaphysics may be limited to the works of a few founding fathers: G.W.F. Hegel Charles Sanders Peirce William James Henri Bergson A.N. Whitehead and John Dewey. From a European perspective there was a very significant and early Whiteheadian influence on the works of outstanding scholars such as Émile Meyerson – Louis Couturat – Jean Wahl – Robin George Collingwood – Philippe Devaux – Hans Jonas – Dorothy M. Emmett – Maurice Merleau Ponty – Enzo Paci – Charlie Dunbar Broad – Wolfe Mays – Ilya Prigogine – Jules Vuillemin – Jean Ladrière – Gilles Deleuze – Wolfhart Pannenberg – and Reiner Wiehl –.While early analytic philosophy tended to reject metaphysical theorizing under the influence of logical positivism it was revived in the second half of the twentieth century. Philosophers such as David K. Lewis and David Armstrong developed elaborate theories on a range of topics such as universals causation possibility and necessity and abstract objects. However the focus of analytic philosophy generally is away from the construction of all-encompassing systems and toward close analysis of individual ideas.Among the developments that led to the revival of metaphysical theorizing were Quines attack on the analytic–synthetic distinction which was generally taken to undermine Carnaps distinction between existence questions internal to a framework and those external to it.The philosophy of fiction the problem of empty names and the debate over existences status as a property have all come of relative obscurity into the limelight while perennial issues such as free will possible worlds and the philosophy of time have had new life breathed into them.The analytic view is of metaphysics as studying phenomenal human concepts rather than making claims about the noumenal world so its style often blurs into philosophy of language and introspective psychology. Compared to system-building it can seem very dry stylistically similar to computer programming mathematics or even accountancy as a common stated goal is to account for entities in the world.citation neededModern philosophy is philosophy developed in the modern era and associated with modernity. It is not a specific doctrine or school and thus should not be confused with Modernism although there are certain assumptions common to much of it which helps to distinguish it from earlier philosophy.The th and early th centuries roughly mark the beginning and the end of modern philosophy. How much of the Renaissance should be included is a matter for dispute; likewise modernity may or may not have ended in the twentieth century and been replaced by postmodernity. How one decides these questions will determine the scope of ones use of the term modern philosophy.How much of Renaissance intellectual history is part of modern philosophy is disputed: the Early Renaissance is often considered less modern and more medieval compared to the later High Renaissance. By the th and th centuries the major figures in philosophy of mind epistemology and metaphysics were roughly divided into two main groups. The Rationalists mostly in France and Germany argued all knowledge must begin from certain innate ideas in the mind. Major rationalists were Descartes Baruch Spinoza Gottfried Leibniz and Nicolas Malebranche. The Empiricists by contrast held that knowledge must begin with sensory experience. Major figures in this line of thought are John Locke George Berkeley and David Hume These are retrospective categories for which Kant is largely responsible. Ethics and political philosophy are usually not subsumed under these categories though all these philosophers worked in ethics in their own distinctive styles. Other important figures in political philosophy include Thomas Hobbes and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.In the late eighteenth century Immanuel Kant set forth a groundbreaking philosophical system which claimed to bring unity to rationalism and empiricism. Whether or not he was right he did not entirely succeed in ending philosophical dispute. Kant sparked a storm of philosophical work in Germany in the early nineteenth century beginning with German idealism. The characteristic theme of idealism was that the world and the mind equally must be understood according to the same categories; it culminated in the work of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel who among many other things said that The real is rational; the rational is real.Hegels work was carried in many directions by his followers and critics. Karl Marx appropriated both Hegels philosophy of history and the empirical ethics dominant in Britain transforming Hegels ideas into a strictly materialist form setting the grounds for the development of a science of society. Søren Kierkegaard in contrast dismissed all systematic philosophy as an inadequate guide to life and meaning. For Kierkegaard life is meant to be lived not a mystery to be solved. Arthur Schopenhauer took idealism to the conclusion that the world was nothing but the futile endless interplay of images and desires and advocated atheism and pessimism. Schopenhauers ideas were taken up and transformed by Nietzsche who seized upon their various dismissals of the world to proclaim God is dead and to reject all systematic philosophy and all striving for a fixed truth transcending the individual. Nietzsche found in this not grounds for pessimism but the possibility of a new kind of freedom.th-century British philosophy came increasingly to be dominated by strands of neo-Hegelian thought and as a reaction against this figures such as Bertrand Russell and George Edward Moore began moving in the direction of analytic philosophy which was essentially an updating of traditional empiricism to accommodate the new developments in logic of the German mathematician Gottlob Frege.Renaissance humanism emphasized the value of human beings see Oration on the Dignity of Man and opposed dogma and scholasticism. This new interest in human activities led to the development of political science with The Prince of Niccolò Machiavelli. Humanists differed from Medieval scholars also because they saw the natural world as mathematically ordered and pluralistic instead of thinking of it in terms of purposes and goals. Renaissance philosophy is perhaps best explained by two propositions made by Leonardo da Vinci in his notebooks:All of our knowledge has its origins in our perceptionsThere is no certainty where one can neither apply any of the mathematical sciences nor any of those which are based upon the mathematical sciences.In a similar way Galileo Galilei based his scientific method on experiments but also developed mathematical methods for application to problems in physics. These two ways to conceive human knowledge formed the background for the principle of Empiricism and Rationalism respectively.Modern philosophy traditionally begins with René Descartes and his dictum I think therefore I am. In the early seventeenth century the bulk of philosophy was dominated by Scholasticism written by theologians and drawing upon Plato Aristotle and early Church writings. Descartes argued that many predominant Scholastic metaphysical doctrines were meaningless or false. In short he proposed to begin philosophy from scratch. In his most important work Meditations on First Philosophy he attempts just this over six brief essays. He tries to set aside as much as he possibly can of all his beliefs to determine what if anything he knows for certain. He finds that he can doubt nearly everything: the reality of physical objects God his memories history science even mathematics but he cannot doubt that he is in fact doubting. He knows what he is thinking about even if it is not true and he knows that he is there thinking about it. From this basis he builds his knowledge back up again. He finds that some of the ideas he has could not have originated from him alone but only from God; he proves that God exists. He then demonstrates that God would not allow him to be systematically deceived about everything; in essence he vindicates ordinary methods of science and reasoning as fallible but not false.Empiricism is a theory of knowledge which opposes other theories of knowledge such as rationalism idealism and historicism. Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes only or primarily via sensory experience as opposed to rationalism which asserts that knowledge comes also from pure thinking. Both empiricism and rationalism are individualist theories of knowledge whereas historicism is a social epistemology. While historicism also acknowledges the role of experience it differs from empiricism by assuming that sensory data cannot be understood without considering the historical and cultural circumstances in which observations are made. Empiricism should not be mixed up with empirical research because different epistemologies should be considered competing views on how best to do studies and there is near consensus among researchers that studies should be empirical. Today empiricism should therefore be understood as one among competing ideals of getting knowledge or how to do studies. As such empiricism is first and foremost characterized by the ideal to let observational data speak for themselves while the competing views are opposed to this ideal. The term empiricism should thus not just be understood in relation to how this term has been used in the history of philosophy. It should also be constructed in a way which makes it possible to distinguish empiricism among other epistemological positions in contemporary science and scholarship. In other words: Empiricism as a concept has to be constructed along with other concepts which together make it possible to make important discriminations between different ideals underlying contemporary science.Empiricism is one of several competing views that predominate in the study of human knowledge known as epistemology. Empiricism emphasizes the role of experience and evidence especially sensory perception in the formation of ideas over the notion of innate ideas or tradition in contrast to for example rationalism which relies upon reason and can incorporate innate knowledge.Political philosophy is the study of such topics as politics liberty justice property rights law and the enforcement of a legal code by authority: what they are why or even if they are needed what if anything makes a government legitimate what rights and freedoms it should protect and why what form it should take and why what the law is and what duties citizens owe to a legitimate government if any and when it may be legitimately overthrown—if ever. In a vernacular sense the term political philosophy often refers to a general view or specific ethic political belief or attitude about politics that does not necessarily belong to the technical discipline of philosophy.Idealism refers to the group of philosophies which assert that reality or reality as we can know it is fundamentally a construct of the mind or otherwise immaterial. Epistemologically idealism manifests as a skepticism about the possibility of knowing any mind-independent thing. In a sociological sense idealism emphasizes how human ideas—especially beliefs and values—shape society. As an ontological doctrine idealism goes further asserting that all entities are composed of mind or spirit. Idealism thus rejects physicalist and dualist theories that fail to ascribe priority to the mind. An extreme version of this idealism can exist in the philosophical notion of solipsism.Existentialism is generally considered to be the philosophical and cultural movement which holds that the starting point of philosophical thinking must be the individual and the experiences of the individual. Building on that existentialists hold that moral thinking and scientific thinking together do not suffice to understand human existence and therefore a further set of categories governed by the norm of authenticity is necessary to understand human existence.Phenomenology is the study of the structure of experience. It is a broad philosophical movement founded in the early years of the th century by Edmund Husserl expanded upon by a circle of his followers at the universities of Göttingen and Munich in Germany. The philosophy then spread to France the United States and elsewhere often in contexts far removed from Husserls early work.Pragmatism is a philosophical tradition centered on the linking of practice and theory. It describes a process where theory is extracted from practice and applied back to practice to form what is called intelligent practice.citation needed Important positions characteristic of pragmatism include instrumentalism radical empiricism verificationism conceptual relativity and fallibilism.citation needed There is general consensus among pragmatists that philosophy should take the methods and insights of modern science into account. Charles Sanders Peirce and his pragmatic maxim deserves most of the credit for pragmatism along with later twentieth century contributors William James and John Dewey.Analytic philosophy came to dominate English-speaking countries in the th century. In the United States United Kingdom Canada Scandinavia Australia and New Zealand the overwhelming majority of university philosophy departments identify themselves as analytic departments. The term generally refers to a broad philosophical tradition characterized by an emphasis on clarity and argument often achieved via modern formal logic and analysis of language and a respect for the natural sciences.Various philosophical movements in Asia arose in the modern period including:Liberty Enlightening the World known as the Statue of Liberty was donated to the US by France in  as an artistic personification of liberty.Broadly speaking liberty is the ability to do as one pleases. It is a synonym for the word freedom. In modern politics liberty is the state of being free within society from oppressive restrictions imposed by authority on ones way of life behaviour or political views. In philosophy liberty involves free will as contrasted with determinism. In theology liberty is freedom from the effects of sin spiritual servitude or worldly ties. Sometimes liberty is differentiated from freedom by using the word freedom primarily if not exclusively to mean the ability to do as one wills and what one has the power to do; and using the word liberty to mean the absence of arbitrary restraints taking into account the rights of all involved. In this sense the exercise of liberty is subject to capability and limited by the rights of others. Thus liberty entails the responsible use of freedom under the rule of law without depriving anyone else of their freedom. Freedom is more broad in that it represents a total lack of restraint or the unrestrained ability to fulfill ones desires. For example a person can have the freedom to murder but not have the liberty to murder as the latter example deprives others of their right not to be harmed. Liberty can be taken away as a form of punishment. In many countries people can be deprived of their liberty if they are convicted of criminal acts.The word liberty is often used in slogans such as life liberty and the pursuit of happiness or Liberty Equality Fraternity.Liberty originates from the Latin word libertas derived from the name of the goddess Libertas who along with the Goddess of Liberty usually portrays the concept and the archaic Roman god Liber.Philosophers from earliest times have considered the question of liberty. Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius – AD wrote:a polity in which there is the same law for all a polity administered with regard to equal rights and equal freedom of speech and the idea of a kingly government which respects most of all the freedom of the governed.a free man is he that in those things which by his strength and wit he is able to do is not hindered to do what he hath the will to do.John Locke – rejected that definition of liberty. While not specifically mentioning Hobbes he attacks Sir Robert Filmer who had the same definition. According to Locke:In the state of nature liberty consists of being free from any superior power on Earth. People are not under the will or lawmaking authority of others but have only the law of nature for their rule. In political society liberty consists of being under no other lawmaking power except that established by consent in the commonwealth. People are free from the dominion of any will or legal restraint apart from that enacted by their own constituted lawmaking power according to the trust put in it. Thus freedom is not as Sir Robert Filmer defines it: A liberty for everyone to do what he likes to live as he pleases and not to be tied by any laws. Freedom is constrained by laws in both the state of nature and political society. Freedom of nature is to be under no other restraint but the law of nature. Freedom of people under government is to be under no restraint apart from standing rules to live by that are common to everyone in the society and made by the lawmaking power established in it. Persons have a right or liberty to  follow their own will in all things that the law has not prohibited and  not be subject to the inconstant uncertain unknown and arbitrary wills of others.John Stuart Mill – in his work On Liberty was the first to recognize the difference between liberty as the freedom to act and liberty as the absence of coercion.In his book Two Concepts of Liberty Isaiah Berlin formally framed the differences between two perspectives as the distinction between two opposite concepts of liberty: positive liberty and negative liberty. The latter designates a negative condition in which an individual is protected from tyranny and the arbitrary exercise of authority while the former refers to the liberty that comes from self-mastery the freedom from inner compulsions such as weakness and fear.The Magna Carta originally known as the Charter of Liberties of  written in iron gall ink on parchment in medieval Latin using standard abbreviations of the period. This document is held at the British Library and is identified as British Library Cotton MS Augustus II..HistoryA romanticised th-century recreation of King John signing the Magna Carta. The charter would have been sealed rather than signed.The modern concept of political liberty has its origins in the Greek concepts of freedom and slavery. To be free to the Greeks was not to have a master to be independent from a master to live as one likes. That was the original Greek concept of freedom. It is closely linked with the concept of democracy as Aristotle put it:This then is one note of liberty which all democrats affirm to be the principle of their state. Another is that a man should live as he likes. This they say is the privilege of a freeman since on the other hand not to live as a man likes is the mark of a slave. This is the second characteristic of democracy whence has arisen the claim of men to be ruled by none if possible or if this is impossible to rule and be ruled in turns; and so it contributes to the freedom based upon equality.This applied only to free men. In Athens for instance women could not vote or hold office and were legally and socially dependent on a male relative.The populations of the Persian Empire enjoyed some degree of freedom. Citizens of all religions and ethnic groups were given the same rights and had the same freedom of religion women had the same rights as men and slavery was abolished  BC. All the palaces of the kings of Persia were built by paid workers in an era when slaves typically did such work.In the Maurya Empire of ancient India citizens of all religions and ethnic groups had some rights to freedom tolerance and equality. The need for tolerance on an egalitarian basis can be found in the Edicts of Ashoka the Great which emphasize the importance of tolerance in public policy by the government. The slaughter or capture of prisoners of war also appears to have been condemned by Ashoka. Slavery also appears to have been non-existent in the Maurya Empire. However according to Hermann Kulke and Dietmar Rothermund Ashokas orders seem to have been resisted right from the beginning.Roman law also embraced certain limited forms of liberty even under the rule of the Roman Emperors. However these liberties were accorded only to Roman citizens. Many of the liberties enjoyed under Roman law endured through the Middle Ages but were enjoyed solely by the nobility rarely by the common man.citation needed The idea of inalienable and universal liberties had to wait until the Age of Enlightenment.In French Liberty. British Slavery  James Gillray caricatured French liberty as the opportunity to starve and British slavery as bloated complaints about taxation.The social contract theory most influentially formulated by Hobbes John Locke and Rousseau though first suggested by Plato in The Republic was among the first to provide a political classification of rights in particular through the notion of sovereignty and of natural rights. The thinkers of the Enlightenment reasoned that law governed both heavenly and human affairs and that law gave the king his power rather than the kings power giving force to law. This conception of law would find its culmination in the ideas of Montesquieu. The conception of law as a relationship between individuals rather than families came to the fore and with it the increasing focus on individual liberty as a fundamental reality given by Nature and Natures God which in the ideal state would be as universal as possible.In On Liberty John Stuart Mill sought to define the ...nature and limits of the power which can be legitimately exercised by society over the individual and as such he describes an inherent and continuous antagonism between liberty and authority and thus the prevailing question becomes how to make the fitting adjustment between individual independence and social control.England and following the Act of Union  Great Britain laid down the cornerstones of the concept of individual liberty.In  as a condition of his coronation William the Conqueror assented to the London Charter of Liberties which guaranteed the Saxon liberties of the City of London.In  the Charter of Liberties is passed which sets out certain liberties of nobles church officials and individuals.In  Henry II of England transformed English law by passing the Assize of Clarendon. The act a forerunner to trial by jury started the abolition of trial by combat and trial by ordeal.- sees the publication of Tractatus de legibus et consuetudinibus regni Anglie which contains authoritative definitions of freedom and servitude:Freedom is the natural faculty of doing what each person pleases to do according to his will except what is prohibited to him of right or by force. Sevitude on the other hand may be said to be the contrary as if any person contrary to freedom should be bound upon a covenant to do something or not to do it.In  Magna Carta was enacted arguably becoming the cornerstone of liberty in first England then Great Britain and later the world.In  the English Parliament passed the Petition of Right which set out specific liberties of English subjects.In  the English Parliament passed the Habeas Corpus Act which outlawed unlawful or arbitrary imprisonment.In  the Bill of Rights granted freedom of speech in Parliament and reinforced many existing civil rights in England. The Scots law equivalent the Claim of Right is also passed.In  the Somerset v Stewart judgement found that slavery was unsupported by common law in England and Wales.In  an essay by the philosopher John Stuart Mill entitled On Liberty argued for toleration and individuality. If any opinion is compelled to silence that opinion may for aught we can certainly know be true. To deny this is to assume our own infallibility.In  Two Concepts of Liberty by Isaiah Berlin identified negative liberty as an obstacle as distinct from positive liberty which promotes self-mastery and the concepts of freedom.In  British representatives attempted to but were prevented from adding a legal framework to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It was not until  that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights came into force giving a legal status to most of the Declaration.The depiction of Liberty on the Walking Liberty Half Dollar.According to the  United States Declaration of Independence all men have a natural right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness. But this declaration of liberty was troubled from the outset by the institutionalization of legalized Black slavery. Slave owners argued that their liberty was paramount since it involved property their slaves and that Blacks had no rights that any White man was obliged to recognize. The Supreme Court in the Dred Scott decision upheld this principle. It was not until  following the Civil War that the US Constitution was amended to extend these rights to persons of color and not until  that these rights were extended to women.By the later half of the th century liberty was expanded further to prohibit government interference with personal choices. In the United States Supreme Court decision Griswold v. Connecticut Justice William O. Douglas argued that liberties relating to personal relationships such as marriage have a unique primacy of place in the hierarchy of freedoms. Jacob M. Appel has summarized this principle:I am grateful that I have rights in the proverbial public square – but as a practical matter my most cherished rights are those that I possess in my bedroom and hospital room and death chamber. Most people are far more concerned that they can control their own bodies than they are about petitioning Congress.In modern America various competing ideologies have divergent views about how best to promote liberty. Liberals in the original sense of the word see equality as a necessary component of freedom. Progressives stress freedom from business monopoly as essential. Libertarians disagree and see economic freedom as best. The Tea Party movement sees the undefined big government as the enemy of freedom.France supported the Americans in their revolt against English rule and in  overthrew their own monarchy with the cry of Liberté égalité fraternité. The bloodbath that followed known as the reign of terror soured many people on the idea of liberty. Edmund Burke considered one of the fathers of conservatism wrote The French had shewn themselves the ablest architects of ruin that had hitherto existed in the world.According to the Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics liberalism is the belief that it is the aim of politics to preserve individual rights and to maximize freedom of choice. But they point out that there is considerable discussion about how to achieve those goals. Every discussion of freedom depends on three key components: who is free what they are free to do and what forces restrict their freedom. John Gray argues that the core belief of liberalism is toleration. Liberals allow others freedom to do what they want in exchange for having the same freedom in return. This idea of freedom is personal rather than political. William Safire points out that liberalism is attacked by both the Right and the Left: by the Right for defending such practices as abortion homosexuality and atheism and by the Left for defending free enterprise and the rights of the individual over the collective.Socialists view freedom as a concrete situation as opposed to a purely abstract ideal. Freedom is a state of being where individuals have agency to pursue their creative interests unhindered by coercive social relationships specifically those they are forced to engage in as a requisite for survival under a given social system. Freedom thus requires both the material economic conditions that make freedom possible alongside social relationships and institutions conducive to freedom.The socialist conception of freedom is closely related to the socialist view of creativity and individuality. Influenced by Karl Marxs concept of alienated labor socialists understand freedom to be the ability for an individual to engage in creative work in the absence of alienation where alienated labor refers to work people are forced to perform and un-alienated work refers to individuals pursuing their own creative interests.For Karl Marx meaningful freedom is only attainable in a communist society characterized by superabundance and free access. Such a social arrangement would eliminate the need for alienated labor and enable individuals to pursue their own creative interests leaving them to develop and maximize their full potentialities. This goes alongside Marxs emphasis on the ability of socialism and communism progressively reducing the average length of the workday to expand the realm of freedom or discretionary free time for each person. Marxs notion of communist society and human freedom is thus radically individualistic.While many anarchists see freedom slightly differently all oppose authority including the authority of the state of capitalism and of nationalism. For the Russian revolutionary anarchist Mikhail Bakunin liberty did not mean an abstract ideal but a concrete reality based on the equal liberty of others. In a positive sense liberty consists of the fullest development of all the faculties and powers of every human being by education by scientific training and by material prosperity. Such a conception of liberty is eminently social because it can only be realized in society not in isolation. In a negative sense liberty is the revolt of the individual against all divine collective and individual authority.Some authors have suggested that a virtuous culture must exist as a prerequisite for liberty. Benjamin Franklin stated that only a virtuous people are capable of freedom. As nations become corrupt and vicious they have more need of masters. Madison likewise declared: To suppose that any form of government will secure liberty or happiness without any virtue in the people is a chimerical idea. John Adams acknowledged: Our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.JAuthorityFrom Wikipedia the free encyclopediaJump to navigationJump to searchThis article is about authority as a political concept. For other uses see Authority disambiguation.Authority is the legitimate power which one person or group possesses and practices over another. A civil state usually makes this formal by way of a judicial branch and an executive branch of government. In the exercise of governance the terms authority and power sometimes are inaccurately used as synonyms. The term authority identifies political legitimacy which grants and justifies the right to exercise power of government; and the term power identifies the ability to accomplish an authorized goal by way either of compliance or of obedience; hence authority is the power to make decisions and the legitimacy to make such legal decisions and order their execution.Ancient understandings of authority trace back to Rome and draw later from Catholic Thomistic thought and other traditional understandings. In more modern terms forms of authority include transitional authority exhibited in for example Cambodia public authority in the form of popular power and in more administrative terms bureaucratic or managerial techniques. In terms of bureaucratic governance one limitation of the governmental agents of the executive branch as outlined by George A. Krause is that they are not as close to the popular will as elected representatives are. The claims of authority can extend to national or individual sovereignty which is broadly or provisionally understood as a claim to political authority that is legitimated.Historical applications of authority in political terms include the formation of the city-state of Geneva and experimental treatises involving the topic of authority in relation to education include Emile by Jean-Jacques Rousseau. As David Laitin defines authority is a key concept to be defined in determining the range and role of political theory science and inquiry. The relevance of a grounded understanding of authority includes the basic foundation and formation of political civil and/or ecclesiastical institutions or representatives. In recent years however authority in political contexts has been challenged or questioned.Political philosophyThere have been several contributions to the debate of political authority. Among others Hannah Arendt Carl Joachim Friedrich Thomas Hobbes Alexandre Kojève and Carl Schmitt have provided some of the most remarkable texts.In political philosophy the jurisdiction of political authority the location of sovereignty the balancing of freedom and authority and the requirements of political obligations have been core questions from the time of Plato and Aristotle to the present. Most democratic societies are engaged in an ongoing discussion regarding the legitimate extent of the exercise of governmental authority. In the United States for instance there is a prevailing belief that the political system as instituted by the Founding Fathers should accord the populace as much freedom as reasonable and that government should limit its authority accordingly known as limited government.In the discussion regarding the legitimacy of political authority there are two beliefs at the respective ends of the spectrum. The first is the belief in the absolute freedom of the individual otherwise known as political anarchism. The second is the belief that there must be a central authority in the form of a sovereign that claims ownership and control over the masses. This belief is known as statism. Sovereignty in modern terms can refer either to the adherence to a form of sovereign rule or the individual sovereignty or autonomy of a nation-state. The argument for political anarchy and anti-statism is made by Michael Huemer in his book The Problem of Political Authority. On the other side one of the main arguments for the legitimacy of the state is some form of the “social contract theory” developed by Thomas Hobbes in his  book Leviathan or by Jean-Jacques Rousseau in his political writings on the social contract.SociologySince the emergence of the social sciences authority has become a subject of research in a variety of empirical settings: the family parental authority small groups informal authority of leadership intermediate organizations such as schools churches armies industries and bureaucracies organizational and bureaucratic authority and society-wide or inclusive organizations ranging from the most primitive tribal society to the modern nation-state and intermediate organization political authority.The definition of authority in contemporary social science remains a matter of debate. Max Weber in his essay Politics as a Vocation  divided legitimate authority into three types. Others like Howard Bloom suggest a parallel between authority and respect/reverence for ancestors.The United Kingdom and the Commonwealth realmsThe political authority in the British context can be traced to James VI and I of Scotland who wrote two political treatise called Basilikon Doron and The Trve Lawe of free Monarchies: Or The Reciprock and Mvtvall Dvtie Betwixt a free King and his naturall Subiectes which advocated his right to rule on the basis of the concept of the divine right of kings a theological concept that has basis in multiple religions but in this case Christianity tracing this right to the apostolic succession. The King in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth states are considered the foundations of judicial legislative and executive authority.The United StatesThe understanding of political authority and the exercise of political powers in the American context traces back to the writings of the Founding Fathers including the arguments put forward in The Federalist Papers by James Madison Alexander Hamilton and the First Chief Justice of the United States John Jay and later speeches by the th President of the United States Abraham Lincoln. Our government rests in public opinion President Abraham Lincoln said in . In his  Speech at Peoria Illinois Lincoln espoused the proposition that each man should do precisely as he pleases with all which is exclusively his own a principle existing at the foundation of the sense of justice. This sense of personal ownership and stewardship was integral to the practice of self-government as Abraham Lincoln saw it by a Republican nation and its people. This was because as Abraham Lincoln also declared No man is good enough to govern another man without that others consent.Reason is the capacity of consciously making sense of things applying logic and adapting or justifying practices institutions and beliefs based on new or existing information. It is closely associated with such characteristically human activities as philosophy science language mathematics and art and is normally considered to be a distinguishing ability possessed by humans. Reason is sometimes referred to as rationality.Reasoning is associated with thinking cognition and intellect. The field of logic studies ways in which humans reason formally through argument. Reasoning may be subdivided into forms of logical reasoning such as: deductive reasoning inductive reasoning and abductive reasoning. Aristotle drew a distinction between logical discursive reasoning reason proper and intuitive reasoning in which the reasoning process through intuition—however valid—may tend toward the personal and the subjectively opaque. In some social and political settings logical and intuitive modes of reasoning may clash while in other contexts intuition and formal reason are seen as complementary rather than adversarial. For example in mathematics intuition is often necessary for the creative processes involved with arriving at a formal proof arguably the most difficult of formal reasoning tasks.Reasoning like habit or intuition is one of the ways by which thinking moves from one idea to a related idea. For example reasoning is the means by which rational individuals understand sensory information from their environments or conceptualize abstract dichotomies such as cause and effect truth and falsehood or ideas regarding notions of good or evil. Reasoning as a part of executive decision making is also closely identified with the ability to self-consciously change in terms of goals beliefs attitudes traditions and institutions and therefore with the capacity for freedom and self-determination.In contrast to the use of reason as an abstract noun a reason is a consideration given which either explains or justifies events phenomena or behavior. Reasons justify decisions reasons support explanations of natural phenomena; reasons can be given to explain the actions conduct of individuals.Using reason or reasoning can also be described more plainly as providing good or the best reasons. For example when evaluating a moral decision morality is at the very least the effort to guide ones conduct by reason—that is doing what there are the best reasons for doing—while giving equal and impartial weight to the interests of all those affected by what one does.Psychologists and cognitive scientists have attempted to study and explain how people reason e.g. which cognitive and neural processes are engaged and how cultural factors affect the inferences that people draw. The field of automated reasoning studies how reasoning may or may not be modeled computationally. Animal psychology considers the question of whether animals other than humans can reason.In the English language and other modern European languages reason and related words represent words which have always been used to translate Latin and classical Greek terms in the sense of their philosophical usage.The original Greek term was λόγος logos the root of the modern English word logic but also a word which could mean for example speech or explanation or an account of money handled.As a philosophical term logos was translated in its non-linguistic senses in Latin as ratio. This was originally not just a translation used for philosophy but was also commonly a translation for logos in the sense of an account of money.French raison is derived directly from Latin and this is the direct source of the English word reason.The earliest major philosophers to publish in English such as Francis Bacon Thomas Hobbes and John Locke also routinely wrote in Latin and French and compared their terms to Greek treating the words logos ratio raison and reason as interchangeable. The meaning of the word reason in senses such as human reason also overlaps to a large extent with rationality and the adjective of reason in philosophical contexts is normally rational rather than reasoned or reasonable. Some philosophers Thomas Hobbes for example also used the word ratiocination as a synonym for reasoning.Francisco de Goya The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters El sueño de la razón produce monstruos c. The proposal that reason gives humanity a special position in nature has been argued to be a defining characteristic of western philosophy and later western modern science starting with classical Greece. Philosophy can be described as a way of life based upon reason and in the other direction reason has been one of the major subjects of philosophical discussion since ancient times. Reason is often said to be reflexive or self-correcting and the critique of reason has been a persistent theme in philosophy. It has been defined in different ways at different times by different thinkers about human nature.For many classical philosophers nature was understood teleologically meaning that every type of thing had a definitive purpose which fit within a natural order that was itself understood to have aims. Perhaps starting with Pythagoras or Heraclitus the cosmos is even said to have reason. Reason by this account is not just one characteristic that humans happen to have and that influences happiness amongst other characteristics. Reason was considered of higher stature than other characteristics of human nature such as sociability because it is something humans share with nature itself linking an apparently immortal part of the human mind with the divine order of the cosmos itself. Within the human mind or soul psyche reason was described by Plato as being the natural monarch which should rule over the other parts such as spiritedness thumos and the passions. Aristotle Platos student defined human beings as rational animals emphasizing reason as a characteristic of human nature. He defined the highest human happiness or well being eudaimonia as a life which is lived consistently excellently and completely in accordance with reason.The conclusions to be drawn from the discussions of Aristotle and Plato on this matter are amongst the most debated in the history of philosophy. But teleological accounts such as Aristotles were highly influential for those who attempt to explain reason in a way which is consistent with monotheism and the immortality and divinity of the human soul. For example in the neo-platonist account of Plotinus the cosmos has one soul which is the seat of all reason and the souls of all individual humans are part of this soul. Reason is for Plotinus both the provider of form to material things and the light which brings individuals souls back into line with their source. Such neo-Platonist accounts of the rational part of the human soul were standard amongst medieval Islamic philosophers and under this influence mainly via Averroes came to be debated seriously in Europe until well into the renaissance and they remain important in Iranian philosophy.Subject-centred reason in early modern philosophyThe early modern era was marked by a number of significant changes in the understanding of reason starting in Europe. One of the most important of these changes involved a change in the metaphysical understanding of human beings. Scientists and philosophers began to question the teleological understanding of the world. Nature was no longer assumed to be human-like with its own aims or reason and human nature was no longer assumed to work according to anything other than the same laws of nature which affect inanimate things. This new understanding eventually displaced the previous world view that derived from a spiritual understanding of the universe.Accordingly in the th century René Descartes explicitly rejected the traditional notion of humans as rational animals suggesting instead that they are nothing more than thinking things along the lines of other things in nature. Any grounds of knowledge outside that understanding was therefore subject to doubt.In his search for a foundation of all possible knowledge Descartes deliberately decided to throw into doubt all knowledge – except that of the mind itself in the process of thinking:At this time I admit nothing that is not necessarily true. I am therefore precisely nothing but a thinking thing; that is a mind or intellect or understanding or reason – words of whose meanings I was previously ignorant.This eventually became known as epistemological or subject-centred reason because it is based on the knowing subject who perceives the rest of the world and itself as a set of objects to be studied and successfully mastered by applying the knowledge accumulated through such study. Breaking with tradition and many thinkers after him Descartes explicitly did not divide the incorporeal soul into parts such as reason and intellect describing them as one indivisible incorporeal entity.A contemporary of Descartes Thomas Hobbes described reason as a broader version of addition and subtraction which is not limited to numbers. This understanding of reason is sometimes termed calculative reason. Similar to Descartes Hobbes asserted that No discourse whatsoever can end in absolute knowledge of fact past or to come but that sense and memory is absolute knowledge.In the late th century through the th century John Locke and David Hume developed Descartes line of thought still further. Hume took it in an especially skeptical direction proposing that there could be no possibility of deducing relationships of cause and effect and therefore no knowledge is based on reasoning alone even if it seems otherwise.Hume famously remarked that We speak not strictly and philosophically when we talk of the combat of passion and of reason. Reason is and ought only to be the slave of the passions and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them. Hume also took his definition of reason to unorthodox extremes by arguing unlike his predecessors that human reason is not qualitatively different from either simply conceiving individual ideas or from judgments associating two ideas and that reason is nothing but a wonderful and unintelligible instinct in our souls which carries us along a certain train of ideas and endows them with particular qualities according to their particular situations and relations. It followed from this that animals have reason only much less complex than human reason.In the th century Immanuel Kant attempted to show that Hume was wrong by demonstrating that a transcendental self or I was a necessary condition of all experience. Therefore suggested Kant on the basis of such a self it is in fact possible to reason both about the conditions and limits of human knowledge. And so long as these limits are respected reason can be the vehicle of morality justice aesthetics theories of knowledge epistemology and understanding.In the formulation of Kant who wrote some of the most influential modern treatises on the subject the great achievement of reason German: Vernunft is that it is able to exercise a kind of universal law-making. Kant was able therefore to reformulate the basis of moral-practical theoretical and aesthetic reasoning on universal laws.Here practical reasoning is the self-legislating or self-governing formulation of universal norms and theoretical reasoning the way humans posit universal laws of nature.Under practical reason the moral autonomy or freedom of human beings depends on their ability to behave according to laws that are given to them by the proper exercise of that reason. This contrasted with earlier forms of morality which depended on religious understanding and interpretation or nature for their substance.According to Kant in a free society each individual must be able to pursue their goals however they see fit so long as their actions conform to principles given by reason. He formulated such a principle called the categorical imperative which would justify an action only if it could be universalized:Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.In contrast to Hume then Kant insists that reason itself German Vernunft has natural ends itself the solution to the metaphysical problems especially the discovery of the foundations of morality. Kant claimed that this problem could be solved with his transcendental logic which unlike normal logic is not just an instrument which can be used indifferently as it was for Aristotle but a theoretical science in its own right and the basis of all the others.According to Jürgen Habermas the substantive unity of reason has dissolved in modern times such that it can no longer answer the question How should I live Instead the unity of reason has to be strictly formal or procedural. He thus described reason as a group of three autonomous spheres on the model of Kants three critiques:Cognitive–instrumental reason is the kind of reason employed by the sciences. It is used to observe events to predict and control outcomes and to intervene in the world on the basis of its hypotheses;Moral–practical reason is what we use to deliberate and discuss issues in the moral and political realm according to universalizable procedures similar to Kants categorical imperative; andAesthetic reason is typically found in works of art and literature and encompasses the novel ways of seeing the world and interpreting things that those practices embody.For Habermas these three spheres are the domain of experts and therefore need to be mediated with the lifeworld by philosophers. In drawing such a picture of reason Habermas hoped to demonstrate that the substantive unity of reason which in pre-modern societies had been able to answer questions about the good life could be made up for by the unity of reasons formalizable procedures.Hamann Herder Kant Hegel Kierkegaard Nietzsche Heidegger Foucault Rorty and many other philosophers have contributed to a debate about what reason means or ought to mean. Some like Kierkegaard Nietzsche and Rorty are skeptical about subject-centred universal or instrumental reason and even skeptical toward reason as a whole. Others including Hegel believe that it has obscured the importance of intersubjectivity or spirit in human life and attempt to reconstruct a model of what reason should be.Some thinkers e.g. Foucault believe there are other forms of reason neglected but essential to modern life and to our understanding of what it means to live a life according to reason.In the last several decades a number of proposals have been made to re-orient this critique of reason or to recognize the other voices or new departments of reason:For example in opposition to subject-centred reason Habermas has proposed a model of communicative reason that sees it as an essentially cooperative activity based on the fact of linguistic intersubjectivity.Nikolas Kompridis has proposed a widely encompassing view of reason as that ensemble of practices that contributes to the opening and preserving of openness in human affairs and a focus on reasons possibilities for social change.The philosopher Charles Taylor influenced by the th century German philosopher Martin Heidegger has proposed that reason ought to include the faculty of disclosure which is tied to the way we make sense of things in everyday life as a new department of reason.In the essay What is Enlightenment Michel Foucault proposed a concept of critique based on Kants distinction between private and public uses of reason. This distinction as suggested has two dimensions:Private reason is the reason that is used when an individual is a cog in a machine or when one has a role to play in society and jobs to do: to be a soldier to have taxes to pay to be in charge of a parish to be a civil servant.Public reason is the reason used when one is reasoning as a reasonable being and not as a cog in a machine when one is reasoning as a member of reasonable humanity. In these circumstances the use of reason must be free and public.The terms logic or logical are sometimes used as if they were identical with the term reason or with the concept of being rational or sometimes logic is seen as the most pure or the defining form of reason. For example in modern economics rational choice is assumed to equate to logically consistent choice.Reason and logic can however be thought of as distinct although logic is one important aspect of reason. Author Douglas Hofstadter in Gödel Escher Bach characterizes the distinction in this way. Logic is done inside a system while reason is done outside the system by such methods as skipping steps working backward drawing diagrams looking at examples or seeing what happens if you change the rules of the system.Reason is a type of thought and the word logic involves the attempt to describe rules or norms by which reasoning operates so that orderly reasoning can be taught. The oldest surviving writing to explicitly consider the rules by which reason operates are the works of the Greek philosopher Aristotle especially Prior Analysis and Posterior Analysis. Although the Ancient Greeks had no separate word for logic as distinct from language and reason Aristotles newly coined word syllogism syllogismos identified logic clearly for the first time as a distinct field of study. When Aristotle referred to the logical hē logikē he was referring more broadly to rational thought.Reason compared to cause-and-effect thinking and symbolic thinkingMain articles: Causality and SymbolsAs pointed out by philosophers such as Hobbes Locke and Hume some animals are also clearly capable of a type of associative thinking even to the extent of associating causes and effects. A dog once kicked can learn how to recognize the warning signs and avoid being kicked in the future but this does not mean the dog has reason in any strict sense of the word. It also does not mean that humans acting on the basis of experience or habit are using their reason.Human reason requires more than being able to associate two ideas even if those two ideas might be described by a reasoning human as a cause and an effect perceptions of smoke for example and memories of fire. For reason to be involved the association of smoke and the fire would have to be thought through in a way which can be explained for example as cause and effect. In the explanation of Locke for example reason requires the mental use of a third idea in order to make this comparison by use of syllogism.More generally reason in the strict sense requires the ability to create and manipulate a system of symbols as well as indices and icons according to Charles Sanders Peirce the symbols having only a nominal though habitual connection to either smoke or fire. One example of such a system of artificial symbols and signs is language.The connection of reason to symbolic thinking has been expressed in different ways by philosophers. Thomas Hobbes described the creation of Markes or Notes of remembrance Leviathan Ch.  as speech. He used the word speech as an English version of the Greek word logos so that speech did not need to be communicated. When communicated such speech becomes language and the marks or notes or remembrance are called Signes by Hobbes. Going further back although Aristotle is a source of the idea that only humans have reason logos he does mention that animals with imagination for whom sense perceptions can persist come closest to having something like reasoning and nous and even uses the word logos in one place to describe the distinctions which animals can perceive in such cases.Reason imagination mimesis and memoryMain articles: Imagination Mimesis Memory and RecollectionReason and imagination rely on similar mental processes. Imagination is not only found in humans. Aristotle for example stated that phantasia imagination: that which can hold images or phantasmata and phronein a type of thinking that can judge and understand in some sense also exist in some animals. According to him both are related to the primary perceptive ability of animals which gathers the perceptions of different senses and defines the order of the things that are perceived without distinguishing universals and without deliberation or logos. But this is not yet reason because human imagination is different.The recent modern writings of Terrence Deacon and Merlin Donald writing about the origin of language also connect reason connected to not only language but also mimesis. More specifically they describe the ability to create language as part of an internal modeling of reality specific to humankind. Other results are consciousness and imagination or fantasy. In contrast modern proponents of a genetic predisposition to language itself include Noam Chomsky and Steven Pinker to whom Donald and Deacon can be contrasted.As reason is symbolic thinking and peculiarly human then this implies that humans have a special ability to maintain a clear consciousness of the distinctness of icons or images and the real things they represent. Starting with a modern author Merlin Donald writesA dog might perceive the meaning of a fight that was realistically play-acted by humans but it could not reconstruct the message or distinguish the representation from its referent a real fight. ... Trained apes are able to make this distinction; young children make this distinction early – hence their effortless distinction between play-acting an event and the event itselfIn classical descriptions an equivalent description of this mental faculty is eikasia in the philosophy of Plato. This is the ability to perceive whether a perception is an image of something else related somehow but not the same and therefore allows humans to perceive that a dream or memory or a reflection in a mirror is not reality as such. What Klein refers to as dianoetic eikasia is the eikasia concerned specifically with thinking and mental images such as those mental symbols icons signes and marks discussed above as definitive of reason. Explaining reason from this direction: human thinking is special in the way that we often understand visible things as if they were themselves images of our intelligible objects of thought as foundations hypothēses in Ancient Greek. This thinking dianoia is ...an activity which consists in making the vast and diffuse jungle of the visible world depend on a plurality of more precise noēta.Both Merlin Donald and the Socratic authors such as Plato and Aristotle emphasize the importance of mimesis often translated as imitation or representation. Donald writesImitation is found especially in monkeys and apes ... but ... Mimesis is fundamentally different from imitation and mimicry in that it involves the invention of intentional representations. ... Mimesis is not absolutely tied to external communication.Mimēsis is a concept now popular again in academic discussion that was particularly prevalent in Platos works and within Aristotle it is discussed mainly in the Poetics. In Michael Daviss account of the theory of man in this work.It is the distinctive feature of human action that whenever we choose what we do we imagine an action for ourselves as though we were inspecting it from the outside. Intentions are nothing more than imagined actions internalizings of the external. All action is therefore imitation of action; it is poetic...Donald like Plato and Aristotle especially in On Memory and Recollection emphasizes the peculiarity in humans of voluntary initiation of a search through ones mental world. The ancient Greek anamnēsis normally translated as recollection was opposed to mneme or memory. Memory shared with some animals requires a consciousness not only of what happened in the past but also that something happened in the past which is in other words a kind of eikasia ...but nothing except man is able to recollect. Recollection is a deliberate effort to search for and recapture something once known. Klein writes that To become aware of our having forgotten something means to begin recollecting. Donald calls the same thing autocueing which he explains as follows: Mimetic acts are reproducible on the basis of internal self-generated cues. This permits voluntary recall of mimetic representations without the aid of external cues – probably the earliest form of representational thinking.In a celebrated paper in modern times the fantasy author and philologist J.R.R. Tolkien wrote in his essay On Fairy Stories that the terms fantasy and enchantment are connected to not only ....the satisfaction of certain primordial human desires.... but also ...the origin of language and of the mind.A subdivision of philosophy is logic. Logic is the study of reasoning. Looking at logical categorizations of different types of reasoning the traditional main division made in philosophy is between deductive reasoning and inductive reasoning. Formal logic has been described as the science of deduction. The study of inductive reasoning is generally carried out within the field known as informal logic or critical thinking.Deduction is a form of reasoning in which a conclusion follows necessarily from the stated premises. A deduction is also the conclusion reached by a deductive reasoning process. One classic example of deductive reasoning is that found in syllogisms like the following:Premise : All humans are mortal.Premise : Socrates is a human.Conclusion: Socrates is mortal.The reasoning in this argument is deductively valid because there is no way in which the premises  and  could be true and the conclusion  be false.Induction is a form of inference producing propositions about unobserved objects or types either specifically or generally based on previous observation. It is used to ascribe properties or relations to objects or types based on previous observations or experiences or to formulate general statements or laws based on limited observations of recurring phenomenal patterns.Inductive reasoning contrasts strongly with deductive reasoning in that even in the best or strongest cases of inductive reasoning the truth of the premises does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion. Instead the conclusion of an inductive argument follows with some degree of probability. Relatedly the conclusion of an inductive argument contains more information than is already contained in the premises. Thus this method of reasoning is ampliative.A classic example of inductive reasoning comes from the empiricist David Hume:Premise: The sun has risen in the east every morning up until now.Conclusion: The sun will also rise in the east tomorrow.Analogical reasoningMain article: Analogical reasoningAnalogical reasoning is a form of inductive reasoning from a particular to a particular. It is often used in case-based reasoning especially legal reasoning. An example follows:Premise : Socrates is human and mortal.Premise : Plato is human.Conclusion: Plato is mortal.Analogical reasoning is a weaker form of inductive reasoning from a single example because inductive reasoning typically uses a large number of examples to reason from the particular to the general. Analogical reasoning often leads to wrong conclusions. For example:Premise : Socrates is human and male.Premise : Ada Lovelace is human.Conclusion: Therefore Ada Lovelace is male.Abductive reasoning or argument to the best explanation is a form of reasoning that doesnt fit in deductive or inductive since it starts with incomplete set of observations and proceeds with likely possible explanations so the conclusion in an abductive argument does not follow with certainty from its premises and concerns something unobserved. What distinguishes abduction from the other forms of reasoning is an attempt to favour one conclusion above others by subjective judgement or attempting to falsify alternative explanations or by demonstrating the likelihood of the favoured conclusion given a set of more or less disputable assumptions. For example when a patient displays certain symptoms there might be various possible causes but one of these is preferred above others as being more probable.Flawed reasoning in arguments is known as fallacious reasoning. Bad reasoning within arguments can be because it commits either a formal fallacy or an informal fallacy.Formal fallacies occur when there is a problem with the form or structure of the argument. The word formal refers to this link to the form of the argument. An argument that contains a formal fallacy will always be invalid.An informal fallacy is an error in reasoning that occurs due to a problem with the content rather than mere structure of the argument.Traditional problems raised concerning reasonPhilosophy is sometimes described as a life of reason with normal human reason pursued in a more consistent and dedicated way than usual. Two categories of problem concerning reason have long been discussed by philosophers concerning reason essentially being reasonings about reasoning itself as a human aim or philosophizing about philosophizing. The first question is concerning whether we can be confident that reason can achieve knowledge of truth better than other ways of trying to achieve such knowledge. The other question is whether a life of reason a life that aims to be guided by reason can be expected to achieve a happy life more so than other ways of life whether such a life of reason results in knowledge or not.Since classical times a question has remained constant in philosophical debate which is sometimes seen as a conflict between movements called Platonism and Aristotelianism concerning the role of reason in confirming truth. People use logic deduction and induction to reach conclusions they think are true. Conclusions reached in this way are considered according to Aristotle more certain than sense perceptions on their own. On the other hand if such reasoned conclusions are only built originally upon a foundation of sense perceptions then our most logical conclusions can never be said to be certain because they are built upon the very same fallible perceptions they seek to better.This leads to the question of what types of first principles or starting points of reasoning are available for someone seeking to come to true conclusions. In Greek first principles are archai starting points and the faculty used to perceive them is sometimes referred to in Aristotle and Plato as nous which was close in meaning to awareness or consciousness.Empiricism sometimes associated with Aristotle but more correctly associated with British philosophers such as John Locke and David Hume as well as their ancient equivalents such as Democritus asserts that sensory impressions are the only available starting points for reasoning and attempting to attain truth. This approach always leads to the controversial conclusion that absolute knowledge is not attainable. Idealism associated with Plato and his school claims that there is a higher reality from which certain people can directly arrive at truth without needing to rely only upon the senses and that this higher reality is therefore the primary source of truth.Philosophers such as Plato Aristotle Al-Farabi Avicenna Averroes Maimonides Aquinas and Hegel are sometimes said to have argued that reason must be fixed and discoverable—perhaps by dialectic analysis or study. In the vision of these thinkers reason is divine or at least has divine attributes. Such an approach allowed religious philosophers such as Thomas Aquinas and Étienne Gilson to try to show that reason and revelation are compatible. According to Hegel ...the only thought which Philosophy brings with it to the contemplation of History is the simple conception of reason; that reason is the Sovereign of the World; that the history of the world therefore presents us with a rational process.Since the th century rationalists reason has often been taken to be a subjective faculty or rather the unaided ability pure reason to form concepts. For Descartes Spinoza and Leibniz this was associated with mathematics. Kant attempted to show that pure reason could form concepts time and space that are the conditions of experience. Kant made his argument in opposition to Hume who denied that reason had any role to play in experience.Reason versus emotion or passionSee also: Emotion and Passion emotionAfter Plato and Aristotle western literature often treated reason as being the faculty that trained the passions and appetites.citation needed Stoic philosophy by contrast considered all passions undesirable.citation needed After the critiques of reason in the early Enlightenment the appetites were rarely discussed or conflated with the passions.citation needed Some Enlightenment camps took after the Stoics to say Reason should oppose Passion rather than order it while others like the Romantics believed that Passion displaces Reason as in the maxim follow your heart.citation neededReason has been seen as a slave or judge of the passions notably in the work of David Hume and more recently of Freud.citation needed Reasoning which claims that the object of a desire is demanded by logic alone is called rationalization.citation neededRousseau first proposed in his second Discourse that reason and political life is not natural and possibly harmful to mankind. He asked what really can be said about what is natural to mankind. What other than reason and civil society best suits his constitution Rousseau saw two principles prior to reason in human nature. First we hold an intense interest in our own well-being. Secondly we object to the suffering or death of any sentient being especially one like ourselves. These two passions lead us to desire more than we could achieve. We become dependent upon each other and on relationships of authority and obedience. This effectively puts the human race into slavery. Rousseau says that he almost dares to assert that nature does not destine men to be healthy. According to Velkley Rousseau outlines certain programs of rational self-correction most notably the political legislation of the Contrat Social and the moral education in Émile. All the same Rousseau understands such corrections to be only ameliorations of an essentially unsatisfactory condition that of socially and intellectually corrupted humanity.This quandary presented by Rousseau led to Kants new way of justifying reason as freedom to create good and evil. These therefore are not to be blamed on nature or God. In various ways German Idealism after Kant and major later figures such Nietzsche Bergson Husserl Scheler and Heidegger remain preoccupied with problems coming from the metaphysical demands or urges of reason. The influence of Rousseau and these later writers is also large upon art and politics. Many writers such as Nikos Kazantzakis extol passion and disparage reason. In politics modern nationalism comes from Rousseaus argument that rationalist cosmopolitanism brings man ever further from his natural state.Another view on reason and emotion was proposed in the  book titled Descartes Error by Antonio Damasio. In it Damasio presents the Somatic Marker Hypothesis which states that emotions guide behavior and decision-making. Damasio argues that these somatic markers known collectively as gut feelings are intuitive signals that direct our decision making processes in a certain way that cannot be solved with rationality alone. Damasio further argues that rationality requires emotional input in order to function.There are many religious traditions some of which are explicitly fideist and others of which claim varying degrees of rationalism. Secular critics sometimes accuse all religious adherents of irrationality since they claim such adherents are guilty of ignoring suppressing or forbidding some kinds of reasoning concerning some subjects such as religious dogmas moral taboos etc.. Though the theologies and religions such as classical monotheism typically do not claim to be irrational there is often a perceived conflict or tension between faith and tradition on the one hand and reason on the other as potentially competing sources of wisdom law and truth.Religious adherents sometimes respond by arguing that faith and reason can be reconciled or have different non-overlapping domains or that critics engage in a similar kind of irrationalism:Reconciliation: Philosopher Alvin Plantinga argues that there is no real conflict between reason and classical theism because classical theism explains among other things why the universe is intelligible and why reason can successfully grasp it.Non-overlapping magisteria: Evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould argues that there need not be conflict between reason and religious belief because they are each authoritative in their own domain or magisterium. For example perhaps reason alone is not enough to explain such big questions as the origins of the universe the origin of life the origin of consciousness the foundation of morality or the destiny of the human race. If so reason can work on those problems over which it has authority while other sources of knowledge or opinion can have authority on the big questions.Tu quoque: Philosophers Alasdair MacIntyre and Charles Taylor argue that those critics of traditional religion who are adherents of secular liberalism are also sometimes guilty of ignoring suppressing and forbidding some kinds of reasoning about subjects. Similarly philosophers of science such as Paul Feyarabend argue that scientists sometimes ignore or suppress evidence contrary to the dominant paradigm.Unification: Theologian Joseph Ratzinger later Benedict XVI asserted that Christianity has understood itself as the religion of the Logos as the religion according to reason referring to John :Ἐν ἀρχῇ ἦν ὁ λόγος usually translated as In the beginning was the Word Logos. Thus he said that the Christian faith is open to all that is truly rational and that the rationality of Western Enlightenment is of Christian origin.Some commentators have claimed that Western civilization can be almost defined by its serious testing of the limits of tension between unaided reason and faith in revealed truths—figuratively summarized as Athens and Jerusalem respectively. Leo Strauss spoke of a Greater West that included all areas under the influence of the tension between Greek rationalism and Abrahamic revelation including the Muslim lands. He was particularly influenced by the great Muslim philosopher Al-Farabi. To consider to what extent Eastern philosophy might have partaken of these important tensions Strauss thought it best to consider whether dharma or tao may be equivalent to Nature by which we mean physis in Greek. According to Strauss the beginning of philosophy involved the discovery or invention of nature and the pre-philosophical equivalent of nature was supplied by such notions as custom or ways which appear to be really universal in all times and places. The philosophical concept of nature or natures as a way of understanding archai first principles of knowledge brought about a peculiar tension between reasoning on the one hand and tradition or faith on the other.Although there is this special history of debate concerning reason and faith in the Islamic Christian and Jewish traditions the pursuit of reason is sometimes argued to be compatible with the other practice of other religions of a different nature such as Hinduism because they do not define their tenets in such an absolute way.Aristotle famously described reason with language as a part of human nature which means that it is best for humans to live politically meaning in communities of about the size and type of a small city state polis in Greek. For example...It is clear then that a human being is more of a political politikon = of the polis animal zōion than is any bee or than any of those animals that live in herds. For nature as we say makes nothing in vain and humans are the only animals who possess reasoned speech logos. Voice of course serves to indicate what is painful and pleasant; that is why it is also found in other animals because their nature has reached the point where they can perceive what is painful and pleasant and express these to each other. But speech logos serves to make plain what is advantageous and harmful and so also what is just and unjust. For it is a peculiarity of humans in contrast to the other animals to have perception of good and bad just and unjust and the like; and the community in these things makes a household or city polis. ... By nature then the drive for such a community exists in everyone but the first to set one up is responsible for things of very great goodness. For as humans are the best of all animals when perfected so they are the worst when divorced from law and right. The reason is that injustice is most difficult to deal with when furnished with weapons and the weapons a human being has are meant by nature to go along with prudence and virtue but it is only too possible to turn them to contrary uses. Consequently if a human being lacks virtue he is the most unholy and savage thing and when it comes to sex and food the worst. But justice is something political to do with the polis for right is the arrangement of the political community and right is discrimination of what is just. Aristotles Politics a .. Peter Simpsons translation with Greek terms inserted in square brackets.The concept of human nature being fixed in this way implied in other words that we can define what type of community is always best for people. This argument has remained a central argument in all political ethical and moral thinking since then and has become especially controversial since firstly Rousseaus Second Discourse and secondly the Theory of Evolution. Already in Aristotle there was an awareness that the polis had not always existed and had needed to be invented or developed by humans themselves. The household came first and the first villages and cities were just extensions of that with the first cities being run as if they were still families with Kings acting like fathers.Friendship philia seems to prevail in man and woman according to nature kata phusin; for people are by nature tēi phusei pairing sunduastikon more than political politikon = of the polis in as much as the household oikos is prior proteron = earlier and more necessary than the polis and making children is more common koinoteron with the animals. In the other animals community koinōnia goes no further than this but people live together sumoikousin not only for the sake of making children but also for the things for life; for from the start the functions erga are divided and are different for man and woman. Thus they supply each other putting their own into the common eis to koinon. It is for these reasons that both utility chrēsimon and pleasure hēdu seem to be found in this kind of friendship. Nicomachean Ethics VIII..a. Rough literal translation with Greek terms shown in square brackets.Rousseau in his Second Discourse finally took the shocking step of claiming that this traditional account has things in reverse: with reason language and rationally organized communities all having developed over a long period of time merely as a result of the fact that some habits of cooperation were found to solve certain types of problems and that once such cooperation became more important it forced people to develop increasingly complex cooperation—often only to defend themselves from each other.In other words according to Rousseau reason language and rational community did not arise because of any conscious decision or plan by humans or gods nor because of any pre-existing human nature. As a result he claimed living together in rationally organized communities like modern humans is a development with many negative aspects compared to the original state of man as an ape. If anything is specifically human in this theory it is the flexibility and adaptability of humans. This view of the animal origins of distinctive human characteristics later received support from Charles Darwins Theory of Evolution.The two competing theories concerning the origins of reason are relevant to political and ethical thought because according to the Aristotelian theory a best way of living together exists independently of historical circumstances. According to Rousseau we should even doubt that reason language and politics are a good thing as opposed to being simply the best option given the particular course of events that lead to today. Rousseaus theory that human nature is malleable rather than fixed is often taken to imply for example by Karl Marx a wider range of possible ways of living together than traditionally known.However while Rousseaus initial impact encouraged bloody revolutions against traditional politics including both the French Revolution and the Russian Revolution his own conclusions about the best forms of community seem to have been remarkably classical in favor of city-states such as Geneva and rural living.Scientific research into reasoning is carried out within the fields of psychology and cognitive science. Psychologists attempt to determine whether or not people are capable of rational thought in a number of different circumstances.Assessing how well someone engages in reasoning is the project of determining the extent to which the person is rational or acts rationally. It is a key research question in the psychology of reasoning. Rationality is often divided into its respective theoretical and practical counterparts.Behavioral experiments on human reasoningExperimental cognitive psychologists carry out research on reasoning behaviour. Such research may focus for example on how people perform on tests of reasoning such as intelligence or IQ tests or on how well peoples reasoning matches ideals set by logic see for example the Wason test. Experiments examine how people make inferences from conditionals e.g. If A then B and how they make inferences about alternatives e.g. A or else B. They test whether people can make valid deductions about spatial and temporal relations e.g. A is to the left of B or A happens after B and about quantified assertions e.g. All the A are B. Experiments investigate how people make inferences about factual situations hypothetical possibilities probabilities and counterfactual situations.Developmental psychologists investigate the development of reasoning from birth to adulthood. Piagets theory of cognitive development was the first complete theory of reasoning development. Subsequently several alternative theories were proposed including the neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development.The biological functioning of the brain is studied by neurophysiologists and neuropsychologists. Research in this area includes research into the structure and function of normally functioning brains and of damaged or otherwise unusual brains. In addition to carrying out research into reasoning some psychologists for example clinical psychologists and psychotherapists work to alter peoples reasoning habits when they are unhelpful.In artificial intelligence and computer science scientists study and use automated reasoning for diverse applications including automated theorem proving the formal semantics of programming languages and formal specification in software engineering.Meta-reasoning is reasoning about reasoning. In computer science a system performs meta-reasoning when it is reasoning about its own operation. This requires a programming language capable of reflection the ability to observe and modify its own structure and behaviour.Dan Sperber believes that reasoning in groups is more effective and promotes their evolutionary fitness.A species could benefit greatly from better abilities to reason about predict and understand the world. French social and cognitive scientists Dan Sperber and Hugo Mercier argue that there could have been other forces driving the evolution of reason. They point out that reasoning is very difficult for humans to do effectively and that it is hard for individuals to doubt their own beliefs confirmation bias. Reasoning is most effective when it is done as a collective – as demonstrated by the success of projects like science. They suggest that there are not just individual but group selection pressures at play. Any group that managed to find ways of reasoning effectively would reap benefits for all its members increasing their fitness. This could also help explain why humans according to Sperber are not optimized to reason effectively alone. Their argumentative theory of reasoning claims that reason may have more to do with winning arguments than with the search for the truth.Critical thinking is the analysis of facts to form a judgment. The subject is complex and several different definitions exist which generally include the rational skeptical unbiased analysis or evaluation of factual evidence. Critical thinking is self-directed self-disciplined self-monitored and self-corrective thinking. It presupposes assent to rigorous standards of excellence and mindful command of their use. It entails effective communication and problem-solving abilities as well as a commitment to overcome native egocentrism and sociocentrism.The earliest records of critical thinking are the teachings of Socrates recorded by Plato. These included a part in Platos early dialogues where Socrates engages with one or more interlocutors on the issue of ethics such as question whether it was right for Socrates to escape from prison. The philosopher considered and reflected on this question and came to the conclusion that escape violates all the things that he holds higher than himself: the laws of Athens and the guiding voice that Socrates claims to hear.Socrates established the fact that one cannot depend upon those in authority to have sound knowledge and insight. He demonstrated that persons may have power and high position and yet be deeply confused and irrational. Socrates maintained that for an individual to have a good life or to have one that is worth living he must be critical questioner or must have an interrogative soul. He established the importance of asking deep questions that probe profoundly into thinking before we accept ideas as worthy of belief.Socrates established the importance of seeking evidence closely examining reasoning and assumptions analyzing basic concepts and tracing out implications not only of what is said but of what is done as well. His method of questioning is now known as Socratic questioning and is the best known critical thinking teaching strategy. In his mode of questioning Socrates highlighted the need for thinking for clarity and logical consistency. He asked people questions to reveal their irrational thinking or lack of reliable knowledge. Socrates demonstrated that having authority does not ensure accurate knowledge. He established the method of questioning beliefs closely inspecting assumptions and relying on evidence and sound rationale. Plato recorded Socrates teachings and carried on the tradition of critical thinking. Aristotle and subsequent Greek skeptics refined Socrates teachings using systematic thinking and asking questions to ascertain the true nature of reality beyond the way things appear from a glance.Socrates set the agenda for the tradition of critical thinking namely to reflectively question common beliefs and explanations carefully distinguishing beliefs that are reasonable and logical from those that—however appealing to our native egocentrism however much they serve our vested interests however comfortable or comforting they may be—lack adequate evidence or rational foundation to warrant belief.Critical thinking was described by Richard W. Paul as a movement in two waves . The first wave of critical thinking is often referred to as a critical analysis that is clear rational thinking involving critique. Its details vary amongst those who define it. According to Barry K. Beyer  critical thinking means making clear reasoned judgments. During the process of critical thinking ideas should be reasoned well thought out and judged. The U.S. National Council for Excellence in Critical Thinking defines critical thinking as the intellectually disciplined process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing applying analyzing synthesizing or evaluating information gathered from or generated by observation experience reflection reasoning or communication as a guide to belief and action.In the term critical thinking the word critical Grk. κριτικός = kritikos = critic derives from the word critic and implies a critique; it identifies the intellectual capacity and the means of judging of judgement for judging and of being able to discern. The intellectual roots of critical thinking are as ancient as its etymology traceable ultimately to the teaching practice and vision of Socrates  years ago who discovered by a method of probing questioning that people could not rationally justify their confident claims to knowledge.Traditionally critical thinking has been variously defined as follows:The process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing applying analyzing synthesizing and evaluating information to reach an answer or conclusionDisciplined thinking that is clear rational open-minded and informed by evidencePurposeful self-regulatory judgment which results in interpretation analysis evaluation and inference as well as explanation of the evidential conceptual methodological criteriological or contextual considerations upon which that judgment is basedIncludes a commitment to using reason in the formulation of our beliefsThe skill and propensity to engage in an activity with reflective scepticism McPeck Thinking about ones thinking in a manner designed to organize and clarify raise the efficiency of and recognize errors and biases in ones own thinking. Critical thinking is not hard thinking nor is it directed at solving problems other than improving ones own thinking. Critical thinking is inward-directed with the intent of maximizing the rationality of the thinker. One does not use critical thinking to solve problems—one uses critical thinking to improve ones process of thinking.An appraisal based on careful analytical evaluationCritical thinking is a type of thinking pattern that requires people to be reflective and pay attention to decision-making which guides their beliefs and actions. Critical thinking allows people to deduct with more logic to process sophisticated information and to look at various sides of issues so that they can produce more solid conclusions.Critical thinking has seven critical features: being inquisitive and curious being open-minded to different sides being able to think systematically being analytical being persistent to truth being confident about critical thinking itself and lastly being mature.Although critical thinking could be defined in several different ways there is a general agreement in its key component—the desire to reach for a satisfactory result and this should be achieved by rational thinking and result-driven manner. Halpern thinks that critical thinking firstly involves learned abilities such as problem-solving calculation and successful probability application. It also includes a tendency to engage the thinking process. In recent times Stanovich believed that modern IQ test could hardly measure the ability of critical thinking.Contemporary critical thinking scholars have expanded these traditional definitions to include qualities concepts and processes such as creativity imagination discovery reflection empathy connecting knowing feminist theory subjectivity ambiguity and inconclusiveness. Some definitions of critical thinking exclude these subjective practices.According to Ennis Critical thinking is the intellectually disciplined process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing applying analyzing synthesizing and/or evaluating information gathered from or generated by observation experience reflection reasoning or communication as a guide to belief and action. This definition Ennis provided is highly agreed by Harvey Siegel Peter Facione and Deanna Kuhn.According to the definition by Ennis critical thinking requires a lot of attention and brain function. When critical thinking approach toward education it will help the students brain to be more function-able and understand texts differently.Critical thinking can be specifically identified into many different portions different fields of student requires different types of critical thinking. Critical thinking provides more angles and perspectives upon the same materialThe study of logical argumentation is relevant to the study of critical thinking. Logic is concerned with the analysis of arguments including the appraisal of their correctness or incorrectness. In the field of epistemology critical thinking is considered to be logically correct thinking which allows for differentiation between logically true and logically false statements.In First wave logical thinking the thinker is removed from the train of thought and the analysis of connections between concepts or points in thought is ostencibly free of any bias. In his essay Beyond Logicism in Critical Thinking Kerry S. Walters describes this ideology thus: A logistic approach to critical thinking conveys the message to students that thinking is legitimate only when it conforms to the procedures of informal and to a lesser extent formal logic and that the good thinker necessarily aims for styles of examination and appraisal that are analytical abstract universal and objective. This model of thinking has become so entrenched in conventional academic wisdom that many educators accept it as canon. Such principles are concomitant with the increasing dependence on a quantitative understanding of the world.In the second wave of critical thinking authors consciously moved away from the logocentric mode of critical thinking characteristic of the first wave. Although many scholars began to take a less exclusive view of what constitutes critical thinking rationality and logic remain widely accepted as essential bases for critical thinking. Walters argues that exclusive logicism in the first wave sense is based on the unwarranted assumption that good thinking is reducible to logical thinking.There are three types of logical reasoning. Informally two kinds of logical reasoning can be distinguished in addition to formal deduction which are induction and abduction.DeductionDeduction is the conclusion drawn from the structure of an arguments premises by use of rules of inference formally those of propositional calculus. For example: X is human and all humans have a face so X has a face.InductionInduction is drawing a conclusion from a pattern that is guaranteed by the strictness of the structure to which it applies. For example: The sum of even integers is even. Let {\displaystyle xyz\in \mathbb {Z} }{\displaystyle xyz\in \mathbb {Z} } then {\displaystyle xyz}{\displaystyle xyz} are even by definition. {\displaystyle x+y=x+y=z}{\displaystyle x+y=x+y=z} which is even; so summing two even numbers results in an even number.AbductionAbduction is drawing a conclusion using a heuristic that is likely but not inevitable given some foreknowledge. For example: I observe sheep in a field and they appear white from my viewing angle so sheep are white. Contrast with the deductive statement: Some sheep are white on at least one side.Critical thinking and rationalityKerry S. Walters an emeritus philosophy professor from Gettysburg College argues that rationality demands more than just logical or traditional methods of problem solving and analysis or what he calls the calculus of justification but also considers cognitive acts such as imagination conceptual creativity intuition and insight p. . These functions are focused on discovery on more abstract processes instead of linear rules-based approaches to problem-solving. The linear and non-sequential mind must both be engaged in the rational mind.The ability to critically analyze an argument—to dissect structure and components thesis and reasons—is essential. But so is the ability to be flexible and consider non-traditional alternatives and perspectives. These complementary functions are what allow for critical thinking to be a practice encompassing imagination and intuition in cooperation with traditional modes of deductive inquiry.FunctionsThe list of core critical thinking skills includes observation interpretation analysis inference evaluation explanation and metacognition. According to Reynolds  an individual or group engaged in a strong way of critical thinking gives due consideration to establish for instance:Evidence through realityContext skills to isolate the problem from contextRelevant criteria for making the judgment wellApplicable methods or techniques for forming the judgmentApplicable theoretical constructs for understanding the problem and the question at handIn addition to possessing strong critical-thinking skills one must be disposed to engage problems and decisions using those skills. Critical thinking employs not only logic but broad intellectual criteria such as clarity credibility accuracy precision relevance depth breadth significance and fairness.Critical thinking calls for the ability to:Recognize problems to find workable means for meeting those problemsUnderstand the importance of prioritization and order of precedence in problem-solvingGather and marshal pertinent relevant informationRecognize unstated assumptions and valuesComprehend and use language with accuracy clarity and discernmentInterpret data to appraise evidence and evaluate argumentsRecognize the existence or non-existence of logical relationships between propositionsDraw warranted conclusions and generalizationsPut to test the conclusions and generalizations at which one arrivesReconstruct ones patterns of beliefs on the basis of wider experienceRender accurate judgments about specific things and qualities in everyday lifeIn sum:A persistent effort to examine any belief or supposed form of knowledge in the light of the evidence that supports or refutes it and the further conclusions to which it tends.The habits of mind that characterize a person strongly disposed toward critical thinking include a desire to follow reason and evidence wherever they may lead a systematic approach to problem solving inquisitiveness even-handedness and confidence in reasoning.According to a definition analysis by Kompf & Bond  critical thinking involves problem solving decision making metacognition rationality rational thinking reasoning knowledge intelligence and also a moral component such as reflective thinking. Critical thinkers therefore need to have reached a level of maturity in their development possess a certain attitude as well as a set of taught skills.There is a postulation by some writers that the tendencies from habits of mind should be thought as virtues to demonstrate the characteristics of a critical thinker. These intellectual virtues are ethical qualities that encourage motivation to think in particular ways towards specific circumstances. However these virtues have also been criticized by skeptics who argue that there is lacking evidence for this specific mental basis that are causative to critical thinking.Edward M. Glaser proposed that the ability to think critically involves three elements:An attitude of being disposed to consider in a thoughtful way the problems and subjects that come within the range of ones experiencesKnowledge of the methods of logical inquiry and reasoningSome skill in applying those methods.Educational programs aimed at developing critical thinking in children and adult learners individually or in group problem solving and decision making contexts continue to address these same three central elements.The Critical Thinking project at Human Science Lab London is involved in the scientific study of all major educational systems in prevalence today to assess how the systems are working to promote or impede critical thinking.Contemporary cognitive psychology regards human reasoning as a complex process that is both reactive and reflective. This presents a problem which is detailed as a division of a critical mind in juxtaposition to sensory data and memory.The psychological theory disposes of the absolute nature of the rational mind in reference to conditions abstract problems and discursive limitations. Where the relationship between critical thinking skills and critical thinking dispositions is an empirical question the ability to attain causal domination exists for which Socrates was known to be largely disposed against as the practice of Sophistry. Accounting for a measure of critical thinking dispositions is the California Measure of Mental Motivation and the California Critical Thinking Dispositions Inventory. The Critical Thinking Toolkit is an alternative measure that examines student beliefs and attitudes about critical thinkingJohn Dewey is one of many educational leaders who recognized that a curriculum aimed at building thinking skills would benefit the individual learner the community and the entire democracy.Critical thinking is significant in the learning process of internalization in the construction of basic ideas principles and theories inherent in content. And critical thinking is significant in the learning process of application whereby those ideas principles and theories are implemented effectively as they become relevant in learners lives.Each discipline adapts its use of critical thinking concepts and principles. The core concepts are always there but they are embedded in subject-specific content. For students to learn content intellectual engagement is crucial. All students must do their own thinking their own construction of knowledge. Good teachers recognize this and therefore focus on the questions readings activities that stimulate the mind to take ownership of key concepts and principles underlying the subject.Historically the teaching of critical thinking focused only on logical procedures such as formal and informal logic. This emphasized to students that good thinking is equivalent to logical thinking. However a second wave of critical thinking urges educators to value conventional techniques meanwhile expanding what it means to be a critical thinker. In  Kerry Walters compiled a conglomeration of sources surpassing this logical restriction to include many different authors research regarding connected knowing empathy gender-sensitive ideals collaboration world views intellectual autonomy morality and enlightenment. These concepts invite students to incorporate their own perspectives and experiences into their thinking.In the English and Welsh school systems Critical Thinking is offered as a subject that - to -year-olds can take as an A-Level. Under the OCR exam board students can sit two exam papers for the AS: Credibility of Evidence and Assessing and Developing Argument. The full Advanced GCE is now available: in addition to the two AS units candidates sit the two papers Resolution of Dilemmas and Critical Reasoning. The A-level tests candidates on their ability to think critically about and analyze arguments on their deductive or inductive validity as well as producing their own arguments. It also tests their ability to analyze certain related topics such as credibility and ethical decision-making. However due to its comparative lack of subject content many universities do not accept it as a main A-level for admissions. Nevertheless the AS is often useful in developing reasoning skills and the full Advanced GCE is useful for degree courses in politics philosophy history or theology providing the skills required for critical analysis that are useful for example in biblical study.There used to also be an Advanced Extension Award offered in Critical Thinking in the UK open to any A-level student regardless of whether they have the Critical Thinking A-level. Cambridge International Examinations have an A-level in Thinking Skills.From  Assessment and Qualifications Alliance has also been offering an A-level Critical Thinking specification. OCR exam board have also modified theirs for . Many examinations for university entrance set by universities on top of A-level examinations also include a critical thinking component such as the LNAT the UKCAT the BioMedical Admissions Test and the Thinking Skills Assessment.In Qatar critical thinking was offered by AL-Bairaq—an outreach non-traditional educational program that targets high school students and focuses on a curriculum based on STEM fields. The idea behind AL-Bairaq is to offer high school students the opportunity to connect with the research environment in the Center for Advanced Materials CAM at Qatar University. Faculty members train and mentor the students and help develop and enhance their critical thinking problem-solving and teamwork skills.failed verificationIn  a meta-analysis of the literature on teaching effectiveness in higher education was undertaken. The study noted concerns from higher education politicians and business that higher education was failing to meet societys requirements for well-educated citizens. It concluded that although faculty may aspire to develop students thinking skills in practice they have tended to aim at facts and concepts utilizing lowest levels of cognition rather than developing intellect or values.In a more recent meta-analysis researchers reviewed  quasi- or true-experimental studies all of which used some form of standardized critical thinking measure to assess the outcome variable. The authors describe the various methodological approaches and attempt to categorize the differing assessment tools which include standardized tests and second-source measures tests developed by teachers tests developed by researchers and tests developed by teachers who also serve the role as the researcher. The results emphasized the need for exposing students to real-world problems and the importance of encouraging open dialogue within a supportive environment. Effective strategies for teaching critical thinking are thought to be possible in a wide variety of educational settings. One attempt to assess the humanities role in teaching critical thinking and reducing belief in pseudoscientific claims was made at North Carolina State University. Some success was noted and the researchers emphasized the value of the humanities in providing the skills to evaluate current events and qualitative data in context.Scott Lilienfeld notes that there is some evidence to suggest that basic critical thinking skills might be successfully taught to children at a younger age than previously thought.Critical thinking is an important element of all professional fields and academic disciplines by referencing their respective sets of permissible questions evidence sources criteria etc.. Within the framework of scientific skepticism the process of critical thinking involves the careful acquisition and interpretation of information and use of it to reach a well-justified conclusion. The concepts and principles of critical thinking can be applied to any context or case but only by reflecting upon the nature of that application. Critical thinking forms therefore a system of related and overlapping modes of thought such as anthropological thinking sociological thinking historical thinking political thinking psychological thinking philosophical thinking mathematical thinking chemical thinking biological thinking ecological thinking legal thinking ethical thinking musical thinking thinking like a painter sculptor engineer business person etc. In other words though critical thinking principles are universal their application to disciplines requires a process of reflective contextualization. Psychology offerings for example have included courses such as Critical Thinking about the Paranormal in which students are subjected to a series of cold readings and tested on their belief of the psychic who is eventually announced to be a fake.Critical thinking is considered important in the academic fields for enabling one to analyze evaluate explain and restructure thinking thereby ensuring the act of thinking without false belief. However even with knowledge of the methods of logical inquiry and reasoning mistakes occur and due to a thinkers inability to apply the methodology consistently and because of overruling character traits such as egocentrism. Critical thinking includes identification of prejudice bias propaganda self-deception distortion misinformation etc. Given research in cognitive psychology some educators believe that schools should focus on teaching their students critical thinking skills and cultivation of intellectual traits.Critical thinking skills can be used to help nurses during the assessment process. Through the use of critical thinking nurses can question evaluate and reconstruct the nursing care process by challenging the established theory and practice. Critical thinking skills can help nurses problem solve reflect and make a conclusive decision about the current situation they face. Critical thinking creates new possibilities for the development of the nursing knowledge. Due to the sociocultural environmental and political issues that are affecting healthcare delivery it would be helpful to embody new techniques in nursing. Nurses can also engage their critical thinking skills through the Socratic method of dialogue and reflection. This practice standard is even part of some regulatory organizations such as the College of Nurses of Ontarios Professional Standards for Continuing Competencies . It requires nurses to engage in Reflective Practice and keep records of this continued professional development for possible review by the College.Critical thinking is also considered important for human rights education for toleration. The Declaration of Principles on Tolerance adopted by UNESCO in  affirms that education for tolerance could aim at countering factors that lead to fear and exclusion of others and could help young people to develop capacities for independent judgement critical thinking and ethical reasoning.The advent and rising popularity of online courses have prompted some to ask if computer-mediated communication CMC promotes hinders or has no effect on the amount and quality of critical thinking in a course relative to face-to-face communication. There is some evidence to suggest a fourth more nuanced possibility: that CMC may promote some aspects of critical thinking but hinder others. For example Guiller et al.  found that relative to face-to-face discourse online discourse featured more justifications while face-to-face discourse featured more instances of students expanding on what others had said. The increase in justifications may be due to the asynchronous nature of online discussions while the increase in expanding comments may be due to the spontaneity of real-time discussion. Newman et al.  showed similar differential effects. They found that while CMC boasted more important statements and linking of ideas it lacked novelty. The authors suggest that this may be due to difficulties participating in a brainstorming-style activity in an asynchronous environment. Rather the asynchrony may promote users to put forth considered thought out contributions.Researchers assessing critical thinking in online discussion forums often employ a technique called Content Analysis where the text of online discourse or the transcription of face-to-face discourse is systematically coded for different kinds of statements relating to critical thinking. For example a statement might be coded as Discuss ambiguities to clear them up or Welcoming outside knowledge as positive indicators of critical thinking. Conversely statements reflecting poor critical thinking may be labeled as Sticking to prejudice or assumptions or Squashing attempts to bring in outside knowledge. The frequency of these codes in CMC and face-to-face discourse can be compared to draw conclusions about the quality of critical thinking.Searching for evidence of critical thinking in discourse has roots in a definition of critical thinking put forth by Kuhn  which emphasizes the social nature of discussion and knowledge construction. There is limited research on the role of social experience in critical thinking development but there is some evidence to suggest it is an important factor. For example research has shown that - to -year-old children can discern to some extent the differential creditability and expertise of individuals. Further evidence for the impact of social experience on the development of critical thinking skills comes from work that found that - to -year-olds from China have similar levels of skepticism to - and -year-olds in the United States. If the development of critical thinking skills was solely due to maturation it is unlikely we would see such dramatic differences across cultures.Abstraction in its main sense is a conceptual process where general rules and concepts are derived from the usage and classification of specific examples literal real or concrete signifiers first principles or other methods.An abstraction is the outcome of this process—a concept that acts as a common noun for all subordinate concepts and connects any related concepts as a group field or category.Conceptual abstractions may be formed by filtering the information content of a concept or an observable phenomenon selecting only the aspects which are relevant for a particular subjectively valued purpose. For example abstracting a leather soccer ball to the more general idea of a ball selects only the information on general ball attributes and behavior excluding but not eliminating the other phenomenal and cognitive characteristics of that particular ball. In a type–token distinction a type e.g. a ball is more abstract than its tokens e.g. that leather soccer ball.Abstraction in its secondary use is a material process discussed in the themes below.Thinking in abstractions is considered by anthropologists archaeologists and sociologists to be one of the key traits in modern human behaviour which is believed to have developed between  and  years ago. Its development is likely to have been closely connected with the development of human language which whether spoken or written appears to both involve and facilitate abstract thinking.Abstraction involves induction of ideas or the synthesis of particular facts into one general theory about something. It is the opposite of specification which is the analysis or breaking-down of a general idea or abstraction into concrete facts. Abstraction can be illustrated with Francis Bacons Novum Organum  a book of modern scientific philosophy written in the late Jacobean era of England to encourage modern thinkers to collect specific facts before making any generalizations.Bacon used and promoted induction as an abstraction tool and it countered the ancient deductive-thinking approach that had dominated the intellectual world since the times of Greek philosophers like Thales Anaximander and Aristotle. Thales c. – BCE believed that everything in the universe comes from one main substance water. He deduced or specified from a general idea everything is water to the specific forms of water such as ice snow fog and rivers.Modern scientists can also use the opposite approach of abstraction or going from particular facts collected into one general idea such as the motion of the planets Newton –. When determining that the sun is the center of our solar system Copernicus – scientists had to utilize thousands of measurements to finally conclude that Mars moves in an elliptical orbit about the sun Kepler – or to assemble multiple specific facts into the law of falling bodies Galileo –.An abstraction can be seen as a compression process mapping multiple different pieces of constituent data to a single piece of abstract data; based on similarities in the constituent data for example many different physical cats map to the abstraction CAT. This conceptual scheme emphasizes the inherent equality of both constituent and abstract data thus avoiding problems arising from the distinction between abstract and concrete. In this sense the process of abstraction entails the identification of similarities between objects and the process of associating these objects with an abstraction which is itself an object.For example picture  below illustrates the concrete relationship Cat sits on Mat.Chains of abstractions can be construed moving from neural impulses arising from sensory perception to basic abstractions such as color or shape to experiential abstractions such as a specific cat to semantic abstractions such as the idea of a CAT to classes of objects such as mammals and even categories such as object as opposed to action.For example graph  below expresses the abstraction agent sits on location. This conceptual scheme entails no specific hierarchical taxonomy such as the one mentioned involving cats and mammals only a progressive exclusion of detail.InstantiationNon-existent things in any particular place and time are often seen as abstract. By contrast instances or members of such an abstract thing might exist in many different places and times.Those abstract things are then said to be multiply instantiated in the sense of picture  picture  etc. shown below. It is not sufficient however to define abstract ideas as those that can be instantiated and to define abstraction as the movement in the opposite direction to instantiation. Doing so would make the concepts cat and telephone abstract ideas since despite their varying appearances a particular cat or a particular telephone is an instance of the concept cat or the concept telephone. Although the concepts cat and telephone are abstractions they are not abstract in the sense of the objects in graph  below. We might look at other graphs in a progression from cat to mammal to animal and see that animal is more abstract than mammal; but on the other hand mammal is a harder idea to express certainly in relation to marsupial or monotreme.Perhaps confusingly some philosophies refer to tropes instances of properties as abstract particulars—e.g. the particular redness of a particular apple is an abstract particular. This is similar to qualia and sumbebekos.Still retaining the primary meaning of abstrere or to draw away from the abstraction of money for example works by drawing away from the particular value of things allowing completely incommensurate objects to be compared see the section on Physicality below. Karl Marxs writing on the commodity abstraction recognizes a parallel process.The state polity as both concept and material practice exemplifies the two sides of this process of abstraction. Conceptually the current concept of the state is an abstraction from the much more concrete early-modern use as the standing or status of the prince his visible estates. At the same time materially the practice of statehood is now constitutively and materially more abstract than at the time when princes ruled as the embodiment of extended power.The way that physical objects like rocks and trees have being differs from the way that properties of abstract concepts or relations have being for example the way the concrete particular individuals pictured in picture  exist differs from the way the concepts illustrated in graph  exist. That difference accounts for the ontological usefulness of the word abstract. The word applies to properties and relations to mark the fact that if they exist they do not exist in space or time but that instances of them can exist potentially in many different places and times.Further information: History of accounting § Ancient historyA physical object a possible referent of a concept or word is considered concrete not abstract if it is a particular individual that occupies a particular place and time. However in the secondary sense of the term abstraction this physical object can carry materially abstracting processes. For example record-keeping aids throughout the Fertile Crescent included calculi clay spheres cones etc. which represented counts of items probably livestock or grains sealed in containers. According to Schmandt-Besserat &  these clay containers contained tokens the total of which were the count of objects being transferred. The containers thus served as something of a bill of lading or an accounts book. In order to avoid breaking open the containers for the count marks were placed on the outside of the containers. These physical marks in other words acted as material abstractions of a materially abstract process of accounting using conceptual abstractions numbers to communicate its meaning.Abstract things are sometimes defined as those things that do not exist in reality or exist only as sensory experiences like the color red. That definition however suffers from the difficulty of deciding which things are real i.e. which things exist in reality. For example it is difficult to agree to whether concepts like God the number three and goodness are real abstract or both.An approach to resolving such difficulty is to use predicates as a general term for whether things are variously real abstract concrete or of a particular property e.g. good. Questions about the properties of things are then propositions about predicates which propositions remain to be evaluated by the investigator. In the graph  below the graphical relationships like the arrows joining boxes and ellipses might denote predicates.Abstractions sometimes have ambiguous referents; for example happiness when used as an abstraction can refer to as many things as there are people and events or states of being which make them happy. Likewise architecture refers not only to the design of safe functional buildings but also to elements of creation and innovation which aim at elegant solutions to construction problems to the use of space and to the attempt to evoke an emotional response in the builders owners viewers and users of the building.Abstraction uses a strategy of simplification wherein formerly concrete details are left ambiguous vague or undefined; thus effective communication about things in the abstract requires an intuitive or common experience between the communicator and the communication recipient. This is true for all verbal/abstract communication.For example many different things can be red. Likewise many things sit on surfaces as in picture  to the right. The property of redness and the relation sitting-on are therefore abstractions of those objects. Specifically the conceptual diagram graph  identifies only three boxes two ellipses and four arrows and their five labels whereas the picture  shows much more pictorial detail with the scores of implied relationships as implicit in the picture rather than with the nine explicit details in the graph.Graph  details some explicit relationships between the objects of the diagram. For example the arrow between the agent and CAT:Elsie depicts an example of an is-a relationship as does the arrow between the location and the MAT. The arrows between the gerund/present participle SITTING and the nouns agent and location express the diagrams basic relationship; agent is SITTING on location; Elsie is an instance of CAT.Although the description sitting-on graph  is more abstract than the graphic image of a cat sitting on a mat picture  the delineation of abstract things from concrete things is somewhat ambiguous; this ambiguity or vagueness is characteristic of abstraction. Thus something as simple as a newspaper might be specified to six levels as in Douglas Hofstadters illustration of that ambiguity with a progression from abstract to concrete in Gödel Escher Bach :An abstraction can thus encapsulate each of these levels of detail with no loss of generality. But perhaps a detective or philosopher/scientist/engineer might seek to learn about something at progressively deeper levels of detail to solve a crime or a puzzle.In philosophical terminology abstraction is the thought process wherein ideas are distanced from objects.Typically abstraction is used in the arts as a synonym for abstract art in general. Strictly speaking it refers to art unconcerned with the literal depiction of things from the visible world—it can however refer to an object or image which has been distilled from the real world or indeed another work of art. Artwork that reshapes the natural world for expressive purposes is called abstract; that which derives from but does not imitate a recognizable subject is called nonobjective abstraction. In the th century the trend toward abstraction coincided with advances in science technology and changes in urban life eventually reflecting an interest in psychoanalytic theory. Later still abstraction was manifest in more purely formal terms such as color freedom from objective context and a reduction of form to basic geometric designs.Computer scientists use abstraction to make models that can be used and re-used without having to re-write all the program code for each new application on every different type of computer. They communicate their solutions with the computer by writing source code in some particular computer language which can be translated into machine code for different types of computers to execute. Abstraction allows program designers to separate a framework categorical concepts related to computing problems from specific instances which implement details. This means that the program code can be written so that code doesnt have to depend on the specific details of supporting applications operating system software or hardware but on a categorical concept of the solution. A solution to the problem can then be integrated into the system framework with minimal additional work. This allows programmers to take advantage of another programmers work while requiring only an abstract understanding of the implementation of anothers work apart from the problem that it solves.Abstractions and levels of abstraction play an important role in the theory of general semantics originated by Alfred Korzybski. Anatol Rapoport wrote: Abstracting is a mechanism by which an infinite variety of experiences can be mapped on short noises words.Francis Fukuyama defines history as a deliberate attempt of abstraction in which we separate out important from unimportant events.Researchers in linguistics frequently apply abstraction so as to allow analysis of the phenomena of language at the desired level of detail. A commonly used abstraction the phoneme abstracts speech sounds in such a way as to neglect details that cannot serve to differentiate meaning. Other analogous kinds of abstractions sometimes called emic units considered by linguists include morphemes graphemes and lexemes.Abstraction also arises in the relation between syntax semantics and pragmatics. Pragmatics involves considerations that make reference to the user of the language; semantics considers expressions and what they denote the designata abstracted from the language user; and syntax considers only the expressions themselves abstracted from the designata.Abstraction in mathematics is the process of extracting the underlying structures patterns or properties of a mathematical concept or object removing any dependence on real world objects with which it might originally have been connected and generalizing it so that it has wider applications or matching among other abstract descriptions of equivalent phenomena.The advantages of abstraction in mathematics are:It reveals deep connections between different areas of mathematics.Known results in one area can suggest conjectures in another related area.Techniques and methods from one area can be applied to prove results in other related area.Patterns from one mathematical object can be generalized to other similar objects in the same class.The main disadvantage of abstraction is that highly abstract concepts are more difficult to learn and might require a degree of mathematical maturity and experience before they can be assimilated.In music the term abstraction can be used to describe improvisatory approaches to interpretation and may sometimes indicate abandonment of tonality. Atonal music has no key signature and is characterized by the exploration of internal numeric relationships.Further information: Intelligence Mental rotation and Mental operationsA recent meta-analysis suggests that the verbal system has greater engagement for abstract concepts when the perceptual system is more engaged for processing of concrete concepts. This is because abstract concepts elicit greater brain activity in the inferior frontal gyrus and middle temporal gyrus compared to concrete concepts which elicit greater activity in the posterior cingulate precuneus fusiform gyrus and parahippocampal gyrus. Other research into the human brain suggests that the left and right hemispheres differ in their handling of abstraction. For example one meta-analysis reviewing human brain lesions has shown a left hemisphere bias during tool usage.Abstraction in philosophy is the process or to some the alleged process in concept formation of recognizing some set of common features in individuals and on that basis forming a concept of that feature. The notion of abstraction is important to understanding some philosophical controversies surrounding empiricism and the problem of universals. It has also recently become popular in formal logic under predicate abstraction. Another philosophical tool for discussion of abstraction is thought space.John Locke defined abstraction in An Essay Concerning Human Understanding:So words are used to stand as outward marks of our internal ideas which are taken from particular things; but if every particular idea that we take in had its own special name there would be no end to names. To prevent this the mind makes particular ideas received from particular things become general; which it does by considering them as they are in the mind—mental appearances—separate from all other existences and from the circumstances of real existence such as time place and so on. This procedure is called abstraction. In it an idea taken from a particular thing becomes a general representative of all of the same kind and its name becomes a general name that is applicable to any existing thing that fits that abstract idea. ..Carl Jungs definition of abstraction broadened its scope beyond the thinking process to include exactly four mutually exclusive different complementary psychological functions: sensation intuition feeling and thinking. Together they form a structural totality of the differentiating abstraction process. Abstraction operates in one of these functions when it excludes the simultaneous influence of the other functions and other irrelevancies such as emotion. Abstraction requires selective use of this structural split of abilities in the psyche. The opposite of abstraction is concretism. Abstraction is one of Jungs  definitions in Chapter XI of Psychological Types.There is an abstract thinking just as there is abstract feeling sensation and intuition. Abstract thinking singles out the rational logical qualities ... Abstract feeling does the same with ... its feeling-values. ... I put abstract feelings on the same level as abstract thoughts. ... Abstract sensation would be aesthetic as opposed to sensuous sensation and abstract intuition would be symbolic as opposed to fantastic intuition. Jung  : par. .In social theory abstraction is used as both an ideational and material process. Alfred Sohn-Rethel asked Can there be abstraction other than by thought He used the example of commodity abstraction to show that abstraction occurs in practice as people create systems of abstract exchange that extend beyond the immediate physicality of the object and yet have real and immediate consequences. This work was extended through the Constitutive Abstraction approach of writers associated with the Journal Arena. Two books that have taken this theme of the abstraction of social relations as an organizing process in human history are Nation Formation: Towards a Theory of Abstract Community. and the second volume of Towards a Theory of Abstract Community published in : Globalism Nationalism Tribalism: Bringing Theory Back In – Volume  of Towards a Theory of Abstract Community. These books argue that the nation is an abstract community bringing together strangers who will never meet as such; thus constituting materially real and substantial but abstracted and mediated relations. The books suggest that contemporary processes of globalization and mediatization have contributed to materially abstracting relations between people with major consequences for how we live our lives.It can be easily argued that abstraction is an elementary methodological tool in several disciplines of social science. These disciplines have definite and different man concepts that highlight those aspects of man and his behaviour by idealization that are relevant for the given human science. For example homo sociologicus is the man as sociology abstracts and idealizes it depicting man as a social being. Moreover we could talk about homo cyber sapiens the man who can extend his biologically determined intelligence thanks to new technologies or homo creativus who is simply creative.Abstraction combined with Weberian idealization plays a crucial role in economics. Breaking away from directly experienced reality was a common trend in th century sciences especially physics and this was the effort which was fundamentally determined the way economics tried and still tries to approach the economic aspects of social life. It is abstraction we meet in the case of both Newtons physics and the neoclassical theory since the goal was to grasp the unchangeable and timeless essence of phenomena. For example Newton created the concept of the material point by following the abstraction method so that he abstracted from the dimension and shape of any perceptible object preserving only inertial and translational motion. Material point is the ultimate and common feature of all bodies. Neoclassical economists created the indefinitely abstract notion of homo economicus by following the same procedure. Economists abstract from all individual and personal qualities in order to get to those characteristics that embody the essence of economic activity. Eventually it is the substance of the economic man that they try to grasp. Any characteristic beyond it only disturbs the functioning of this essential core.A picture of a lightbulb is associated to someone having an idea a sign of creativity.Creativity is a phenomenon whereby something new and somehow valuable is formed. The created item may be intangible such as an idea a scientific theory a musical composition or a joke or a physical object such as an invention a printed literary work or a painting.Scholarly interest in creativity is found in a number of disciplines primarily psychology business studies and cognitive science but also education technology engineering philosophy particularly philosophy of science theology sociology linguistics economics and mathematics covering the relations between creativity and general intelligence personality type mental and neural processes mental health or artificial intelligence; the potential for fostering creativity through education and training; the fostering of creativity for national economic benefit and the application of creative resources to improve the effectiveness of teaching and learning.The English word creativity comes from the Latin term creare to create make: its derivational suffixes also come from Latin. The word create appeared in English as early as the th century notably in Chaucer to indicate divine creation in The Parsons TaleHowever its modern meaning as an act of human creation did not emerge until after the Enlightenment.In a summary of scientific research into creativity Michael Mumford suggested: Over the course of the last decade however we seem to have reached a general agreement that creativity involves the production of novel useful products Mumford  p.  or in Robert Sternbergs words the production of something original and worthwhile. Authors have diverged dramatically in their precise definitions beyond these general commonalities: Peter Meusburger reckons that over a hundred different analyses can be found in the literature. As an illustration one definition given by Dr. E. Paul Torrance described it as a process of becoming sensitive to problems deficiencies gaps in knowledge missing elements disharmonies and so on; identifying the difficulty; searching for solutions making guesses or formulating hypotheses about the deficiencies: testing and retesting these hypotheses and possibly modifying and retesting them; and finally communicating the results.Creativity in general is usually distinguished from innovation in particular where the stress is on implementation. For example Teresa Amabile and Pratt  defines creativity as production of novel and useful ideas and innovation as implementation of creative ideas while the OECD and Eurostat state that Innovation is more than a new idea or an invention. An innovation requires implementation either by being put into active use or by being made available for use by other parties firms individuals or organisations.There is also an Emotional creativity EC which is described as a pattern of cognitive abilities and personality traits related to originality and appropriateness in emotional experience. Research has shown emotional creativity is interrelated with the real-life involvement in different types of specific creative leisure activities.Theories of creativity particularly investigation of why some people are more creative than others have focused on a variety of aspects. The dominant factors are usually identified as the four Ps — process product person and place according to Mel Rhodes. A focus on process is shown in cognitive approaches that try to describe thought mechanisms and techniques for creative thinking. Theories invoking divergent rather than convergent thinking such as Guilford or those describing the staging of the creative process such as Wallas are primarily theories of creative process. A focus on creative product usually appears in attempts to measure creativity psychometrics see below and in creative ideas framed as successful memes. The psychometric approach to creativity reveals that it also involves the ability to produce more. A focus on the nature of the creative person considers more general intellectual habits such as openness levels of ideation autonomy expertise exploratory behavior and so on. A focus on place considers the circumstances in which creativity flourishes such as degrees of autonomy access to resources and the nature of gatekeepers. Creative lifestyles are characterized by nonconforming attitudes and behaviors as well as flexibility.Greek philosophers like Plato rejected the concept of creativity preferring to see art as a form of discovery. Asked in The Republic Will we say of a painter that he makes something Plato answers Certainly not he merely imitates.Most ancient cultures including thinkers of Ancient Greece Ancient China and Ancient India lacked the concept of creativity seeing art as a form of discovery and not creation. The ancient Greeks had no terms corresponding to to create or creator except for the expression poiein to make which only applied to poiesis poetry and to the poietes poet or maker who made it. Plato did not believe in art as a form of creation. Asked in The Republic Will we say of a painter that he makes something he answers Certainly not he merely imitates.It is commonly argued that the notion of creativity originated in Western culture through Christianity as a matter of divine inspiration. According to the historian Daniel J. Boorstin the early Western conception of creativity was the Biblical story of creation given in the Genesis. However this is not creativity in the modern sense which did not arise until the Renaissance. In the Judaeo-Christian tradition creativity was the sole province of God; humans were not considered to have the ability to create something new except as an expression of Gods work. A concept similar to that of Christianity existed in Greek culture for instance Muses were seen as mediating inspiration from the Gods. Romans and Greeks invoked the concept of an external creative daemon Greek or genius Latin linked to the sacred or the divine. However none of these views are similar to the modern concept of creativity and the individual was not seen as the cause of creation until the Renaissance. It was during the Renaissance that creativity was first seen not as a conduit for the divine but from the abilities of great men.The rejection of creativity in favor of discovery and the belief that individual creation was a conduit of the divine would dominate the West probably until the Renaissance and even later. The development of the modern concept of creativity begins in the Renaissance when creation began to be perceived as having originated from the abilities of the individual and not God. This could be attributed to the leading intellectual movement of the time aptly named humanism which developed an intensely human-centric outlook on the world valuing the intellect and achievement of the individual. From this philosophy arose the Renaissance man or polymath an individual who embodies the principals of humanism in their ceaseless courtship with knowledge and creation. One of the most well-known and immensely accomplished examples is Leonardo da Vinci.However this shift was gradual and would not become immediately apparent until the Enlightenment. By the th century and the Age of Enlightenment mention of creativity notably in aesthetics linked with the concept of imagination became more frequent. In the writing of Thomas Hobbes imagination became a key element of human cognition; William Duff was one of the first to identify imagination as a quality of genius typifying the separation being made between talent productive but breaking no new ground and genius.As a direct and independent topic of study creativity effectively received no attention until the th century. Runco and Albert argue that creativity as the subject of proper study began seriously to emerge in the late th century with the increased interest in individual differences inspired by the arrival of Darwinism. In particular they refer to the work of Francis Galton who through his eugenicist outlook took a keen interest in the heritability of intelligence with creativity taken as an aspect of genius.In the late th and early th centuries leading mathematicians and scientists such as Hermann von Helmholtz  and Henri Poincaré  began to reflect on and publicly discuss their creative processes.The insights of Poincaré and von Helmholtz were built on in early accounts of the creative process by pioneering theorists such as Graham Wallas and Max Wertheimer. In his work Art of Thought published in  Wallas presented one of the first models of the creative process. In the Wallas stage model creative insights and illuminations may be explained by a process consisting of  stages:i preparation preparatory work on a problem that focuses the individuals mind on the problem and explores the problems dimensionsii incubation where the problem is internalized into the unconscious mind and nothing appears externally to be happeningiii intimation the creative person gets a feeling that a solution is on its wayiv illumination or insight where the creative idea bursts forth from its preconscious processing into conscious awareness;v verification where the idea is consciously verified elaborated and then applied.Wallas model is often treated as four stages with intimation seen as a sub-stage.Wallas considered creativity to be a legacy of the evolutionary process which allowed humans to quickly adapt to rapidly changing environments. Simonton provides an updated perspective on this view in his book Origins of genius: Darwinian perspectives on creativity.In  Alfred North Whitehead gave the Gifford Lectures at the University of Edinburgh later published as Process and Reality. He is credited with having coined the term creativity to serve as the ultimate category of his metaphysical scheme: Whitehead actually coined the term – our term still the preferred currency of exchange among literature science and the arts. . . a term that quickly became so popular so omnipresent that its invention within living memory and by Alfred North Whitehead of all people quickly became occluded.Although psychometric studies of creativity had been conducted by The London School of Psychology as early as  with the work of H. L. Hargreaves into the Faculty of Imagination the formal psychometric measurement of creativity from the standpoint of orthodox psychological literature is usually considered to have begun with J. P. Guilfords address to the American Psychological Association in . The address helped to popularize the study of creativity and to focus attention on scientific approaches to conceptualizing creativity. Statistical analyses led to the recognition of creativity as measured as a separate aspect of human cognition to IQ-type intelligence into which it had previously been subsumed. Guilfords work suggested that above a threshold level of IQ the relationship between creativity and classically measured intelligence broke down.James C. Kaufman and Beghetto introduced a four C model of creativity; mini-c transformative learning involving personally meaningful interpretations of experiences actions and insights little-c everyday problem solving and creative expression Pro-C exhibited by people who are professionally or vocationally creative though not necessarily eminent and Big-C creativity considered great in the given field. This model was intended to help accommodate models and theories of creativity that stressed competence as an essential component and the historical transformation of a creative domain as the highest mark of creativity. It also the authors argued made a useful framework for analyzing creative processes in individuals.The contrast of terms Big C and Little c has been widely used. Kozbelt Beghetto and Runco use a little-c/Big-C model to review major theories of creativity. Margaret Boden distinguishes between h-creativity historical and p-creativity personal.Robinson and Anna Craft have focused on creativity in a general population particularly with respect to education. Craft makes a similar distinction between high and little c creativity. and cites Ken Robinson as referring to high and democratic creativity. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi has defined creativity in terms of those individuals judged to have made significant creative perhaps domain-changing contributions. Simonton has analysed the career trajectories of eminent creative people in order to map patterns and predictors of creative productivity.There has been much empirical study in psychology and cognitive science of the processes through which creativity occurs. Interpretation of the results of these studies has led to several possible explanations of the sources and methods of creativity.Incubation is a temporary break from creative problem solving that can result in insight. There has been some empirical research looking at whether as the concept of incubation in Wallas model implies a period of interruption or rest from a problem may aid creative problem-solving. Ward lists various hypotheses that have been advanced to explain why incubation may aid creative problem-solving and notes how some empirical evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that incubation aids creative problem in that it enables forgetting of misleading clues. Absence of incubation may lead the problem solver to become fixated on inappropriate strategies of solving the problem. This work disputes the earlier hypothesis that creative solutions to problems arise mysteriously from the unconscious mind while the conscious mind is occupied on other tasks. This earlier hypothesis is discussed in Csikszentmihalyis five phase model of the creative process which describes incubation as a time that your unconscious takes over. This allows for unique connections to be made without our consciousness trying to make logical order out of the problem.J. P. Guilford drew a distinction between convergent and divergent production commonly renamed convergent and divergent thinking. Convergent thinking involves aiming for a single correct solution to a problem whereas divergent thinking involves creative generation of multiple answers to a set problem. Divergent thinking is sometimes used as a synonym for creativity in psychology literature. Other researchers have occasionally used the terms flexible thinking or fluid intelligence which are roughly similar to but not synonymous with creativity.In  Finke et al. proposed the Geneplore model in which creativity takes place in two phases: a generative phase where an individual constructs mental representations called preinventive structures and an exploratory phase where those structures are used to come up with creative ideas. Some evidence shows that when people use their imagination to develop new ideas those ideas are heavily structured in predictable ways by the properties of existing categories and concepts. Weisberg argued by contrast that creativity only involves ordinary cognitive processes yielding extraordinary results.Helie and Sun more recently proposed a unified framework for understanding creativity in problem solving namely the Explicit–Implicit Interaction EII theory of creativity. This new theory constitutes an attempt at providing a more unified explanation of relevant phenomena in part by reinterpreting/integrating various fragmentary existing theories of incubation and insight.The EII theory relies mainly on five basic principles namely:The co-existence of and the difference between explicit and implicit knowledge;The simultaneous involvement of implicit and explicit processes in most tasks;The redundant representation of explicit and implicit knowledge;The integration of the results of explicit and implicit processing;The iterative and possibly bidirectional processing.A computational implementation of the theory was developed based on the CLARION cognitive architecture and used to simulate relevant human data. This work represents an initial step in the development of process-based theories of creativity encompassing incubation insight and various other related phenomena.In The Act of Creation Arthur Koestler introduced the concept of bisociation — that creativity arises as a result of the intersection of two quite different frames of reference. This idea was later developed into conceptual blending. In the s various approaches in cognitive science that dealt with metaphor analogy and structure mapping have been converging and a new integrative approach to the study of creativity in science art and humor has emerged under the label conceptual blending.Honing theory developed principally by psychologist Liane Gabora posits that creativity arises due to the self-organizing self-mending nature of a worldview. The creative process is a way in which the individual hones and re-hones an integrated worldview. Honing theory places emphasis not only on the externally visible creative outcome but also the internal cognitive restructuring and repair of the worldview brought about by the creative process. When faced with a creatively demanding task there is an interaction between the conception of the task and the worldview. The conception of the task changes through interaction with the worldview and the worldview changes through interaction with the task. This interaction is reiterated until the task is complete at which point not only is the task conceived of differently but the worldview is subtly or drastically transformed as it follows the natural tendency of a worldview to attempt to resolve dissonance and seek internal consistency amongst its components whether they be ideas attitudes or bits of knowledge.A central feature of honing theory is the notion of a potentiality state. Honing theory posits that creative thought proceeds not by searching through and randomly ‘mutating’ predefined possibilities but by drawing upon associations that exist due to overlap in the distributed neural cell assemblies that participate in the encoding of experiences in memory. Midway through the creative process one may have made associations between the current task and previous experiences but not yet disambiguated which aspects of those previous experiences are relevant to the current task. Thus the creative idea may feel ‘half-baked’. It is at that point that it can be said to be in a potentiality state because how it will actualize depends on the different internally or externally generated contexts it interacts with.Honing theory is held to explain certain phenomena not dealt with by other theories of creativity for example how different works by the same creator are observed in studies to exhibit a recognizable style or voice even though in different creative outlets. This is not predicted by theories of creativity that emphasize chance processes or the accumulation of expertise but it is predicted by honing theory according to which personal style reflects the creators uniquely structured worldview. Another example is in the environmental stimulus for creativity. Creativity is commonly considered to be fostered by a supportive nurturing trustworthy environment conducive to self-actualization. However research shows that creativity is also associated with childhood adversity which would stimulate honing.In everyday thought people often spontaneously imagine alternatives to reality when they think if only.... Their counterfactual thinking is viewed as an example of everyday creative processes. It has been proposed that the creation of counterfactual alternatives to reality depends on similar cognitive processes to rational thought.Holm-Hadulla developed with his colleagues a dialectical theory of creativity. It is an interdisciplinary theory. The dialectical theory of creativity starts with the antique concept that creativity takes place in an interplay between order and chaos. Similar ideas can be found in neurosciences and psychology. Neurobiologically it can be shown that the creative process takes place in a dynamic interplay between coherence and incoherence that leads to new and usable neuronal networks. Psychology shows how the dialectics of convergent and focused thinking with divergent and associative thinking leads to new ideas and products. Also creative personality traits like the ‘Big Five’ seem to be dialectically intertwined in the creative process: emotional instability vs. stability extraversion vs. introversion openness vs. reserve agreeableness vs. antagonism and disinhibition vs. constraint. Holm-Hadulla and colleagues exemplified the dialectics of creative processes and personality traits on behalf of extraordinary personalities like Johann W. v. Goethe Robert Schumann Jim Morrison Madonna Ciccone and Mick Jagger. The dialectical theory of creativity applies also to counseling and psychotherapy.There was a creativity quotient developed similar to the intelligence quotient IQ. It makes use of the results of divergent thinking tests see below by processing them further. It gives more weight to ideas that are radically different from other ideas in the response.J. P. Guilfords group which pioneered the modern psychometric study of creativity constructed several tests to measure creativity in :Plot Titles where participants are given the plot of a story and asked to write original titles.Quick Responses is a word-association test scored for uncommonness.Figure Concepts where participants were given simple drawings of objects and individuals and asked to find qualities or features that are common by two or more drawings; these were scored for uncommonness.Unusual Uses is finding unusual uses for common everyday objects such as bricks.Remote Associations where participants are asked to find a word between two given words e.g. Hand _____ CallRemote Consequences where participants are asked to generate a list of consequences of unexpected events e.g. loss of gravityOriginally Guilford was trying to create a model for intellect as a whole but in doing so also created a model for creativity. Guilford made an important assumption for creative research: creativity isnt one abstract concept.  The idea that creativity is a category rather than one single concept opened up the ability for other researchers to look at creativity with a whole new perspective.Additionally Guilford hypothesized one of the first models for the components of creativity.  He explained that creativity was a result of having:Sensitivity to problems or the ability to recognize problems;Fluency which encompassesa. Ideational fluency or the ability rapidly to produce a variety of ideas that fulfill stated requirements;b. Associational fluency or the ability to generate a list of words each of which is associated with a given word;                    c. Expressional fluency or the ability to organize words into larger units such as phrases sentences and paragraphs;Flexibility which encompasses                      a. Spontaneous flexibility or the ability to demonstrate flexibility;                          b. Adaptive flexibility or the ability to produce responses that are novel and high in quality.This represents the base model by which several researchers would take and alter to produce their new theories of creativity years later. Building on Guilfords work Torrance developed the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking in . They involved simple tests of divergent thinking and other problem-solving skills which were scored on:Fluency – The total number of interpretable meaningful and relevant ideas generated in response to the stimulus.Originality – The statistical rarity of the responses among the test subjects.Elaboration – The amount of detail in the responses.Such tests sometimes called Divergent Thinking DT tests have been both supported and criticized.Considerable progress has been made in automated scoring of divergent thinking tests using semantic approach. When compared to human raters NLP techniques were shown to be reliable and valid in scoring the originality. The reported computer programs were able to achieve a correlation of . and . respectively to human graders.Semantic networks were also used to devise originality scores that yielded significant correlations with socio-personal measures. Most recently an NSF-funded team of researchers led by James C. Kaufman and Mark A. Runco combined expertise in creativity research natural language processing computational linguistics and statistical data analysis to devise a scalable system for computerized automated testing SparcIt Creativity Index Testing system. This system enabled automated scoring of DT tests that is reliable objective and scalable thus addressing most of the issues of DT tests that had been found and reported. The resultant computer system was able to achieve a correlation of . to human graders.Some researchers have taken a social-personality approach to the measurement of creativity. In these studies personality traits such as independence of judgement self-confidence attraction to complexity aesthetic orientation and risk-taking are used as measures of the creativity of individuals. A meta-analysis by Gregory Feist showed that creative people tend to be more open to new experiences less conventional and less conscientious more self-confident self-accepting driven ambitious dominant hostile and impulsive. Openness conscientiousness self-acceptance hostility and impulsivity had the strongest effects of the traits listed. Within the framework of the Big Five model of personality some consistent traits have emerged. Openness to experience has been shown to be consistently related to a whole host of different assessments of creativity. Among the other Big Five traits research has demonstrated subtle differences between different domains of creativity. Compared to non-artists artists tend to have higher levels of openness to experience and lower levels of conscientiousness while scientists are more open to experience conscientious and higher in the confidence-dominance facets of extraversion compared to non-scientists.An alternative is using biographical methods. These methods use quantitative characteristics such as the number of publications patents or performances of a work. While this method was originally developed for highly creative personalities today it is also available as self-report questionnaires supplemented with frequent less outstanding creative behaviors such as writing a short story or creating your own recipes. For example the Creative Achievement Questionnaire a self-report test that measures creative achievement across  domains was described in  and shown to be reliable and valid when compared to other measures of creativity and to independent evaluation of creative output. Besides the English original it was also used in a Chinese French and German-speaking version. It is the self-report questionnaire most frequently used in research.The potential relationship between creativity and intelligence has been of interest since the late s when a multitude of influential studies – from Getzels & Jackson Barron Wallach & Kogan and Guilford – focused not only on creativity but also on intelligence. This joint focus highlights both the theoretical and practical importance of the relationship: researchers are interested not only if the constructs are related but also how and why.There are multiple theories accounting for their relationship with the  main theories as follows:Threshold Theory – Intelligence is a necessary but not sufficient condition for creativity. There is a moderate positive relationship between creativity and intelligence until IQ ~.Certification Theory – Creativity is not intrinsically related to intelligence. Instead individuals are required to meet the requisite level intelligence in order to gain a certain level of education/work which then in turn offers the opportunity to be creative. Displays of creativity are moderated by intelligence.Interference Theory – Extremely high intelligence might interfere with creative ability.Sternberg and O’Hara proposed a framework of  possible relationships between creativity and intelligence:Creativity is a subset of intelligenceIntelligence is a subset of creativityCreativity and intelligence are overlapping constructsCreativity and intelligence are part of the same construct coincident setsCreativity and intelligence are distinct constructs disjoint setsCreativity as a subset of intelligenceA number of researchers include creativity either explicitly or implicitly as a key component of intelligence.Examples of theories that include creativity as a subset of intelligenceSternbergs Theory of Successful intelligence see Triarchic theory of intelligence includes creativity as a main component and comprises  sub-theories: Componential Analytic Contextual Practical and Experiential Creative. Experiential sub-theory – the ability to use pre-existing knowledge and skills to solve new and novel problems – is directly related to creativity.The Cattell–Horn–Carroll theory includes creativity as a subset of intelligence. Specifically it is associated with the broad group factor of long-term storage and retrieval Glr. Glr narrow abilities relating to creativity include: ideational fluency associational fluency and originality/creativity. Silvia et al. conducted a study to look at the relationship between divergent thinking and verbal fluency tests and reported that both fluency and originality in divergent thinking were significantly affected by the broad level Glr factor. Martindale extended the CHC-theory in the sense that it was proposed that those individuals who are creative are also selective in their processing speed Martindale argues that in the creative process larger amounts of information are processed more slowly in the early stages and as the individual begins to understand the problem the processing speed is increased.The Dual Process Theory of Intelligence posits a two-factor/type model of intelligence. Type  is a conscious process and concerns goal directed thoughts which are explained by g. Type  is an unconscious process and concerns spontaneous cognition which encompasses daydreaming and implicit learning ability. Kaufman argues that creativity occurs as a result of Type  and Type  processes working together in combination. The use of each type in the creative process can be used to varying degrees.Intelligence as a subset of creativityIn this relationship model intelligence is a key component in the development of creativity.Sternberg & Lubarts Investment Theory. Using the metaphor of a stock market they demonstrate that creative thinkers are like good investors – they buy low and sell high in their ideas. Like under/low-valued stock creative individuals generate unique ideas that are initially rejected by other people. The creative individual has to persevere and convince the others of the ideas value. After convincing the others and thus increasing the ideas value the creative individual ‘sells high’ by leaving the idea with the other people and moves onto generating another idea. According to this theory six distinct but related elements contribute to successful creativity: intelligence knowledge thinking styles personality motivation and environment. Intelligence is just one of the six factors that can either solely or in conjunction with the other five factors generate creative thoughts.Amabiles Componential Model of Creativity. In this model there are  within-individual components needed for creativity – domain-relevant skills creativity-relevant processes and task motivation – and  component external to the individual: their surrounding social environment. Creativity requires a confluence of all components. High creativity will result when an individual is: intrinsically motivated possesses both a high level of domain-relevant skills and has high skills in creative thinking and is working in a highly creative environment.Amusement Park Theoretical Model. In this -step theory both domain-specific and generalist views are integrated into a model of creativity. The researchers make use of the metaphor of the amusement park to demonstrate that within each of these creative levels intelligence plays a key role:To get into the amusement park there are initial requirements e.g. time/transport to go to the park. Initial requirements like intelligence are necessary but not sufficient for creativity. They are more like prerequisites for creativity and if an individual does not possess the basic level of the initial requirement intelligence then they will not be able to generate creative thoughts/behaviour.Secondly are the subcomponents – general thematic areas – that increase in specificity. Like choosing which type of amusement park to visit e.g. a zoo or a water park these areas relate to the areas in which someone could be creative e.g. poetry.Thirdly there are specific domains. After choosing the type of park to visit e.g. waterpark you then have to choose which specific park to go to. Within the poetry domain there are many different types e.g. free verse riddles sonnet etc. that have to be selected from.Lastly there are micro-domains. These are the specific tasks that reside within each domain e.g. individual lines in a free verse poem / individual rides at the waterpark.Creativity and intelligence as overlapping yet distinct constructsThis possible relationship concerns creativity and intelligence as distinct but intersecting constructs.Renzullis Three-Ring Conception of Giftedness. In this conceptualisation giftedness occurs as a result from the overlap of above average intellectual ability creativity and task commitment. Under this view creativity and intelligence are distinct constructs but they do overlap under the correct conditions.PASS theory of intelligence. In this theory the planning component – relating to the ability to solve problems make decisions and take action – strongly overlaps with the concept of creativity.Threshold Theory TT. A number of previous research findings have suggested that a threshold exists in the relationship between creativity and intelligence – both constructs are moderately positively correlated up to an IQ of ~. Above this threshold of an IQ of  if there is a relationship at all it is small and weak. TT posits that a moderate level of intelligence is necessary for creativity.In support of the TT Barron reported finding a non-significant correlation between creativity and intelligence in a gifted sample; and a significant correlation in a non-gifted sample. Yamamoto in a sample of secondary school children reported a significant correlation between creativity and intelligence of r = . and reported no significant correlation when the sample consisted of gifted children. Fuchs-Beauchamp et al. in a sample of preschoolers found that creativity and intelligence correlated from r = . to r = . in the group of children who had an IQ below the threshold; and in the group above the threshold the correlations were r = <.. Cho et al. reported a correlation of . between creativity and intelligence in the average IQ group of a sample of adolescents and adults; and a correlation of close to r = . for the high IQ group. Jauk et al. found support for the TT but only for measures of creative potential; not creative performance.Much modern day research reports findings against TT. Wai et al. in a study using data from the longitudinal Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth – a cohort of elite students from early adolescence into adulthood – found that differences in SAT scores at age  were predictive of creative real-life outcomes  years later. Kims meta-analysis of  studies did not find any supporting evidence for TT and instead negligible correlations were reported between intelligence creativity and divergent thinking both below and above IQs of . Preckel et al. investigating fluid intelligence and creativity reported small correlations of r = . to r = . across all levels of cognitive ability.Under this view researchers posit that there are no differences in the mechanisms underlying creativity in those used in normal problem solving; and in normal problem solving there is no need for creativity. Thus creativity and Intelligence problem solving are the same thing. Perkins referred to this as the ‘nothing-special’ view.Weisberg & Alba examined problem solving by having participants complete the -dot problem see Thinking outside the box#Nine dots puzzle – where the participants are asked to connect all  dots in the  rows of  dots using  straight lines or less without lifting their pen or tracing the same line twice. The problem can only be solved if the lines go outside the boundaries of the square of dots. Results demonstrated that even when participants were given this insight they still found it difficult to solve the problem thus showing that to successfully complete the task it is not just insight or creativity that is required.In this view creativity and intelligence are completely different unrelated constructs.Getzels and Jackson administered  creativity measures to a group of  children from grades - and compared these test findings to results from previously administered by the school IQ tests. They found that the correlation between the creativity measures and IQ was r = .. The high creativity group scored in the top % of the overall creativity measures but were not included in the top % of IQ scorers. The high intelligence group scored the opposite: they scored in the top % for IQ but were outside the top % scorers for creativity thus showing that creativity and intelligence are distinct and unrelated.However this work has been heavily criticised. Wallach and Kogan highlighted that the creativity measures were not only weakly related to one another to the extent that they were no more related to one another than they were with IQ but they seemed to also draw upon non-creative skills. McNemar noted that there were major measurement issues in that the IQ scores were a mixture from  different IQ tests.Wallach and Kogan administered  measures of creativity each of which resulted in a score for originality and fluency; and  measures of general intelligence to  th grade children. These tests were untimed and given in a game-like manner aiming to facilitate creativity. Inter-correlations between creativity tests were on average r = .. Inter-correlations between intelligence measures were on average r = . with each other. Creativity tests and intelligence measures correlated r = ..distributed functional brain network associated with divergent thinkingThe neuroscience of creativity looks at the operation of the brain during creative behaviour. It has been addressed in the article Creative Innovation: Possible Brain Mechanisms. The authors write that creative innovation might require coactivation and communication between regions of the brain that ordinarily are not strongly connected. Highly creative people who excel at creative innovation tend to differ from others in three ways:they have a high level of specialized knowledgethey are capable of divergent thinking mediated by the frontal lobe.and they are able to modulate neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine in their frontal lobe.Thus the frontal lobe appears to be the part of the cortex that is most important for creativity.This article also explored the links between creativity and sleep mood and addiction disorders and depression.In  Alice Flaherty presented a three-factor model of the creative drive. Drawing from evidence in brain imaging drug studies and lesion analysis she described the creative drive as resulting from an interaction of the frontal lobes the temporal lobes and dopamine from the limbic system. The frontal lobes can be seen as responsible for idea generation and the temporal lobes for idea editing and evaluation. Abnormalities in the frontal lobe such as depression or anxiety generally decrease creativity while abnormalities in the temporal lobe often increase creativity. High activity in the temporal lobe typically inhibits activity in the frontal lobe and vice versa. High dopamine levels increase general arousal and goal directed behaviors and reduce latent inhibition and all three effects increase the drive to generate ideas. A  study on creativity found that it involves the interaction of multiple neural networks including those that support associative thinking along with other default mode network functions.Vandervert described how the brains frontal lobes and the cognitive functions of the cerebellum collaborate to produce creativity and innovation. Vanderverts explanation rests on considerable evidence that all processes of working memory responsible for processing all thought are adaptively modeled for increased efficiency by the cerebellum. The cerebellum consisting of  billion neurons which is more than the entirety of the rest of the brain is also widely known to adaptively model all bodily movement for efficiency. The cerebellums adaptive models of working memory processing are then fed back to especially frontal lobe working memory control processes where creative and innovative thoughts arise. Apparently creative insight or the aha experience is then triggered in the temporal lobe.According to Vandervert the details of creative adaptation begin in forward cerebellar models which are anticipatory/exploratory controls for movement and thought. These cerebellar processing and control architectures have been termed Hierarchical Modular Selection and Identification for Control HMOSAIC. New hierarchically arranged levels of the cerebellar control architecture HMOSAIC develop as mental mulling in working memory is extended over time. These new levels of the control architecture are fed forward to the frontal lobes. Since the cerebellum adaptively models all movement and all levels of thought and emotion Vanderverts approach helps explain creativity and innovation in sports art music the design of video games technology mathematics the child prodigy and thought in general.Essentially Vandervert has argued that when a person is confronted with a challenging new situation visual-spatial working memory and speech-related working memory are decomposed and re-composed fractionated by the cerebellum and then blended in the cerebral cortex in an attempt to deal with the new situation. With repeated attempts to deal with challenging situations the cerebro-cerebellar blending process continues to optimize the efficiency of how working memory deals with the situation or problem. Most recently he has argued that this is the same process only involving visual-spatial working memory and pre-language vocalization that led to the evolution of language in humans. Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers have pointed out that this blending process because it continuously optimizes efficiencies constantly improves prototyping attempts toward the invention or innovation of new ideas music art or technology. Prototyping they argue not only produces new products it trains the cerebro-cerebellar pathways involved to become more efficient at prototyping itself. Further Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers believe that this repetitive mental prototyping or mental rehearsal involving the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex explains the success of the self-driven individualized patterning of repetitions initiated by the teaching methods of the Khan Academy. The model proposed by Vandervert has however received incisive critique from several authors.Creativity involves the forming of associative elements into new combinations that are useful or meet some requirement. Sleep aids this process. REM rather than NREM sleep appears to be responsible. This has been suggested to be due to changes in cholinergic and noradrenergic neuromodulation that occurs during REM sleep. During this period of sleep high levels of acetylcholine in the hippocampus suppress feedback from the hippocampus to the neocortex and lower levels of acetylcholine and norepinephrine in the neocortex encourage the spread of associational activity within neocortical areas without control from the hippocampus. This is in contrast to waking consciousness where higher levels of norepinephrine and acetylcholine inhibit recurrent connections in the neocortex. It is proposed that REM sleep adds creativity by allowing neocortical structures to reorganize associative hierarchies in which information from the hippocampus would be reinterpreted in relation to previous semantic representations or nodes.Some theories suggest that creativity may be particularly susceptible to affective influence. As noted in voting behavior the term affect in this context can refer to liking or disliking key aspects of the subject in question. This work largely follows from findings in psychology regarding the ways in which affective states are involved in human judgment and decision-making.According to Alice Isen positive affect has three primary effects on cognitive activity:Positive affect makes additional cognitive material available for processing increasing the number of cognitive elements available for association;Positive affect leads to defocused attention and a more complex cognitive context increasing the breadth of those elements that are treated as relevant to the problem;Positive affect increases cognitive flexibility increasing the probability that diverse cognitive elements will in fact become associated. Together these processes lead positive affect to have a positive influence on creativity.Barbara Fredrickson in her broaden-and-build model suggests that positive emotions such as joy and love broaden a persons available repertoire of cognitions and actions thus enhancing creativity.According to these researchers positive emotions increase the number of cognitive elements available for association attention scope and the number of elements that are relevant to the problem cognitive scope.Various meta-analyses such as Baas et al.  of  studies about creativity and affect support the link between creativity and positive affect. Research has shown that practicing creative leisure activities is interrelated with the emotional creativity.Jürgen Schmidhubers formal theory of creativity postulates that creativity curiosity and interestingness are by-products of a simple computational principle for measuring and optimizing learning progress. Consider an agent able to manipulate its environment and thus its own sensory inputs. The agent can use a black box optimization method such as reinforcement learning to learn through informed trial and error sequences of actions that maximize the expected sum of its future reward signals. There are extrinsic reward signals for achieving externally given goals such as finding food when hungry. But Schmidhubers objective function to be maximized also includes an additional intrinsic term to model wow-effects. This non-standard term motivates purely creative behavior of the agent even when there are no external goals. A wow-effect is formally defined as follows. As the agent is creating and predicting and encoding the continually growing history of actions and sensory inputs it keeps improving the predictor or encoder which can be implemented as an artificial neural network or some other machine learning device that can exploit regularities in the data to improve its performance over time. The improvements can be measured precisely by computing the difference in computational costs storage size number of required synapses errors time needed to encode new observations before and after learning. This difference depends on the encoders present subjective knowledge which changes over time but the theory formally takes this into account. The cost difference measures the strength of the present wow-effect due to sudden improvements in data compression or computational speed. It becomes an intrinsic reward signal for the action selector. The objective function thus motivates the action optimizer to create action sequences causing more wow-effects. Irregular random data or noise do not permit any wow-effects or learning progress and thus are boring by nature providing no reward. Already known and predictable regularities also are boring. Temporarily interesting are only the initially unknown novel regular patterns in both actions and observations. This motivates the agent to perform continual open-ended active creative exploration. Schmidhubers work is highly influential in intrinsic motivation which has emerged as a research topic in its own right as part of the study of artificial intelligence and robotics.According to Schmidhuber his objective function explains the activities of scientists artists and comedians. For example physicists are motivated to create experiments leading to observations obeying previously unpublished physical laws permitting better data compression. Likewise composers receive intrinsic reward for creating non-arbitrary melodies with unexpected but regular harmonies that permit wow-effects through data compression improvements. Similarly a comedian gets intrinsic reward for inventing a novel joke with an unexpected punch line related to the beginning of the story in an initially unexpected but quickly learnable way that also allows for better compression of the perceived data. Schmidhuber argues that ongoing computer hardware advances will greatly scale up rudimentary artificial scientists and artistsclarification needed based on simple implementations of the basic principle since . He used the theory to create low-complexity art and an attractive human face.A study by psychologist J. Philippe Rushton found creativity to correlate with intelligence and psychoticism. Another study found creativity to be greater in schizotypal than in either normal or schizophrenic individuals. While divergent thinking was associated with bilateral activation of the prefrontal cortex schizotypal individuals were found to have much greater activation of their right prefrontal cortex. This study hypothesizes that such individuals are better at accessing both hemispheres allowing them to make novel associations at a faster rate. In agreement with this hypothesis ambidexterity is also associated with schizotypal and schizophrenic individuals. Three recent studies by Mark Batey and Adrian Furnham have demonstrated the relationships between schizotypal and hypomanic personality and several different measures of creativity.Particularly strong links have been identified between creativity and mood disorders particularly manic-depressive disorder a.k.a. bipolar disorder and depressive disorder a.k.a. unipolar disorder. In Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament Kay Redfield Jamison summarizes studies of mood-disorder rates in writers poets and artists. She also explores research that identifies mood disorders in such famous writers and artists as Ernest Hemingway who shot himself after electroconvulsive treatment Virginia Woolf who drowned herself when she felt a depressive episode coming on composer Robert Schumann who died in a mental institution and even the famed visual artist Michelangelo.A study looking at  persons with schizophrenia bipolar disorder or unipolar depression and their relatives found overrepresentation in creative professions for those with bipolar disorder as well as for undiagnosed siblings of those with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. There was no overall overrepresentation but overrepresentation for artistic occupations among those diagnosed with schizophrenia. There was no association for those with unipolar depression or their relatives.Another study involving more than one million people conducted by Swedish researchers at the Karolinska Institute reported a number of correlations between creative occupations and mental illnesses. Writers had a higher risk of anxiety and bipolar disorders schizophrenia unipolar depression and substance abuse and were almost twice as likely as the general population to kill themselves. Dancers and photographers were also more likely to have bipolar disorder.As a group those in the creative professions were no more likely to have psychiatric disorders than other people although they were more likely to have a close relative with a disorder including anorexia and to some extent autism the Journal of Psychiatric Research reports.According to psychologist Robert Epstein PhD creativity can be obstructed through stress.Conversely research has shown that creative activities such as art therapy poetry writing journaling and reminiscence can promote mental well-being.Creativity can be expressed in a number of different forms depending on unique people and environments. A number of different theorists have suggested models of the creative person. One model suggests that there are four Creativity Profiles that can help produce growth innovation speed etc.i Incubate Long-term Developmentii Imagine Breakthrough Ideasiii Improve Incremental Adjustmentsiv Invest Short-term GoalsResearch by Dr Mark Batey of the Psychometrics at Work Research Group at Manchester Business School has suggested that the creative profile can be explained by four primary creativity traits with narrow facets within eachi Idea Generation Fluency Originality Incubation and Illuminationii Personality Curiosity and Tolerance for Ambiguityiii Motivation Intrinsic Extrinsic and Achievementiv Confidence Producing Sharing and ImplementingThis model was developed in a sample of  working adults using the statistical techniques of Exploratory Factor Analysis followed by Confirmatory Factor Analysis by Structural Equation Modelling.An important aspect of the creativity profiling approach is to account for the tension between predicting the creative profile of an individual as characterised by the psychometric approach and the evidence that team creativity is founded on diversity and difference.One characteristic of creative people as measured by some psychologists is what is called divergent production. Divergent production is the ability of a person to generate a diverse assortment yet an appropriate amount of responses to a given situation. One way of measuring divergent production is by administering the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking. The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking assesses the diversity quantity and appropriateness of participants responses to a variety of open-ended questions.Other researchers of creativity see the difference in creative people as a cognitive process of dedication to problem solving and developing expertise in the field of their creative expression. Hard working people study the work of people before them and within their current area become experts in their fields and then have the ability to add to and build upon previous information in innovative and creative ways. In a study of projects by design students students who had more knowledge on their subject on average had greater creativity within their projects.The aspect of motivation within a persons personality may predict creativity levels in the person. Motivation stems from two different sources intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation is an internal drive within a person to participate or invest as a result of personal interest desires hopes goals etc. Extrinsic motivation is a drive from outside of a person and might take the form of payment rewards fame approval from others etc. Although extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation can both increase creativity in certain cases strictly extrinsic motivation often impedes creativity in people.From a personality-traits perspective there are a number of traits that are associated with creativity in people. Creative people tend to be more open to new experiences are more self-confident are more ambitious self-accepting impulsive driven dominant and hostile compared to people with less creativity.From an evolutionary perspective creativity may be a result of the outcome of years of generating ideas. As ideas are continuously generated the need to evolve produces a need for new ideas and developments. As a result people have been creating and developing new innovative and creative ideas to build our progress as a society.In studying exceptionally creative people in history some common traits in lifestyle and environment are often found. Creative people in history usually had supportive parents but rigid and non-nurturing. Most had an interest in their field at an early age and most had a highly supportive and skilled mentor in their field of interest. Often the field they chose was relatively uncharted allowing for their creativity to be expressed more in a field with less previous information. Most exceptionally creative people devoted almost all of their time and energy into their craft and after about a decade had a creative breakthrough of fame. Their lives were marked with extreme dedication and a cycle of hard-work and breakthroughs as a result of their determination.Another theory of creative people is the investment theory of creativity. This approach suggest that there are many individual and environmental factors that must exist in precise ways for extremely high levels of creativity opposed to average levels of creativity. In the investment sense a person with their particular characteristics in their particular environment may see an opportunity to devote their time and energy into something that has been overlooked by others. The creative person develops an undervalued or under-recognised idea to the point that it is established as a new and creative idea. Just like in the financial world some investments are worth the buy in while others are less productive and do not build to the extent that the investor expected. This investment theory of creativity views creativity in a unique perspective compared to others by asserting that creativity might rely to some extent on the right investment of effort being added to a field at the right time in the right way.So called malevolent creativity is associated with the dark side of creativity. This type of creativity is not typically accepted within society and is defined by the intention to cause harm to others through original and innovative means. Malevolent creativity should be distinguished from negative creativity in that negative creativity may unintentionally cause harm to others whereas malevolent creativity is explicitly malevolently motivated. While it is often associated with criminal behaviour it can also be observed in ordinary day-to-day life as lying cheating and betrayal.Malevolent creativity is often a key contributor to crime and in its most destructive form can even manifest as terrorism. As creativity requires deviating from the conventional there is a permanent tension between being creative and producing products that go too far and in some cases to the point of breaking the law. Aggression is a key predictor of malevolent creativity and studies have also shown that increased levels of aggression also correlates to a higher likelihood of committing crime.Although everyone shows some levels of malevolent creativity under certain conditions those that have a higher propensity towards it have increased tendencies to deceive and manipulate others to their own gain. While malevolent creativity appears to dramatically increase when an individual is placed under unfair conditions personality particularly aggressiveness is also a key predictor in anticipating levels of malevolent thinking. Researchers Harris and Reiter-Palmon investigated the role of aggression in levels of malevolent creativity in particular levels of implicit aggression and the tendency to employ aggressive actions in response to problem solving. The personality traits of physical aggression conscientiousness emotional intelligence and implicit aggression all seem to be related with malevolent creativity. Harris and Reiter-Palmons research showed that when subjects were presented with a problem that triggered malevolent creativity participants high in implicit aggression and low in premeditation expressed the largest number of malevolently-themed solutions. When presented with the more benign problem that triggered prosocial motives of helping others and cooperating those high in implicit aggression even if they were high in impulsiveness were far less destructive in their imagined solutions. They concluded premeditation more than implicit aggression controlled an individuals expression of malevolent creativity.Creativity is viewed differently in different countries. For example cross-cultural research centred on Hong Kong found that Westerners view creativity more in terms of the individual attributes of a creative person such as their aesthetic taste while Chinese people view creativity more in terms of the social influence of creative people e.g. what they can contribute to society. Mpofu et al. surveyed  African languages and found that  had no word which directly translated to creativity the exception being Arabic. The principle of linguistic relativity i.e. that language can affect thought suggests that the lack of an equivalent word for creativity may affect the views of creativity among speakers of such languages. However more research would be needed to establish this and there is certainly no suggestion that this linguistic difference makes people any less or more creative; Africa has a rich heritage of creative pursuits such as music art and storytelling. Nevertheless it is true that there has been very little research on creativity in Africa and there has also been very little research on creativity in Latin America. Creativity has been more thoroughly researched in the northern hemisphere but here again there are cultural differences even between countries or groups of countries in close proximity. For example in Scandinavian countries creativity is seen as an individual attitude which helps in coping with lifes challenges while in Germany creativity is seen more as a process that can be applied to help solve problems.Training meeting in an eco-design stainless steel company in Brazil. The leaders among other things wish to cheer and encourage the workers in order to achieve a higher level of creativity.It has been the topic of various research studies to establish that organizational effectiveness depends on the creativity of the workforce to a large extent. For any given organization measures of effectiveness vary depending upon its mission environmental context nature of work the product or service it produces and customer demands. Thus the first step in evaluating organizational effectiveness is to understand the organization itself — how it functions how it is structured and what it emphasizes.Amabile argued that to enhance creativity in business three components were needed:Expertise technical procedural and intellectual knowledgeCreative thinking skills how flexibly and imaginatively people approach problemsand Motivation especially intrinsic motivation.There are two types of motivation:extrinsic motivation – external factors for example threats of being fired or money as a rewardintrinsic motivation – comes from inside an individual satisfaction enjoyment of work etc.Six managerial practices to encourage motivation are:Challenge – matching people with the right assignments;Freedom – giving people autonomy choosing means to achieve goals;Resources – such as time money space etc. There must be balance fit among resources and people;Work group features – diverse supportive teams where members share the excitement willingness to help and recognize each others talents;Supervisory encouragement – recognitions cheering praising;Organizational support – value emphasis information sharing collaboration.Nonaka who examined several successful Japanese companies similarly saw creativity and knowledge creation as being important to the success of organizations. In particular he emphasized the role that tacit knowledge has to play in the creative process.In business originality is not enough. The idea must also be appropriate—useful and actionable. Creative competitive intelligence is a new solution to solve this problem. According to Reijo Siltala it links creativity to innovation process and competitive intelligence to creative workers.Creativity can be encouraged in people and professionals and in the workplace. It is essential for innovation and is a factor affecting economic growth and businesses. In  the sociologist Silvia Leal Martín using the Innova DX method suggested measuring the various parameters that encourage creativity and innovation: corporate culture work environment leadership and management creativity self-esteem and optimism locus of control and learning orientation motivation and fear.Similarly social psychologists organizational scientists and management scientists who conduct extensive research on the factors that influence creativity and innovation in teams and organizations have developed integrative theoretical models that emphasize the roles of team composition team processes and organizational culture as well as the mutually reinforcing relationships between them in promoting innovation.The investigation by Loo   on creative working in the knowledge economy brings together studies of creativity as delineated in this web page. It offers connections with the sections on the ‘”Four C” model’ ‘Theories of creative processes’ ‘Creativity as a subset of intelligence’ ‘Creativity and personality’ and ‘In organisations’ It is the last section that the investigation addresses.Research studies of the knowledge economy may be classified into three levels: macro meso and micro. Macro studies refer to investigations at a societal or transnational dimension. Meso studies focus on organisations. Micro investigations centre on the minutiae workings of workers. There is also an interdisciplinary dimension such as research from businesses e.g. Burton-Jones ; Drucker  economics e.g. Cortada ; Reich ; Florida  education e.g. Farrell and Fenwick ; Brown Lauder and Ashton  human resource management e.g. Davenport  knowledge and organizational management Alvesson ; Defillippi Arthur and Lindsay ; Orr Nutley Russell Bain Hacking and Moran  sociology psychology and knowledge economy-related sectors – especially information technology IT software e.g. O’Riain ; Nerland  and advertising e.g. Grabher ; Lury  Loo .Loo  studies how individual workers in the knowledge economy use their creativity and know-how in the advertising and IT software sectors. It examines this phenomenon across three developed countries of England Japan and Singapore to observe global perspectives. Specifically the study uses qualitative data from semi-structured interviews of the related professionals in the roles of creative directing and copywriting in advertising and systems software developing and software programme managing.The study offers a conceptual framework Loo  p.  of a two-dimensional matrix of individual and collaborative working styles and single and multi-contexts. The investigation draws on literature sources from the four disciplines of economics e.g. Reich ; Quah  management e.g. Drucker ; Nonaka and Takeuchi ; von Hippel  sociology e.g. Zuboff ; Bell ; Lash and Urry ; Castells ; Knorr Cetina  and psychology e.g. Gardner ; Csikszentmihalyi ; Sternberg Kaufman and Pretz . The themes arising from the analysis of knowledge work and creativity literature serve to create a distinct theoretical framework of creative knowledge work. These workers apply their cognitive abilities creative personalities and skill sets in the areas of science technology or culture industries to invent or discover new possibilities – e.g. a medium product or service. These work activities may be done individually or collectively. Education training and ‘encultured environments’ are necessary for the performance of these creative activities. Acts of creativity are viewed as asking new questions over and above those questions asked by an intelligent person seeking novelty when reviewing a situation Gardner  and creating something that is different and novel i.e. a ‘variation’ on the idea of existing ideas in a domain Csikszentmihalyi . This framework is evidenced by the empirical chapters on the micro-workings of creative workers in the two knowledge economy sectors from global perspectives.This investigation identifies a definition of creative work three types of work and the necessary conditions for it to occur. These workers use a combination of creative applications including anticipatory imagination problem-solving problem seeking and generating ideas and aesthetic sensibilities. Taking aesthetic sensibilities as an example for a creative director in the advertising industry it is a visual imagery whether still or moving via a camera lens and for a software programmer it is the innovative technical expertise in which the software is written. There are specific creative applications for each of the sectors such as emotional connection in the advertising sector and the power of expression and sensitivity in the IT software sector. In addition to the creative applications creative workers require abilities and aptitudes to carry out their roles. Passion for ones job is generic. For copywriters this passion is identified with fun enjoyment and happiness alongside attributes such as honesty regarding the product confidence and patience in finding the appropriate copy. Knowledge is also required in the disciplines of the humanities e.g. literature the creative arts e.g. painting and music and technical-related know-how e.g. mathematics computer sciences and physical sciences. In the IT software technical knowledge of computer languages e.g. C++ is especially significant for programmers whereas the degree of technical expertise may be less for a programme manager as only knowledge of the relevant language is necessary to understand the issues for communicating with the team of developers and testers.There are three types of work. One is intra-sectoral e.g. ‘general sponge’ and ’in tune with the zeitgeist’ advertising and ‘power of expression’ and ‘sensitivity’ IT software. The second is inter-sectoral e.g. ‘integration of advertising activities’ advertising and ‘autonomous decentralized systems’ ADS IT software. The third relates to changes in culture/practices in the sectors e.g. ‘three-dimensional trust’ and ‘green credentials’ advertising and ‘collaboration with HEIs and industry’ and ‘ADS system in the Tokyo train operator’ IT software.The necessary conditions for creative work to exist are a supportive environment such as supportive information communications and electronic technologies ICET infrastructure training work environment and education.This investigation has implications for lifelong learning of these workers informally and formally. Teaching institutions need to offer multi-disciplinary knowledge of humanities arts and sciences and it has impacts on the programme structure delivery approaches and assessments. At a macro level governments need to offer a rich diet of cultural activities outdoor activities and sports fixtures that inform potential creative workers in the areas of video gaming and advertising. This study has implications for work organisations that support and encourage collaborative working alongside individual working offer opportunities to engage in continuous professional development formally and informally and foster an environment which promotes experiential functioning and supports experimentation.Diversity between team members’ backgrounds and knowledge can increase team creativity by expanding the total collection of unique information that is available to the team and introducing different perspectives that can integrate in novel ways. However under some conditions diversity can also decrease team creativity by making it more difficult for team members to communicate about ideas and causing interpersonal conflicts between those with different perspectives. Thus the potential advantages of diversity must be supported by appropriate team processes and organizational cultures in order to enhance creativity.Team communication norms such as respecting others’ expertise paying attention to others’ ideas expecting information sharing tolerating disagreements negotiating remaining open to others’ ideas learning from others and building on each others ideas increase team creativity by facilitating the social processes involved with brainstorming and problem solving. Through these processes team members are able to access their collective pool of knowledge reach shared understandings identify new ways of understanding problems or tasks and make new connections between ideas. Engaging in these social processes also promotes positive team affect which facilitates collective creativity.Supportive and motivational environments that create psychological safety by encouraging risk taking and tolerating mistakes increase team creativity as well. Organizations in which help-seeking help giving and collaboration are rewarded promote innovation by providing opportunities and contexts in which team processes that lead to collective creativity can occur. Additionally leadership styles that downplay status hierarchies or power differences within an organization and empower people to speak up about their ideas or opinions also help to create cultures that are conducive to creativity.There is a long-standing debate on how material constraints e.g. lack of money materials or equipment affect creativity. In psychological and managerial research two competing views in this regard prevail. In one view many scholars propose a negative effect of material constraints on innovation and claim that material constraints starve creativity. The proponents of this view argue that adequate material resources are needed to engage in creative activities like experimenting with new solutions and idea exploration. In an opposing view scholars assert that people tend to stick to established routines or solutions as long as they are not forced to deviate from them by constraints. In this sense Neren posits that scarcity is an important driver of creativity. Consistently Gibbert and Scranton demonstrated how material constraints facilitated the development of jet engines in World War II.To reconcile these competing views contingency models were proposed. The rationale behind these models is that certain contingency factors e.g. creativity climate or creativity relevant skills influence the relationship between constraints and creativity. These contingency factors reflect the need for higher levels of motivation and skills when working on creative tasks under constraints. Depending on these contingency factors there is either a positive or negative relationship between constraints and creativity.Economic approaches to creativity have focussed on three aspects — the impact of creativity on economic growth methods of modelling markets for creativity and the maximisation of economic creativity innovation.In the early th century Joseph Schumpeter introduced the economic theory of creative destruction to describe the way in which old ways of doing things are endogenously destroyed and replaced by the new. Some economists such as Paul Romer view creativity as an important element in the recombination of elements to produce new technologies and products and consequently economic growth. Creativity leads to capital and creative products are protected by intellectual property laws.Mark A. Runco and Daniel Rubenson have tried to describe a psychoeconomic model of creativity. In such a model creativity is the product of endowments and active investments in creativity; the costs and benefits of bringing creative activity to market determine the supply of creativity. Such an approach has been criticised for its view of creativity consumption as always having positive utility and for the way it analyses the value of future innovations.The creative class is seen by some to be an important driver of modern economies. In his  book The Rise of the Creative Class economist Richard Florida popularized the notion that regions with  Ts of economic development: Technology Talent and Tolerance also have high concentrations of creative professionals and tend to have a higher level of economic development.Several different researchers have proposed methods of increasing the creativity of an individual. Such ideas range from the psychological-cognitive such as Osborn-Parnes Creative Problem Solving Process Synectics science-based creative thinking Purdue Creative Thinking Program and Edward de Bonos lateral thinking; to the highly structured such as TRIZ the Theory of Inventive Problem-Solving and its variant Algorithm of Inventive Problem Solving developed by the Russian scientist Genrich Altshuller and Computer-Aided morphological analysis.Daniel Pink in his  book A Whole New Mind repeating arguments posed throughout the th century argues that we are entering a new age where creativity is becoming increasingly important. In this conceptual age we will need to foster and encourage right-directed thinking representing creativity and emotion over left-directed thinking representing logical analytical thought. However this simplification of right versus left brain thinking is not supported by the research data.Nickerson provides a summary of the various creativity techniques that have been proposed. These include approaches that have been developed by both academia and industry:Establishing purpose and intentionBuilding basic skillsEncouraging acquisitions of domain-specific knowledgeStimulating and rewarding curiosity and explorationBuilding motivation especially internal motivationEncouraging confidence and a willingness to take risksFocusing on mastery and self-competitionPromoting supportable beliefs about creativityProviding opportunities for choice and discoveryDeveloping self-management metacognitive skillsTeaching techniques and strategies for facilitating creative performanceProviding balanceManaging the need for closureExperiments suggest the need for closure of task participants whether as a reflection of personality or induced through time pressure negatively impacts creativity. Accordingly it has been suggested that reading fiction which can reduce the cognitive need for closure may help to encourage creativity.Some see the conventional system of schooling as stifling of creativity and attempt particularly in the preschool/kindergarten and early school years to provide a creativity-friendly rich imagination-fostering environment for young children. Researchers have seen this as important because technology is advancing our society at an unprecedented rate and creative problem solving will be needed to cope with these challenges as they arise. In addition to helping with problem solving creativity also helps students identify problems where others have failed to do so. See the Waldorf School as an example of an education program that promotes creative thought.Promoting intrinsic motivation and problem solving are two areas where educators can foster creativity in students. Students are more creative when they see a task as intrinsically motivating valued for its own sake. To promote creative thinking educators need to identify what motivates their students and structure teaching around it. Providing students with a choice of activities to complete allows them to become more intrinsically motivated and therefore creative in completing the tasks.Teaching students to solve problems that do not have well defined answers is another way to foster their creativity. This is accomplished by allowing students to explore problems and redefine them possibly drawing on knowledge that at first may seem unrelated to the problem in order to solve it. In adults mentoring individuals is another way to foster their creativiy. However the benefits of mentoring creativity apply only to creative contributions considered great in a given field not to everyday creative expression.In the Scottish education system creativity is identified as a core skillset for learning life and work and is defined as “a process which generates ideas that have value to the individual. It involves looking at familiar things with a fresh eye examining problems with an open mind making connections learning from mistakes and using imagination to explore new possibilities.”  The need to develop a shared language and understanding of creativity and its role across every aspect of learning teaching and continuous improvement was identified as a necessary aim  and a set of four skills is used to allow educators to discuss and develop creativity skills across all subjects and sectors of education – curiosity open—mindedness imagination and problem solving.  Distinctions are made between creative learning when learners are using their creativity skills creative teaching when educators are using their creativity skills and creative change when creativity skills are applied to planning and improvement.  Scotlands national Creative Learning Plan  supports the development of creativity skills in all learners and of educators’ expertise in developing creativity skills. A range of resources have been created to support and assess this  including a national review of creativity across learning by Her Majestys Inspectorate for Education. Danah Zohar coined the term spiritual intelligence and introduced the idea in  in her book ReWiring the Corporate Brain.In the same year  Ken ODonnell an Australian author and consultant living in Brazil also introduced the term spiritual intelligence in his book Endoquality - the emotional and spiritual dimensions of the human being in organizations.In  in the book Spiritual Intelligence author Steven Benedict outlined the concept as a perspective offering a way to bring together the spiritual and the material that is ultimately concerned with the well-being of the universe and all who live there.Howard Gardner the originator of the theory of multiple intelligences chose not to include spiritual intelligence in his intelligences due to the challenge of codifying quantifiable scientific criteria. Instead Gardner suggested an existential intelligence as viable. However contemporary researchers continue to explore the viability of Spiritual Intelligence often abbreviated as SQ and to create tools for measuring and developing it. So far measurement of spiritual intelligence has tended to rely on self-assessment instruments which can be susceptible to false or unreliable reporting.Variations of spiritual intelligence are sometimes used in corporate settings as a means of motivating employees. and providing a non-religious diversity-sensitive framework for addressing issues of values in the workplace. According to Stephen Covey Spiritual intelligence is the central and most fundamental of all the intelligences because it becomes the source of guidance for the others.Definitions of spiritual intelligence rely on the concept of spirituality as being distinct from religiosity - existential intelligence.Danah Zohar defined  principles underlying spiritual intelligence:Self-awareness: Knowing what I believe in and value and what deeply motivates me.Spontaneity: Living in and being responsive to the moment.Being vision- and value-led: Acting from principles and deep beliefs and living accordingly.Holism: Seeing larger patterns relationships and connections; having a sense of belonging.Compassion: Having the quality of feeling-with and deep empathy.Celebration of diversity: Valuing other people for their differences not despite them.Field independence: Standing against the crowd and having ones own convictions.Humility: Having the sense of being a player in a larger drama of ones true place in the world.Tendency to ask fundamental Why questions: Needing to understand things and get to the bottom of them.Ability to reframe: Standing back from a situation or problem and seeing the bigger picture or wider context.Positive use of adversity: Learning and growing from mistakes setbacks and suffering.Sense of vocation: Feeling called upon to serve to give something back.Ken ODonnell advocates the integration of spiritual intelligence SQ with both rational intelligence IQ and emotional intelligence EQ. IQ helps us to interact with numbers formulas and things EQ helps us to interact with people and SQ helps us to maintain inner balance. To calculate ones level of SQ he suggests the following criteria:How much time money and energy and thoughts do we need to obtain a desired result.How much bilateral respect there exists in our relationships.How clean a game we play with others.How much dignity we retain in respecting the dignity of others.How tranquil we remain in spite of the workload.How sensible our decisions are.How stable we remain in upsetting situations.How easily we see virtues in others instead of defects.Robert Emmons defines spiritual intelligence as the adaptive use of spiritual information to facilitate everyday problem solving and goal attainment. He originally proposed  components of spiritual intelligence:The capacity to transcend the physical and material.The ability to experience heightened states of consciousness.The ability to sanctify everyday experience.The ability to utilize spiritual resources to solve problems.The capacity to be virtuous.Higher Level of Intelligence and self awareness.Early MaturingControl over emotions.The fifth capacity was later removed due to its focus on human behavior rather than ability thereby not meeting previously established scientific criteria for intelligence.Frances Vaughan offers the following description: Spiritual intelligence is concerned with the inner life of mind and spirit and its relationship to being in the world.Cindy Wigglesworth defines spiritual intelligence as the ability to act with wisdom and compassion while maintaining inner and outer peace regardless of the circumstances. She breaks down the competencies that comprise SQ into  skills arranged into a four quadrant model similar to Daniel Golemans widely used model of emotional intelligence or EQ. The four quadrants of spiritual intelligence are defined as:David B. King has undertaken research on spiritual intelligence at Trent University in Peterborough Ontario Canada. King defines spiritual intelligence as a set of adaptive mental capacities based on non-material and transcendent aspects of reality specifically those that:...contribute to the awareness integration and adaptive application of the nonmaterial and transcendent aspects of ones existence leading to such outcomes as deep existential reflection enhancement of meaning recognition of a transcendent self and mastery of spiritual states.King further proposes four core abilities or capacities of spiritual intelligence:Critical Existential Thinking: The capacity to critically contemplate the nature of existence reality the universe space time and other existential/metaphysical issues; also the capacity to contemplate non-existential issues in relation to ones existence i.e. from an existential perspective.Personal Meaning Production: The ability to derive personal meaning and purpose from all physical and mental experiences including the capacity to create and master a life purpose.Transcendental Awareness: The capacity to identify transcendent dimensions/patterns of the self i.e. a transpersonal or transcendent self of others and of the physical world e.g. nonmaterialism during normal states of consciousness accompanied by the capacity to identify their relationship to ones self and to the physical.Conscious State Expansion: The ability to enter and exit higher states of consciousness e.g. pure consciousness cosmic consciousness unity oneness and other states of trance at ones own discretion as in deep contemplation meditation prayer etc..Also Vineeth V. Kumar and Manju Mehta have also researched the concept extensively. Operationalizing the construct they defined spiritual intelligence as the capacity of an individual to possess a socially relevant purpose in life by understanding self and having a high degree of conscience compassion and commitment to human values.Measurement of spiritual intelligence relies on self-reporting. David King and Teresa L. DeCicco have developed a self-report measure the Spiritual Intelligence Self-Report Inventory SISRI- with psychometric and statistical support across two large university samples. Cindy Wigglesworth has developed the SQ a self-assessment inventory that has tested positively for criterion validity and construct validity in statistically significant samples. Wigglesworths SQ model and assessment instrument have been successfully used in corporate settings.The Scale for Spiritual Intelligence SSI; Kumar & Mehta  is a -item self-report measure of spiritual intelligence in adolescents. The idea behind the development of this scale was to generate and assess the concept of spiritual intelligence in the collectivist culture bounded with eastern philosophy. The SSI is rated on a Likert scale and can be completed in  minutes. The -item Spiritual Intelligence Questionnaire:This test was normalized by Abdollahzadeh with the collaboration of Mahdieh Kashmiri and Fatemeh Arabameri on students. The normal group was  people  of whom were the students of Gorgan University of Natural Resources and  students of Payame Noor University of Behshahr. Of these  were female and  were male. First a -item questionnaire was prepared by the test developers and implemented on  students.The reliability of the test in the initial phase was . by the alpha method. In the analysis of the question by Loop method  questions were removed and the final questionnaire was adjusted with  phrases. At the final stage the questionnaire was implemented on  subjects and the reliability was . at this stage. Factor analysis was used to evaluate validity in addition to formal content validity that the questions were confirmed by the experts colleagues and the correlation of all questions was higher than .. In Varimax rotation two major factors were found to reduce variables. The first factor with  question was called understanding and communicating with the source of universe” and the second factor with  items was called “spiritual life or reliance on the inner core. The first factor included the questions             and the second factor included the questions                 . It has been argued that Spiritual Intelligence cannot be recognized as a form of intelligence. Howard Gardner originator of multiple intelligence theory chose not to include spiritual intelligence amongst his intelligences due to the challenge of codifying quantifiable scientific criteria. Later Gardner suggested an existential intelligence as viable but argued that it was better toput aside the term spiritual with its manifest and problematic connotations and to speak instead of an intelligence that explores the nature of existence in its multifarious guises. Thus an explicit concern with spiritual or religious matters would be one variety — often the most important variety — of an existential intelligence.PREFACESUPPOSING that Truth is a woman--what then Is there not groundfor suspecting that all philosophers in so far as they have beendogmatists have failed to understand women--that the terribleseriousness and clumsy importunity with which they have usually paidtheir addresses to Truth have been unskilled and unseemly methods forwinning a woman Certainly she has never allowed herself to be won; andat present every kind of dogma stands with sad and discouraged mien--IFindeed it stands at all! For there are scoffers who maintain that ithas fallen that all dogma lies on the ground--nay more that it is atits last gasp. But to speak seriously there are good grounds for hopingthat all dogmatizing in philosophy whatever solemn whatever conclusiveand decided airs it has assumed may have been only a noble puerilismand tyronism; and probably the time is at hand when it will be onceand again understood WHAT has actually sufficed for the basis of suchimposing and absolute philosophical edifices as the dogmatists havehitherto reared: perhaps some popular superstition of immemorial timesuch as the soul-superstition which in the form of subject- andego-superstition has not yet ceased doing mischief: perhaps someplay upon words a deception on the part of grammar or anaudacious generalization of very restricted very personal veryhuman--all-too-human facts. The philosophy of the dogmatists it is tobe hoped was only a promise for thousands of years afterwards as wasastrology in still earlier times in the service of which probably morelabour gold acuteness and patience have been spent than on anyactual science hitherto: we owe to it and to its super-terrestrialpretensions in Asia and Egypt the grand style of architecture. It seemsthat in order to inscribe themselves upon the heart of humanity witheverlasting claims all great things have first to wander about theearth as enormous and awe-inspiring caricatures: dogmatic philosophy hasbeen a caricature of this kind--for instance the Vedanta doctrine inAsia and Platonism in Europe. Let us not be ungrateful to it althoughit must certainly be confessed that the worst the most tiresomeand the most dangerous of errors hitherto has been a dogmatisterror--namely Platos invention of Pure Spirit and the Good in Itself.But now when it has been surmounted when Europe rid of this nightmarecan again draw breath freely and at least enjoy a healthier--sleepwe WHOSE DUTY IS WAKEFULNESS ITSELF are the heirs of all the strengthwhich the struggle against this error has fostered. It amounted tothe very inversion of truth and the denial of the PERSPECTIVE--thefundamental condition--of life to speak of Spirit and the Good as Platospoke of them; indeed one might ask as a physician: How did such amalady attack that finest product of antiquity Plato Had the wickedSocrates really corrupted him Was Socrates after all a corrupter ofyouths and deserved his hemlock But the struggle against Platoor--to speak plainer and for the people--the struggle againstthe ecclesiastical oppression of millenniums of Christianity FORCHRISTIANITY IS PLATONISM FOR THE PEOPLE produced in Europea magnificent tension of soul such as had not existed anywherepreviously; with such a tensely strained bow one can now aim at thefurthest goals. As a matter of fact the European feels this tension asa state of distress and twice attempts have been made in grand style tounbend the bow: once by means of Jesuitism and the second time by meansof democratic enlightenment--which with the aid of liberty of the pressand newspaper-reading might in fact bring it about that the spiritwould not so easily find itself in distress! The Germans inventedgunpowder--all credit to them! but they again made things square--theyinvented printing. But we who are neither Jesuits nor democratsnor even sufficiently Germans we GOOD EUROPEANS and free VERY freespirits--we have it still all the distress of spirit and all thetension of its bow! And perhaps also the arrow the duty and whoknows THE GOAL TO AIM AT....Sils Maria Upper Engadine JUNE .CHAPTER I. PREJUDICES OF PHILOSOPHERS. The Will to Truth which is to tempt us to many a hazardousenterprise the famous Truthfulness of which all philosophers havehitherto spoken with respect what questions has this Will to Truth notlaid before us! What strange perplexing questionable questions! It isalready a long story; yet it seems as if it were hardly commenced. Isit any wonder if we at last grow distrustful lose patience and turnimpatiently away That this Sphinx teaches us at last to ask questionsourselves WHO is it really that puts questions to us here WHAT reallyis this Will to Truth in us In fact we made a long halt at thequestion as to the origin of this Will--until at last we came to anabsolute standstill before a yet more fundamental question. We inquiredabout the VALUE of this Will. Granted that we want the truth: WHY NOTRATHER untruth And uncertainty Even ignorance The problem of thevalue of truth presented itself before us--or was it we who presentedourselves before the problem Which of us is the Oedipus here Whichthe Sphinx It would seem to be a rendezvous of questions and notes ofinterrogation. And could it be believed that it at last seems to us asif the problem had never been propounded before as if we were the firstto discern it get a sight of it and RISK RAISING it For there is riskin raising it perhaps there is no greater risk.. HOW COULD anything originate out of its opposite For example truthout of error or the Will to Truth out of the will to deception or thegenerous deed out of selfishness or the pure sun-bright vision of thewise man out of covetousness Such genesis is impossible; whoever dreamsof it is a fool nay worse than a fool; things of the highestvalue must have a different origin an origin of THEIR own--in thistransitory seductive illusory paltry world in this turmoil ofdelusion and cupidity they cannot have their source. But rather inthe lap of Being in the intransitory in the concealed God in theThing-in-itself--THERE must be their source and nowhere else!--Thismode of reasoning discloses the typical prejudice by whichmetaphysicians of all times can be recognized this mode of valuationis at the back of all their logical procedure; through this belief oftheirs they exert themselves for their knowledge for something thatis in the end solemnly christened the Truth. The fundamental belief ofmetaphysicians is THE BELIEF IN ANTITHESES OF VALUES. It never occurredeven to the wariest of them to doubt here on the very threshold wheredoubt however was most necessary; though they had made a solemnvow DE OMNIBUS DUBITANDUM. For it may be doubted firstly whetherantitheses exist at all; and secondly whether the popular valuationsand antitheses of value upon which metaphysicians have set theirseal are not perhaps merely superficial estimates merely provisionalperspectives besides being probably made from some corner perhaps frombelow--frog perspectives as it were to borrow an expression currentamong painters. In spite of all the value which may belong to the truethe positive and the unselfish it might be possible that a higherand more fundamental value for life generally should be assigned topretence to the will to delusion to selfishness and cupidity. Itmight even be possible that WHAT constitutes the value of those good andrespected things consists precisely in their being insidiouslyrelated knotted and crocheted to these evil and apparently opposedthings--perhaps even in being essentially identical with them. Perhaps!But who wishes to concern himself with such dangerous Perhapses!For that investigation one must await the advent of a new order ofphilosophers such as will have other tastes and inclinations thereverse of those hitherto prevalent--philosophers of the dangerousPerhaps in every sense of the term. And to speak in all seriousness Isee such new philosophers beginning to appear.. Having kept a sharp eye on philosophers and having read betweentheir lines long enough I now say to myself that the greater part ofconscious thinking must be counted among the instinctive functions andit is so even in the case of philosophical thinking; one has here tolearn anew as one learned anew about heredity and innateness. Aslittle as the act of birth comes into consideration in the whole processand procedure of heredity just as little is being-conscious OPPOSEDto the instinctive in any decisive sense; the greater part of theconscious thinking of a philosopher is secretly influenced by hisinstincts and forced into definite channels. And behind all logic andits seeming sovereignty of movement there are valuations or to speakmore plainly physiological demands for the maintenance of a definitemode of life For example that the certain is worth more than theuncertain that illusion is less valuable than truth such valuationsin spite of their regulative importance for US might notwithstanding beonly superficial valuations special kinds of _niaiserie_ such as maybe necessary for the maintenance of beings such as ourselves. Supposingin effect that man is not just the measure of things.. The falseness of an opinion is not for us any objection to it: it ishere perhaps that our new language sounds most strangely. Thequestion is how far an opinion is life-furthering life-preservingspecies-preserving perhaps species-rearing and we are fundamentallyinclined to maintain that the falsest opinions to which the syntheticjudgments a priori belong are the most indispensable to us thatwithout a recognition of logical fictions without a comparison ofreality with the purely IMAGINED world of the absolute and immutablewithout a constant counterfeiting of the world by means of numbersman could not live--that the renunciation of false opinions would bea renunciation of life a negation of life. TO RECOGNISE UNTRUTH AS ACONDITION OF LIFE; that is certainly to impugn the traditional ideas ofvalue in a dangerous manner and a philosophy which ventures to do sohas thereby alone placed itself beyond good and evil.. That which causes philosophers to be regarded half-distrustfullyand half-mockingly is not the oft-repeated discovery how innocent theyare--how often and easily they make mistakes and lose their way inshort how childish and childlike they are--but that there is notenough honest dealing with them whereas they all raise a loud andvirtuous outcry when the problem of truthfulness is even hinted at inthe remotest manner. They all pose as though their real opinions hadbeen discovered and attained through the self-evolving of a cold puredivinely indifferent dialectic in contrast to all sorts of mysticswho fairer and foolisher talk of inspiration whereas in fact aprejudiced proposition idea or suggestion which is generallytheir hearts desire abstracted and refined is defended by them witharguments sought out after the event. They are all advocates who do notwish to be regarded as such generally astute defenders also of theirprejudices which they dub truths--and VERY far from having theconscience which bravely admits this to itself very far from havingthe good taste of the courage which goes so far as to let this beunderstood perhaps to warn friend or foe or in cheerful confidenceand self-ridicule. The spectacle of the Tartuffery of old Kant equallystiff and decent with which he entices us into the dialecticby-ways that lead more correctly mislead to his categoricalimperative--makes us fastidious ones smile we who find no smallamusement in spying out the subtle tricks of old moralists and ethicalpreachers. Or still more so the hocus-pocus in mathematical form bymeans of which Spinoza has as it were clad his philosophy in mail andmask--in fact the love of HIS wisdom to translate the term fairlyand squarely--in order thereby to strike terror at once into the heartof the assailant who should dare to cast a glance on that invinciblemaiden that Pallas Athene:--how much of personal timidity andvulnerability does this masquerade of a sickly recluse betray!. It has gradually become clear to me what every great philosophy uptill now has consisted of--namely the confession of its originator anda species of involuntary and unconscious auto-biography; and moreoverthat the moral or immoral purpose in every philosophy has constitutedthe true vital germ out of which the entire plant has always grown.Indeed to understand how the abstrusest metaphysical assertions of aphilosopher have been arrived at it is always well and wise to firstask oneself: What morality do they or does he aim at AccordinglyI do not believe that an impulse to knowledge is the father ofphilosophy; but that another impulse here as elsewhere has only madeuse of knowledge and mistaken knowledge! as an instrument. But whoeverconsiders the fundamental impulses of man with a view to determininghow far they may have here acted as INSPIRING GENII or as demons andcobolds will find that they have all practiced philosophy at one timeor another and that each one of them would have been only too glad tolook upon itself as the ultimate end of existence and the legitimateLORD over all the other impulses. For every impulse is imperious and asSUCH attempts to philosophize. To be sure in the case of scholars inthe case of really scientific men it may be otherwise--better ifyou will; there there may really be such a thing as an impulse toknowledge some kind of small independent clock-work which when wellwound up works away industriously to that end WITHOUT the rest ofthe scholarly impulses taking any material part therein. The actualinterests of the scholar therefore are generally in quite anotherdirection--in the family perhaps or in money-making or in politics;it is in fact almost indifferent at what point of research his littlemachine is placed and whether the hopeful young worker becomes agood philologist a mushroom specialist or a chemist; he is notCHARACTERISED by becoming this or that. In the philosopher on thecontrary there is absolutely nothing impersonal; and above allhis morality furnishes a decided and decisive testimony as to WHO HEIS--that is to say in what order the deepest impulses of his naturestand to each other.. How malicious philosophers can be! I know of nothing more stingingthan the joke Epicurus took the liberty of making on Plato and thePlatonists; he called them Dionysiokolakes. In its original senseand on the face of it the word signifies Flatterers ofDionysius--consequently tyrants accessories and lick-spittles;besides this however it is as much as to say They are all ACTORSthere is nothing genuine about them for Dionysiokolax was a popularname for an actor. And the latter is really the malignant reproach thatEpicurus cast upon Plato: he was annoyed by the grandiose manner themise en scene style of which Plato and his scholars were masters--ofwhich Epicurus was not a master! He the old school-teacher of Samoswho sat concealed in his little garden at Athens and wrote threehundred books perhaps out of rage and ambitious envy of Plato whoknows! Greece took a hundred years to find out who the garden-godEpicurus really was. Did she ever find out. There is a point in every philosophy at which the conviction ofthe philosopher appears on the scene; or to put it in the words of anancient mystery:Adventavit asinus Pulcher et fortissimus.. You desire to LIVE according to Nature Oh you noble Stoics whatfraud of words! Imagine to yourselves a being like Nature boundlesslyextravagant boundlessly indifferent without purpose or considerationwithout pity or justice at once fruitful and barren and uncertain:imagine to yourselves INDIFFERENCE as a power--how COULD you livein accordance with such indifference To live--is not that justendeavouring to be otherwise than this Nature Is not living valuingpreferring being unjust being limited endeavouring to be differentAnd granted that your imperative living according to Nature meansactually the same as living according to life--how could you doDIFFERENTLY Why should you make a principle out of what you yourselvesare and must be In reality however it is quite otherwise with you:while you pretend to read with rapture the canon of your law in Natureyou want something quite the contrary you extraordinary stage-playersand self-deluders! In your pride you wish to dictate your morals andideals to Nature to Nature herself and to incorporate them therein;you insist that it shall be Nature according to the Stoa and wouldlike everything to be made after your own image as a vast eternalglorification and generalism of Stoicism! With all your love for truthyou have forced yourselves so long so persistently and with suchhypnotic rigidity to see Nature FALSELY that is to say Stoicallythat you are no longer able to see it otherwise--and to crown all someunfathomable superciliousness gives you the Bedlamite hope thatBECAUSE you are able to tyrannize over yourselves--Stoicism isself-tyranny--Nature will also allow herself to be tyrannized over: isnot the Stoic a PART of Nature... But this is an old and everlastingstory: what happened in old times with the Stoics still happens todayas soon as ever a philosophy begins to believe in itself. It alwayscreates the world in its own image; it cannot do otherwise; philosophyis this tyrannical impulse itself the most spiritual Will to Power thewill to creation of the world the will to the causa prima.. The eagerness and subtlety I should even say craftiness withwhich the problem of the real and the apparent world is dealt with atpresent throughout Europe furnishes food for thought and attention; andhe who hears only a Will to Truth in the background and nothing elsecannot certainly boast of the sharpest ears. In rare and isolatedcases it may really have happened that such a Will to Truth--a certainextravagant and adventurous pluck a metaphysicians ambition of theforlorn hope--has participated therein: that which in the end alwaysprefers a handful of certainty to a whole cartload of beautifulpossibilities; there may even be puritanical fanatics of consciencewho prefer to put their last trust in a sure nothing rather than in anuncertain something. But that is Nihilism and the sign of a despairingmortally wearied soul notwithstanding the courageous bearing such avirtue may display. It seems however to be otherwise with strongerand livelier thinkers who are still eager for life. In that they sideAGAINST appearance and speak superciliously of perspective inthat they rank the credibility of their own bodies about as low as thecredibility of the ocular evidence that the earth stands still andthus apparently allowing with complacency their securest possessionto escape for what does one at present believe in more firmly thanin ones body--who knows if they are not really trying to win backsomething which was formerly an even securer possession somethingof the old domain of the faith of former times perhaps the immortalsoul perhaps the old God in short ideas by which they could livebetter that is to say more vigorously and more joyously than bymodern ideas There is DISTRUST of these modern ideas in this modeof looking at things a disbelief in all that has been constructedyesterday and today; there is perhaps some slight admixture of satietyand scorn which can no longer endure the BRIC-A-BRAC of ideas of themost varied origin such as so-called Positivism at present throws onthe market; a disgust of the more refined taste at the village-fairmotleyness and patchiness of all these reality-philosophasters in whomthere is nothing either new or true except this motleyness. Therein itseems to me that we should agree with those skeptical anti-realists andknowledge-microscopists of the present day; their instinct which repelsthem from MODERN reality is unrefuted... what do their retrogradeby-paths concern us! The main thing about them is NOT that they wishto go back but that they wish to get AWAY therefrom. A little MOREstrength swing courage and artistic power and they would be OFF--andnot back!. It seems to me that there is everywhere an attempt at present todivert attention from the actual influence which Kant exercised onGerman philosophy and especially to ignore prudently the value whichhe set upon himself. Kant was first and foremost proud of his Table ofCategories; with it in his hand he said: This is the most difficultthing that could ever be undertaken on behalf of metaphysics. Let usonly understand this could be! He was proud of having DISCOVERED anew faculty in man the faculty of synthetic judgment a priori. Grantingthat he deceived himself in this matter; the development and rapidflourishing of German philosophy depended nevertheless on his pride andon the eager rivalry of the younger generation to discover if possiblesomething--at all events new faculties--of which to be stillprouder!--But let us reflect for a moment--it is high time to do so.How are synthetic judgments a priori POSSIBLE Kant asks himself--andwhat is really his answer BY MEANS OF A MEANS faculty--butunfortunately not in five words but so circumstantially imposinglyand with such display of German profundity and verbal flourishes thatone altogether loses sight of the comical niaiserie allemande involvedin such an answer. People were beside themselves with delight over thisnew faculty and the jubilation reached its climax when Kant furtherdiscovered a moral faculty in man--for at that time Germans were stillmoral not yet dabbling in the Politics of hard fact. Then camethe honeymoon of German philosophy. All the young theologians of theTubingen institution went immediately into the groves--all seeking forfaculties. And what did they not find--in that innocent rich andstill youthful period of the German spirit to which Romanticism themalicious fairy piped and sang when one could not yet distinguishbetween finding and inventing! Above all a faculty for thetranscendental; Schelling christened it intellectual intuitionand thereby gratified the most earnest longings of the naturallypious-inclined Germans. One can do no greater wrong to the whole ofthis exuberant and eccentric movement which was really youthfulnessnotwithstanding that it disguised itself so boldly in hoary and senileconceptions than to take it seriously or even treat it with moralindignation. Enough however--the world grew older and the dreamvanished. A time came when people rubbed their foreheads and they stillrub them today. People had been dreaming and first and foremost--oldKant. By means of a means faculty--he had said or at least meant tosay. But is that--an answer An explanation Or is it not rather merelya repetition of the question How does opium induce sleep By means ofa means faculty namely the virtus dormitiva replies the doctor inMoliere    Quia est in eo virtus dormitiva    Cujus est natura sensus assoupire.But such replies belong to the realm of comedy and it is high timeto replace the Kantian question How are synthetic judgments a PRIORIpossible by another question Why is belief in such judgmentsnecessary--in effect it is high time that we should understandthat such judgments must be believed to be true for the sake of thepreservation of creatures like ourselves; though they still mightnaturally be false judgments! Or more plainly spoken and roughly andreadily--synthetic judgments a priori should not be possible at all;we have no right to them; in our mouths they are nothing but falsejudgments. Only of course the belief in their truth is necessary asplausible belief and ocular evidence belonging to the perspective viewof life. And finally to call to mind the enormous influence whichGerman philosophy--I hope you understand its right to inverted commasgoosefeet--has exercised throughout the whole of Europe there isno doubt that a certain VIRTUS DORMITIVA had a share in it; thanks toGerman philosophy it was a delight to the noble idlers the virtuousthe mystics the artiste the three-fourths Christians and thepolitical obscurantists of all nations to find an antidote to the stilloverwhelming sensualism which overflowed from the last century intothis in short--sensus assoupire..... As regards materialistic atomism it is one of the best-refutedtheories that have been advanced and in Europe there is now perhapsno one in the learned world so unscholarly as to attach serioussignification to it except for convenient everyday use as anabbreviation of the means of expression--thanks chiefly to the PoleBoscovich: he and the Pole Copernicus have hitherto been the greatestand most successful opponents of ocular evidence. For while Copernicushas persuaded us to believe contrary to all the senses that the earthdoes NOT stand fast Boscovich has taught us to abjure the belief in thelast thing that stood fast of the earth--the belief in substance inmatter in the earth-residuum and particle-atom: it is the greatesttriumph over the senses that has hitherto been gained on earth. Onemust however go still further and also declare war relentless warto the knife against the atomistic requirements which still lead adangerous after-life in places where no one suspects them like the morecelebrated metaphysical requirements: one must also above all givethe finishing stroke to that other and more portentous atomism whichChristianity has taught best and longest the SOUL-ATOMISM. Let it bepermitted to designate by this expression the belief which regards thesoul as something indestructible eternal indivisible as a monadas an atomon: this belief ought to be expelled from science! Betweenourselves it is not at all necessary to get rid of the soul therebyand thus renounce one of the oldest and most venerated hypotheses--ashappens frequently to the clumsiness of naturalists who can hardlytouch on the soul without immediately losing it. But the way is openfor new acceptations and refinements of the soul-hypothesis; and suchconceptions as mortal soul and soul of subjective multiplicityand soul as social structure of the instincts and passions wanthenceforth to have legitimate rights in science. In that the NEWpsychologist is about to put an end to the superstitions which havehitherto flourished with almost tropical luxuriance around the idea ofthe soul he is really as it were thrusting himself into a new desertand a new distrust--it is possible that the older psychologists had amerrier and more comfortable time of it; eventually however he findsthat precisely thereby he is also condemned to INVENT--and who knowsperhaps to DISCOVER the new.. Psychologists should bethink themselves before putting down theinstinct of self-preservation as the cardinal instinct of an organicbeing. A living thing seeks above all to DISCHARGE its strength--lifeitself is WILL TO POWER; self-preservation is only one of the indirectand most frequent RESULTS thereof. In short here as everywhere elselet us beware of SUPERFLUOUS teleological principles!--one of whichis the instinct of self-preservation we owe it to Spinozasinconsistency. It is thus in effect that method ordains which mustbe essentially economy of principles.. It is perhaps just dawning on five or six minds that naturalphilosophy is only a world-exposition and world-arrangement accordingto us if I may say so! and NOT a world-explanation; but in so far asit is based on belief in the senses it is regarded as more and for along time to come must be regarded as more--namely as an explanation.It has eyes and fingers of its own it has ocular evidence andpalpableness of its own: this operates fascinatingly persuasively andCONVINCINGLY upon an age with fundamentally plebeian tastes--in fact itfollows instinctively the canon of truth of eternal popular sensualism.What is clear what is explained Only that which can be seen andfelt--one must pursue every problem thus far. Obversely however thecharm of the Platonic mode of thought which was an ARISTOCRATIC modeconsisted precisely in RESISTANCE to obvious sense-evidence--perhapsamong men who enjoyed even stronger and more fastidious senses than ourcontemporaries but who knew how to find a higher triumph in remainingmasters of them: and this by means of pale cold grey conceptionalnetworks which they threw over the motley whirl of the senses--themob of the senses as Plato said. In this overcoming of the world andinterpreting of the world in the manner of Plato there was an ENJOYMENTdifferent from that which the physicists of today offer us--and likewisethe Darwinists and anti-teleologists among the physiological workerswith their principle of the smallest possible effort and the greatestpossible blunder. Where there is nothing more to see or to grasp thereis also nothing more for men to do--that is certainly an imperativedifferent from the Platonic one but it may notwithstanding be the rightimperative for a hardy laborious race of machinists and bridge-buildersof the future who have nothing but ROUGH work to perform.. To study physiology with a clear conscience one must insist onthe fact that the sense-organs are not phenomena in the sense of theidealistic philosophy; as such they certainly could not be causes!Sensualism therefore at least as regulative hypothesis if not asheuristic principle. What And others say even that the external worldis the work of our organs But then our body as a part of this externalworld would be the work of our organs! But then our organs themselveswould be the work of our organs! It seems to me that this is acomplete REDUCTIO AD ABSURDUM if the conception CAUSA SUI is somethingfundamentally absurd. Consequently the external world is NOT the workof our organs--. There are still harmless self-observers who believe that there areimmediate certainties; for instance I think or as the superstitionof Schopenhauer puts it I will; as though cognition here got holdof its object purely and simply as the thing in itself without anyfalsification taking place either on the part of the subject or theobject. I would repeat it however a hundred times that immediatecertainty as well as absolute knowledge and the thing in itselfinvolve a CONTRADICTIO IN ADJECTO; we really ought to free ourselvesfrom the misleading significance of words! The people on their part maythink that cognition is knowing all about things but the philosophermust say to himself: When I analyze the process that is expressed inthe sentence I think I find a whole series of daring assertions theargumentative proof of which would be difficult perhaps impossible:for instance that it is _I_ who think that there must necessarily besomething that thinks that thinking is an activity and operation on thepart of a being who is thought of as a cause that there is an egoand finally that it is already determined what is to be designated bythinking--that I KNOW what thinking is. For if I had not already decidedwithin myself what it is by what standard could I determine whetherthat which is just happening is not perhaps willing or feeling Inshort the assertion I think assumes that I COMPARE my state at thepresent moment with other states of myself which I know in order todetermine what it is; on account of this retrospective connection withfurther knowledge it has at any rate no immediate certainty forme.--In place of the immediate certainty in which the people maybelieve in the special case the philosopher thus finds a series ofmetaphysical questions presented to him veritable conscience questionsof the intellect to wit: Whence did I get the notion of thinkingWhy do I believe in cause and effect What gives me the right to speakof an ego and even of an ego as cause and finally of an egoas cause of thought He who ventures to answer these metaphysicalquestions at once by an appeal to a sort of INTUITIVE perception likethe person who says I think and know that this at least istrue actual and certain--will encounter a smile and two notes ofinterrogation in a philosopher nowadays. Sir the philosopher willperhaps give him to understand it is improbable that you are notmistaken but why should it be the truth. With regard to the superstitions of logicians I shall never tireof emphasizing a small terse fact which is unwillingly recognized bythese credulous minds--namely that a thought comes when it wishesand not when I wish; so that it is a PERVERSION of the facts of thecase to say that the subject I is the condition of the predicatethink. ONE thinks; but that this one is precisely the famous oldego is to put it mildly only a supposition an assertion andassuredly not an immediate certainty. After all one has even gone toofar with this one thinks--even the one contains an INTERPRETATION ofthe process and does not belong to the process itself. One infers hereaccording to the usual grammatical formula--To think is an activity;every activity requires an agency that is active; consequently... Itwas pretty much on the same lines that the older atomism sought besidesthe operating power the material particle wherein it resides and outof which it operates--the atom. More rigorous minds however learnt atlast to get along without this earth-residuum and perhaps some day weshall accustom ourselves even from the logicians point of view toget along without the little one to which the worthy old ego hasrefined itself.. It is certainly not the least charm of a theory that it isrefutable; it is precisely thereby that it attracts the more subtleminds. It seems that the hundred-times-refuted theory of the free willowes its persistence to this charm alone; some one is always appearingwho feels himself strong enough to refute it.. Philosophers are accustomed to speak of the will as though it werethe best-known thing in the world; indeed Schopenhauer has given usto understand that the will alone is really known to us absolutely andcompletely known without deduction or addition. But it again andagain seems to me that in this case Schopenhauer also only did whatphilosophers are in the habit of doing--he seems to have adopted aPOPULAR PREJUDICE and exaggerated it. Willing seems to me to be aboveall something COMPLICATED something that is a unity only in name--andit is precisely in a name that popular prejudice lurks which has gotthe mastery over the inadequate precautions of philosophers in all ages.So let us for once be more cautious let us be unphilosophical: letus say that in all willing there is firstly a plurality of sensationsnamely the sensation of the condition AWAY FROM WHICH we go thesensation of the condition TOWARDS WHICH we go the sensation of thisFROM and TOWARDS itself and then besides an accompanying muscularsensation which even without our putting in motion arms and legscommences its action by force of habit directly we will anything.Therefore just as sensations and indeed many kinds of sensations areto be recognized as ingredients of the will so in the second placethinking is also to be recognized; in every act of the will there isa ruling thought;--and let us not imagine it possible to sever thisthought from the willing as if the will would then remain over!In the third place the will is not only a complex of sensation andthinking but it is above all an EMOTION and in fact the emotion of thecommand. That which is termed freedom of the will is essentially theemotion of supremacy in respect to him who must obey: I am free hemust obey--this consciousness is inherent in every will; and equallyso the straining of the attention the straight look which fixes itselfexclusively on one thing the unconditional judgment that this andnothing else is necessary now the inward certainty that obediencewill be rendered--and whatever else pertains to the position of thecommander. A man who WILLS commands something within himself whichrenders obedience or which he believes renders obedience. But now letus notice what is the strangest thing about the will--this affair soextremely complex for which the people have only one name. Inasmuch asin the given circumstances we are at the same time the commanding ANDthe obeying parties and as the obeying party we know the sensations ofconstraint impulsion pressure resistance and motion which usuallycommence immediately after the act of will; inasmuch as on the otherhand we are accustomed to disregard this duality and to deceiveourselves about it by means of the synthetic term I: a whole seriesof erroneous conclusions and consequently of false judgments about thewill itself has become attached to the act of willing--to such a degreethat he who wills believes firmly that willing SUFFICES for action.Since in the majority of cases there has only been exercise of willwhen the effect of the command--consequently obedience and thereforeaction--was to be EXPECTED the APPEARANCE has translated itself intothe sentiment as if there were a NECESSITY OF EFFECT; in a word he whowills believes with a fair amount of certainty that will and action aresomehow one; he ascribes the success the carrying out of the willingto the will itself and thereby enjoys an increase of the sensationof power which accompanies all success. Freedom of Will--that is theexpression for the complex state of delight of the person exercisingvolition who commands and at the same time identifies himself withthe executor of the order--who as such enjoys also the triumph overobstacles but thinks within himself that it was really his own willthat overcame them. In this way the person exercising volition adds thefeelings of delight of his successful executive instruments the usefulunderwills or under-souls--indeed our body is but a social structurecomposed of many souls--to his feelings of delight as commander. LEFFETCEST MOI. what happens here is what happens in every well-constructedand happy commonwealth namely that the governing class identifiesitself with the successes of the commonwealth. In all willing it isabsolutely a question of commanding and obeying on the basis asalready said of a social structure composed of many souls on whichaccount a philosopher should claim the right to include willing-as-suchwithin the sphere of morals--regarded as the doctrine of the relationsof supremacy under which the phenomenon of life manifests itself.. That the separate philosophical ideas are not anything optional orautonomously evolving but grow up in connection and relationship witheach other that however suddenly and arbitrarily they seem to appearin the history of thought they nevertheless belong just as much toa system as the collective members of the fauna of a Continent--isbetrayed in the end by the circumstance: how unfailingly the mostdiverse philosophers always fill in again a definite fundamental schemeof POSSIBLE philosophies. Under an invisible spell they always revolveonce more in the same orbit however independent of each other theymay feel themselves with their critical or systematic wills somethingwithin them leads them something impels them in definite order theone after the other--to wit the innate methodology and relationshipof their ideas. Their thinking is in fact far less a discovery than are-recognizing a remembering a return and a home-coming to a far-offancient common-household of the soul out of which those ideas formerlygrew: philosophizing is so far a kind of atavism of the highest order.The wonderful family resemblance of all Indian Greek and Germanphilosophizing is easily enough explained. In fact where there isaffinity of language owing to the common philosophy of grammar--I meanowing to the unconscious domination and guidance of similar grammaticalfunctions--it cannot but be that everything is prepared at the outsetfor a similar development and succession of philosophical systemsjust as the way seems barred against certain other possibilities ofworld-interpretation. It is highly probable that philosophers within thedomain of the Ural-Altaic languages where the conception of the subjectis least developed look otherwise into the world and will befound on paths of thought different from those of the Indo-Germans andMussulmans the spell of certain grammatical functions is ultimatelyalso the spell of PHYSIOLOGICAL valuations and racial conditions.--Somuch by way of rejecting Lockes superficiality with regard to theorigin of ideas.. The CAUSA SUI is the best self-contradiction that has yet beenconceived it is a sort of logical violation and unnaturalness; but theextravagant pride of man has managed to entangle itself profoundly andfrightfully with this very folly. The desire for freedom of willin the superlative metaphysical sense such as still holds swayunfortunately in the minds of the half-educated the desire to bearthe entire and ultimate responsibility for ones actions oneself andto absolve God the world ancestors chance and society therefrominvolves nothing less than to be precisely this CAUSA SUI and withmore than Munchausen daring to pull oneself up into existence by thehair out of the slough of nothingness. If any one should find out inthis manner the crass stupidity of the celebrated conception of freewill and put it out of his head altogether I beg of him to carryhis enlightenment a step further and also put out of his head thecontrary of this monstrous conception of free will: I mean non-freewill which is tantamount to a misuse of cause and effect. Oneshould not wrongly MATERIALISE cause and effect as the naturalphilosophers do and whoever like them naturalize in thinking atpresent according to the prevailing mechanical doltishness which makesthe cause press and push until it effects its end; one should usecause and effect only as pure CONCEPTIONS that is to say asconventional fictions for the purpose of designation and mutualunderstanding--NOT for explanation. In being-in-itself there isnothing of casual-connection of necessity or of psychologicalnon-freedom; there the effect does NOT follow the cause there lawdoes not obtain. It is WE alone who have devised cause sequencereciprocity relativity constraint number law freedom motiveand purpose; and when we interpret and intermix this symbol-worldas being-in-itself with things we act once more as we have alwaysacted--MYTHOLOGICALLY. The non-free will is mythology; in real lifeit is only a question of STRONG and WEAK wills.--It is almost alwaysa symptom of what is lacking in himself when a thinker in everycausal-connection and psychological necessity manifests somethingof compulsion indigence obsequiousness oppression and non-freedom;it is suspicious to have such feelings--the person betrays himself. Andin general if I have observed correctly the non-freedom of the willis regarded as a problem from two entirely opposite standpoints butalways in a profoundly PERSONAL manner: some will not give up theirresponsibility their belief in THEMSELVES the personal right toTHEIR merits at any price the vain races belong to this class; otherson the contrary do not wish to be answerable for anything or blamedfor anything and owing to an inward self-contempt seek to GET OUT OFTHE BUSINESS no matter how. The latter when they write books arein the habit at present of taking the side of criminals; a sort ofsocialistic sympathy is their favourite disguise. And as a matter offact the fatalism of the weak-willed embellishes itself surprisinglywhen it can pose as la religion de la souffrance humaine; that is ITSgood taste.. Let me be pardoned as an old philologist who cannot desist fromthe mischief of putting his finger on bad modes of interpretation butNatures conformity to law of which you physicists talk so proudlyas though--why it exists only owing to your interpretation and badphilology. It is no matter of fact no text but rather just anaively humanitarian adjustment and perversion of meaning with whichyou make abundant concessions to the democratic instincts of the modernsoul! Everywhere equality before the law--Nature is not different inthat respect nor better than we: a fine instance of secret motivein which the vulgar antagonism to everything privileged andautocratic--likewise a second and more refined atheism--is once moredisguised. Ni dieu ni maitre--that also is what you want; andtherefore Cheers for natural law!--is it not so But as has beensaid that is interpretation not text; and somebody might come alongwho with opposite intentions and modes of interpretation could readout of the same Nature and with regard to the same phenomena justthe tyrannically inconsiderate and relentless enforcement of the claimsof power--an interpreter who should so place the unexceptionalness andunconditionalness of all Will to Power before your eyes that almostevery word and the word tyranny itself would eventually seemunsuitable or like a weakening and softening metaphor--as being toohuman; and who should nevertheless end by asserting the same aboutthis world as you do namely that it has a necessary and calculablecourse NOT however because laws obtain in it but because they areabsolutely LACKING and every power effects its ultimate consequencesevery moment. Granted that this also is only interpretation--and youwill be eager enough to make this objection--well so much the better.. All psychology hitherto has run aground on moral prejudices andtimidities it has not dared to launch out into the depths. In so faras it is allowable to recognize in that which has hitherto been writtenevidence of that which has hitherto been kept silent it seems as ifnobody had yet harboured the notion of psychology as the Morphologyand DEVELOPMENT-DOCTRINE OF THE WILL TO POWER as I conceive of it.The power of moral prejudices has penetrated deeply into the mostintellectual world the world apparently most indifferent andunprejudiced and has obviously operated in an injurious obstructiveblinding and distorting manner. A proper physio-psychology has tocontend with unconscious antagonism in the heart of the investigatorit has the heart against it even a doctrine of the reciprocalconditionalness of the good and the bad impulses causes asrefined immorality distress and aversion in a still strong and manlyconscience--still more so a doctrine of the derivation of all goodimpulses from bad ones. If however a person should regard eventhe emotions of hatred envy covetousness and imperiousnessas life-conditioning emotions as factors which must be presentfundamentally and essentially in the general economy of life whichmust therefore be further developed if life is to be furtherdeveloped he will suffer from such a view of things as fromsea-sickness. And yet this hypothesis is far from being the strangestand most painful in this immense and almost new domain of dangerousknowledge and there are in fact a hundred good reasons why every oneshould keep away from it who CAN do so! On the other hand if one hasonce drifted hither with ones bark well! very good! now let us set ourteeth firmly! let us open our eyes and keep our hand fast on the helm!We sail away right OVER morality we crush out we destroy perhaps theremains of our own morality by daring to make our voyage thither--butwhat do WE matter. Never yet did a PROFOUNDER world of insight revealitself to daring travelers and adventurers and the psychologist whothus makes a sacrifice--it is not the sacrifizio dell intellettoon the contrary!--will at least be entitled to demand in return thatpsychology shall once more be recognized as the queen of the sciencesfor whose service and equipment the other sciences exist. For psychologyis once more the path to the fundamental problems.CHAPTER II. THE FREE SPIRIT. O sancta simplicitiatas! In what strange simplification andfalsification man lives! One can never cease wondering when once one hasgot eyes for beholding this marvel! How we have made everything aroundus clear and free and easy and simple! how we have been able to giveour senses a passport to everything superficial our thoughts a godlikedesire for wanton pranks and wrong inferences!--how from the beginningwe have contrived to retain our ignorance in order to enjoy an almostinconceivable freedom thoughtlessness imprudence heartinessand gaiety--in order to enjoy life! And only on this solidifiedgranite-like foundation of ignorance could knowledge rear itselfhitherto the will to knowledge on the foundation of a far more powerfulwill the will to ignorance to the uncertain to the untrue! Not asits opposite but--as its refinement! It is to be hoped indeed thatLANGUAGE here as elsewhere will not get over its awkwardness and thatit will continue to talk of opposites where there are only degreesand many refinements of gradation; it is equally to be hoped that theincarnated Tartuffery of morals which now belongs to our unconquerableflesh and blood will turn the words round in the mouths of usdiscerning ones. Here and there we understand it and laugh at the wayin which precisely the best knowledge seeks most to retain us in thisSIMPLIFIED thoroughly artificial suitably imagined and suitablyfalsified world: at the way in which whether it will or not it loveserror because as living itself it loves life!. After such a cheerful commencement a serious word would fain beheard; it appeals to the most serious minds. Take care ye philosophersand friends of knowledge and beware of martyrdom! Of suffering for thetruths sake! even in your own defense! It spoils all the innocenceand fine neutrality of your conscience; it makes you headstrong againstobjections and red rags; it stupefies animalizes and brutalizes whenin the struggle with danger slander suspicion expulsion and evenworse consequences of enmity ye have at last to play your last cardas protectors of truth upon earth--as though the Truth were such aninnocent and incompetent creature as to require protectors! and you ofall people ye knights of the sorrowful countenance Messrs Loafers andCobweb-spinners of the spirit! Finally ye know sufficiently well thatit cannot be of any consequence if YE just carry your point; ye knowthat hitherto no philosopher has carried his point and that there mightbe a more laudable truthfulness in every little interrogative markwhich you place after your special words and favourite doctrines andoccasionally after yourselves than in all the solemn pantomime andtrumping games before accusers and law-courts! Rather go out of the way!Flee into concealment! And have your masks and your ruses that ye maybe mistaken for what you are or somewhat feared! And pray dont forgetthe garden the garden with golden trellis-work! And have people aroundyou who are as a garden--or as music on the waters at eventide whenalready the day becomes a memory. Choose the GOOD solitude the freewanton lightsome solitude which also gives you the right still toremain good in any sense whatsoever! How poisonous how crafty how baddoes every long war make one which cannot be waged openly by meansof force! How PERSONAL does a long fear make one a long watchingof enemies of possible enemies! These pariahs of society theselong-pursued badly-persecuted ones--also the compulsory recluses theSpinozas or Giordano Brunos--always become in the end even under themost intellectual masquerade and perhaps without being themselves awareof it refined vengeance-seekers and poison-Brewers just lay barethe foundation of Spinozas ethics and theology! not to speak ofthe stupidity of moral indignation which is the unfailing sign in aphilosopher that the sense of philosophical humour has left him. Themartyrdom of the philosopher his sacrifice for the sake of truthforces into the light whatever of the agitator and actor lurks in him;and if one has hitherto contemplated him only with artistic curiositywith regard to many a philosopher it is easy to understand the dangerousdesire to see him also in his deterioration deteriorated into amartyr into a stage-and-tribune-bawler. Only that it is necessarywith such a desire to be clear WHAT spectacle one will see in anycase--merely a satyric play merely an epilogue farce merely thecontinued proof that the long real tragedy IS AT AN END supposing thatevery philosophy has been a long tragedy in its origin.. Every select man strives instinctively for a citadel and a privacywhere he is FREE from the crowd the many the majority--where he mayforget men who are the rule as their exception;--exclusive only ofthe case in which he is pushed straight to such men by a still strongerinstinct as a discerner in the great and exceptional sense. Whoever inintercourse with men does not occasionally glisten in all the greenand grey colours of distress owing to disgust satiety sympathygloominess and solitariness is assuredly not a man of elevated tastes;supposing however that he does not voluntarily take all this burdenand disgust upon himself that he persistently avoids it and remainsas I said quietly and proudly hidden in his citadel one thing is thencertain: he was not made he was not predestined for knowledge. For assuch he would one day have to say to himself: The devil take my goodtaste! but the rule is more interesting than the exception--thanmyself the exception! And he would go DOWN and above all he wouldgo inside. The long and serious study of the AVERAGE man--andconsequently much disguise self-overcoming familiarity and badintercourse all intercourse is bad intercourse except with onesequals:--that constitutes a necessary part of the life-history of everyphilosopher; perhaps the most disagreeable odious and disappointingpart. If he is fortunate however as a favourite child of knowledgeshould be he will meet with suitable auxiliaries who will shorten andlighten his task; I mean so-called cynics those who simply recognizethe animal the commonplace and the rule in themselves and at thesame time have so much spirituality and ticklishness as to make themtalk of themselves and their like BEFORE WITNESSES--sometimes theywallow even in books as on their own dung-hill. Cynicism is the onlyform in which base souls approach what is called honesty; and thehigher man must open his ears to all the coarser or finer cynicism andcongratulate himself when the clown becomes shameless right beforehim or the scientific satyr speaks out. There are even cases whereenchantment mixes with the disgust--namely where by a freak of naturegenius is bound to some such indiscreet billy-goat and ape as in thecase of the Abbe Galiani the profoundest acutest and perhaps alsofilthiest man of his century--he was far profounder than Voltaire andconsequently also a good deal more silent. It happens more frequentlyas has been hinted that a scientific head is placed on an apes body afine exceptional understanding in a base soul an occurrence by no meansrare especially among doctors and moral physiologists. And wheneveranyone speaks without bitterness or rather quite innocently of manas a belly with two requirements and a head with one; whenever any onesees seeks and WANTS to see only hunger sexual instinct and vanityas the real and only motives of human actions; in short when any onespeaks badly--and not even ill--of man then ought the lover ofknowledge to hearken attentively and diligently; he ought in generalto have an open ear wherever there is talk without indignation. For theindignant man and he who perpetually tears and lacerates himself withhis own teeth or in place of himself the world God or societymay indeed morally speaking stand higher than the laughing andself-satisfied satyr but in every other sense he is the more ordinarymore indifferent and less instructive case. And no one is such a LIARas the indignant man.. It is difficult to be understood especially when one thinks andlives gangasrotogati Footnote: Like the river Ganges: presto. amongthose only who think and live otherwise--namely kurmagati Footnote:Like the tortoise: lento. or at best froglike mandeikagatiFootnote: Like the frog: staccato. I do everything to be difficultlyunderstood myself!--and one should be heartily grateful for thegood will to some refinement of interpretation. As regards the goodfriends however who are always too easy-going and think that asfriends they have a right to ease one does well at the very first togrant them a play-ground and romping-place for misunderstanding--one canthus laugh still; or get rid of them altogether these good friends--andlaugh then also!. What is most difficult to render from one language into anotheris the TEMPO of its style which has its basis in the character of therace or to speak more physiologically in the average TEMPO of theassimilation of its nutriment. There are honestly meant translationswhich as involuntary vulgarizations are almost falsifications of theoriginal merely because its lively and merry TEMPO which overleaps andobviates all dangers in word and expression could not also berendered. A German is almost incapacitated for PRESTO in his language;consequently also as may be reasonably inferred for many of the mostdelightful and daring NUANCES of free free-spirited thought. And justas the buffoon and satyr are foreign to him in body and conscienceso Aristophanes and Petronius are untranslatable for him. Everythingponderous viscous and pompously clumsy all long-winded and wearyingspecies of style are developed in profuse variety among Germans--pardonme for stating the fact that even Goethes prose in its mixture ofstiffness and elegance is no exception as a reflection of the goodold time to which it belongs and as an expression of German taste at atime when there was still a German taste which was a rococo-tastein moribus et artibus. Lessing is an exception owing to his histrionicnature which understood much and was versed in many things; he who wasnot the translator of Bayle to no purpose who took refuge willingly inthe shadow of Diderot and Voltaire and still more willingly among theRoman comedy-writers--Lessing loved also free-spiritism in the TEMPOand flight out of Germany. But how could the German language evenin the prose of Lessing imitate the TEMPO of Machiavelli who in hisPrincipe makes us breathe the dry fine air of Florence and cannothelp presenting the most serious events in a boisterous allegrissimoperhaps not without a malicious artistic sense of the contrast heventures to present--long heavy difficult dangerous thoughts anda TEMPO of the gallop and of the best wantonest humour Finally whowould venture on a German translation of Petronius who more than anygreat musician hitherto was a master of PRESTO in invention ideas andwords What matter in the end about the swamps of the sick evil worldor of the ancient world when like him one has the feet of a windthe rush the breath the emancipating scorn of a wind which makeseverything healthy by making everything RUN! And with regard toAristophanes--that transfiguring complementary genius for whosesake one PARDONS all Hellenism for having existed provided one hasunderstood in its full profundity ALL that there requires pardon andtransfiguration; there is nothing that has caused me to meditate more onPLATOS secrecy and sphinx-like nature than the happily preserved petitfait that under the pillow of his death-bed there was found noBible nor anything Egyptian Pythagorean or Platonic--but a book ofAristophanes. How could even Plato have endured life--a Greek life whichhe repudiated--without an Aristophanes!. It is the business of the very few to be independent; it is aprivilege of the strong. And whoever attempts it even with the bestright but without being OBLIGED to do so proves that he is probablynot only strong but also daring beyond measure. He enters into alabyrinth he multiplies a thousandfold the dangers which life in itselfalready brings with it; not the least of which is that no one can seehow and where he loses his way becomes isolated and is torn piecemealby some minotaur of conscience. Supposing such a one comes to grief itis so far from the comprehension of men that they neither feel it norsympathize with it. And he cannot any longer go back! He cannot even goback again to the sympathy of men!. Our deepest insights must--and should--appear as follies and undercertain circumstances as crimes when they come unauthorizedly tothe ears of those who are not disposed and predestined for them. Theexoteric and the esoteric as they were formerly distinguished byphilosophers--among the Indians as among the Greeks Persians andMussulmans in short wherever people believed in gradations of rank andNOT in equality and equal rights--are not so much in contradistinctionto one another in respect to the exoteric class standing without andviewing estimating measuring and judging from the outside and notfrom the inside; the more essential distinction is that the class inquestion views things from below upwards--while the esoteric class viewsthings FROM ABOVE DOWNWARDS. There are heights of the soul from whichtragedy itself no longer appears to operate tragically; and if all thewoe in the world were taken together who would dare to decide whetherthe sight of it would NECESSARILY seduce and constrain to sympathy andthus to a doubling of the woe... That which serves the higher class ofmen for nourishment or refreshment must be almost poison to an entirelydifferent and lower order of human beings. The virtues of the commonman would perhaps mean vice and weakness in a philosopher; it might bepossible for a highly developed man supposing him to degenerate and goto ruin to acquire qualities thereby alone for the sake of which hewould have to be honoured as a saint in the lower world into which hehad sunk. There are books which have an inverse value for the soul andthe health according as the inferior soul and the lower vitality or thehigher and more powerful make use of them. In the former case they aredangerous disturbing unsettling books in the latter case they areherald-calls which summon the bravest to THEIR bravery. Books for thegeneral reader are always ill-smelling books the odour of paltry peopleclings to them. Where the populace eat and drink and even where theyreverence it is accustomed to stink. One should not go into churches ifone wishes to breathe PURE air.. In our youthful years we still venerate and despise without the artof NUANCE which is the best gain of life and we have rightly to dohard penance for having fallen upon men and things with Yea and Nay.Everything is so arranged that the worst of all tastes THE TASTE FORTHE UNCONDITIONAL is cruelly befooled and abused until a man learnsto introduce a little art into his sentiments and prefers to tryconclusions with the artificial as do the real artists of life. Theangry and reverent spirit peculiar to youth appears to allow itself nopeace until it has suitably falsified men and things to be ableto vent its passion upon them: youth in itself even is somethingfalsifying and deceptive. Later on when the young soul tortured bycontinual disillusions finally turns suspiciously against itself--stillardent and savage even in its suspicion and remorse of conscience: howit upbraids itself how impatiently it tears itself how it revengesitself for its long self-blinding as though it had been a voluntaryblindness! In this transition one punishes oneself by distrust of onessentiments; one tortures ones enthusiasm with doubt one feels even thegood conscience to be a danger as if it were the self-concealment andlassitude of a more refined uprightness; and above all one espousesupon principle the cause AGAINST youth.--A decade later and onecomprehends that all this was also still--youth!. Throughout the longest period of human history--one calls it theprehistoric period--the value or non-value of an action was inferredfrom its CONSEQUENCES; the action in itself was not taken intoconsideration any more than its origin; but pretty much as in China atpresent where the distinction or disgrace of a child redounds toits parents the retro-operating power of success or failure was whatinduced men to think well or ill of an action. Let us call this periodthe PRE-MORAL period of mankind; the imperative Know thyself! wasthen still unknown.--In the last ten thousand years on the other handon certain large portions of the earth one has gradually got so farthat one no longer lets the consequences of an action but its origindecide with regard to its worth: a great achievement as a whole animportant refinement of vision and of criterion the unconscious effectof the supremacy of aristocratic values and of the belief in originthe mark of a period which may be designated in the narrower sense asthe MORAL one: the first attempt at self-knowledge is therebymade. Instead of the consequences the origin--what an inversionof perspective! And assuredly an inversion effected only after longstruggle and wavering! To be sure an ominous new superstition apeculiar narrowness of interpretation attained supremacy preciselythereby: the origin of an action was interpreted in the most definitesense possible as origin out of an INTENTION; people were agreed in thebelief that the value of an action lay in the value of its intention.The intention as the sole origin and antecedent history of an action:under the influence of this prejudice moral praise and blame have beenbestowed and men have judged and even philosophized almost up to thepresent day.--Is it not possible however that the necessity may nowhave arisen of again making up our minds with regard to the reversingand fundamental shifting of values owing to a new self-consciousnessand acuteness in man--is it not possible that we may be standing onthe threshold of a period which to begin with would be distinguishednegatively as ULTRA-MORAL: nowadays when at least among us immoraliststhe suspicion arises that the decisive value of an action lies preciselyin that which is NOT INTENTIONAL and that all its intentionalness allthat is seen sensible or sensed in it belongs to its surface orskin--which like every skin betrays something but CONCEALS stillmore In short we believe that the intention is only a sign or symptomwhich first requires an explanation--a sign moreover which has toomany interpretations and consequently hardly any meaning in itselfalone: that morality in the sense in which it has been understoodhitherto as intention-morality has been a prejudice perhaps aprematureness or preliminariness probably something of the same rankas astrology and alchemy but in any case something which must besurmounted. The surmounting of morality in a certain sense even theself-mounting of morality--let that be the name for the long-secretlabour which has been reserved for the most refined the most uprightand also the most wicked consciences of today as the living touchstonesof the soul.. It cannot be helped: the sentiment of surrender of sacrifice forones neighbour and all self-renunciation-morality must be mercilesslycalled to account and brought to judgment; just as the aestheticsof disinterested contemplation under which the emasculation of artnowadays seeks insidiously enough to create itself a good conscience.There is far too much witchery and sugar in the sentiments for othersand NOT for myself for one not needing to be doubly distrustful hereand for one asking promptly: Are they not perhaps--DECEPTIONS--Thatthey PLEASE--him who has them and him who enjoys their fruit and alsothe mere spectator--that is still no argument in their FAVOUR but justcalls for caution. Let us therefore be cautious!. At whatever standpoint of philosophy one may place oneself nowadaysseen from every position the ERRONEOUSNESS of the world in which wethink we live is the surest and most certain thing our eyes can lightupon: we find proof after proof thereof which would fain allure us intosurmises concerning a deceptive principle in the nature of things.He however who makes thinking itself and consequently the spiritresponsible for the falseness of the world--an honourable exit whichevery conscious or unconscious advocatus dei avails himself of--hewho regards this world including space time form and movement asfalsely DEDUCED would have at least good reason in the end to becomedistrustful also of all thinking; has it not hitherto been playing uponus the worst of scurvy tricks and what guarantee would it give thatit would not continue to do what it has always been doing In allseriousness the innocence of thinkers has something touching andrespect-inspiring in it which even nowadays permits them to wait uponconsciousness with the request that it will give them HONEST answers:for example whether it be real or not and why it keeps the outerworld so resolutely at a distance and other questions of the samedescription. The belief in immediate certainties is a MORAL NAIVETEwhich does honour to us philosophers; but--we have now to cease beingMERELY moral men! Apart from morality such belief is a folly whichdoes little honour to us! If in middle-class life an ever-ready distrustis regarded as the sign of a bad character and consequently as animprudence here among us beyond the middle-class world and its Yeasand Nays what should prevent our being imprudent and saying: thephilosopher has at length a RIGHT to bad character as the being whohas hitherto been most befooled on earth--he is now under OBLIGATIONto distrustfulness to the wickedest squinting out of every abyss ofsuspicion.--Forgive me the joke of this gloomy grimace and turn ofexpression; for I myself have long ago learned to think and estimatedifferently with regard to deceiving and being deceived and I keep atleast a couple of pokes in the ribs ready for the blind rage with whichphilosophers struggle against being deceived. Why NOT It is nothingmore than a moral prejudice that truth is worth more than semblance; itis in fact the worst proved supposition in the world. So much must beconceded: there could have been no life at all except upon the basisof perspective estimates and semblances; and if with the virtuousenthusiasm and stupidity of many philosophers one wished to do awayaltogether with the seeming world--well granted that YOU could dothat--at least nothing of your truth would thereby remain! Indeedwhat is it that forces us in general to the supposition that there is anessential opposition of true and false Is it not enough to supposedegrees of seemingness and as it were lighter and darker shades andtones of semblance--different valeurs as the painters say Why mightnot the world WHICH CONCERNS US--be a fiction And to any one whosuggested: But to a fiction belongs an originator--might it not bebluntly replied: WHY May not this belong also belong to the fictionIs it not at length permitted to be a little ironical towards thesubject just as towards the predicate and object Might not thephilosopher elevate himself above faith in grammar All respectto governesses but is it not time that philosophy should renouncegoverness-faith. O Voltaire! O humanity! O idiocy! There is something ticklish inthe truth and in the SEARCH for the truth; and if man goes about ittoo humanely--il ne cherche le vrai que pour faire le bien--I wager hefinds nothing!. Supposing that nothing else is given as real but our world ofdesires and passions that we cannot sink or rise to any other realitybut just that of our impulses--for thinking is only a relation of theseimpulses to one another:--are we not permitted to make the attempt andto ask the question whether this which is given does not SUFFICE bymeans of our counterparts for the understanding even of the so-calledmechanical or material world I do not mean as an illusion asemblance a representation in the Berkeleyan and Schopenhaueriansense but as possessing the same degree of reality as our emotionsthemselves--as a more primitive form of the world of emotions inwhich everything still lies locked in a mighty unity which afterwardsbranches off and develops itself in organic processes naturally alsorefines and debilitates--as a kind of instinctive life in which allorganic functions including self-regulation assimilation nutritionsecretion and change of matter are still synthetically united withone another--as a PRIMARY FORM of life--In the end it is not onlypermitted to make this attempt it is commanded by the conscience ofLOGICAL METHOD. Not to assume several kinds of causality so long asthe attempt to get along with a single one has not been pushed to itsfurthest extent to absurdity if I may be allowed to say so: that isa morality of method which one may not repudiate nowadays--it followsfrom its definition as mathematicians say. The question is ultimatelywhether we really recognize the will as OPERATING whether we believe inthe causality of the will; if we do so--and fundamentally our belief INTHIS is just our belief in causality itself--we MUST make the attemptto posit hypothetically the causality of the will as the only causality.Will can naturally only operate on will--and not on matter noton nerves for instance: in short the hypothesis must behazarded whether will does not operate on will wherever effectsare recognized--and whether all mechanical action inasmuch as a poweroperates therein is not just the power of will the effect of will.Granted finally that we succeeded in explaining our entire instinctivelife as the development and ramification of one fundamental form ofwill--namely the Will to Power as my thesis puts it; granted that allorganic functions could be traced back to this Will to Power and thatthe solution of the problem of generation and nutrition--it is oneproblem--could also be found therein: one would thus have acquired theright to define ALL active force unequivocally as WILL TO POWER. Theworld seen from within the world defined and designated according toits intelligible character--it would simply be Will to Power andnothing else.. What Does not that mean in popular language: God is disproved butnot the devil--On the contrary! On the contrary my friends! And whothe devil also compels you to speak popularly!. As happened finally in all the enlightenment of modern times withthe French Revolution that terrible farce quite superfluous whenjudged close at hand into which however the noble and visionaryspectators of all Europe have interpreted from a distance their ownindignation and enthusiasm so long and passionately UNTIL THE TEXT HASDISAPPEARED UNDER THE INTERPRETATION so a noble posterity might oncemore misunderstand the whole of the past and perhaps only thereby makeITS aspect endurable.--Or rather has not this already happened Havenot we ourselves been--that noble posterity And in so far as we nowcomprehend this is it not--thereby already past. Nobody will very readily regard a doctrine as true merely becauseit makes people happy or virtuous--excepting perhaps the amiableIdealists who are enthusiastic about the good true and beautifuland let all kinds of motley coarse and good-natured desirabilitiesswim about promiscuously in their pond. Happiness and virtue are noarguments. It is willingly forgotten however even on the part ofthoughtful minds that to make unhappy and to make bad are just aslittle counter-arguments. A thing could be TRUE although it were inthe highest degree injurious and dangerous; indeed the fundamentalconstitution of existence might be such that one succumbed by a fullknowledge of it--so that the strength of a mind might be measured bythe amount of truth it could endure--or to speak more plainly by theextent to which it REQUIRED truth attenuated veiled sweetened dampedand falsified. But there is no doubt that for the discovery of certainPORTIONS of truth the wicked and unfortunate are more favourablysituated and have a greater likelihood of success; not to speak of thewicked who are happy--a species about whom moralists are silent. Perhapsseverity and craft are more favourable conditions for the development ofstrong independent spirits and philosophers than the gentle refinedyielding good-nature and habit of taking things easily which areprized and rightly prized in a learned man. Presupposing alwaysto begin with that the term philosopher be not confined to thephilosopher who writes books or even introduces HIS philosophy intobooks!--Stendhal furnishes a last feature of the portrait of thefree-spirited philosopher which for the sake of German taste I willnot omit to underline--for it is OPPOSED to German taste. Pour etrebon philosophe says this last great psychologist il faut etre secclair sans illusion. Un banquier qui a fait fortune a une partie ducaractere requis pour faire des decouvertes en philosophie cest-a-direpour voir clair dans ce qui est.. Everything that is profound loves the mask: the profoundest thingshave a hatred even of figure and likeness. Should not the CONTRARY onlybe the right disguise for the shame of a God to go about in A questionworth asking!--it would be strange if some mystic has not alreadyventured on the same kind of thing. There are proceedings of such adelicate nature that it is well to overwhelm them with coarsenessand make them unrecognizable; there are actions of love and of anextravagant magnanimity after which nothing can be wiser than to takea stick and thrash the witness soundly: one thereby obscures hisrecollection. Many a one is able to obscure and abuse his own memory inorder at least to have vengeance on this sole party in the secret:shame is inventive. They are not the worst things of which one ismost ashamed: there is not only deceit behind a mask--there is so muchgoodness in craft. I could imagine that a man with something costly andfragile to conceal would roll through life clumsily and rotundly likean old green heavily-hooped wine-cask: the refinement of his shamerequiring it to be so. A man who has depths in his shame meets hisdestiny and his delicate decisions upon paths which few ever reachand with regard to the existence of which his nearest and most intimatefriends may be ignorant; his mortal danger conceals itself from theireyes and equally so his regained security. Such a hidden naturewhich instinctively employs speech for silence and concealment and isinexhaustible in evasion of communication DESIRES and insists that amask of himself shall occupy his place in the hearts and heads of hisfriends; and supposing he does not desire it his eyes will some day beopened to the fact that there is nevertheless a mask of him there--andthat it is well to be so. Every profound spirit needs a mask; nay morearound every profound spirit there continually grows a mask owing tothe constantly false that is to say SUPERFICIAL interpretationof every word he utters every step he takes every sign of life hemanifests.. One must subject oneself to ones own tests that one is destinedfor independence and command and do so at the right time. One must notavoid ones tests although they constitute perhaps the most dangerousgame one can play and are in the end tests made only before ourselvesand before no other judge. Not to cleave to any person be it even thedearest--every person is a prison and also a recess. Not to cleave toa fatherland be it even the most suffering and necessitous--it is evenless difficult to detach ones heart from a victorious fatherland. Notto cleave to a sympathy be it even for higher men into whose peculiartorture and helplessness chance has given us an insight. Not to cleaveto a science though it tempt one with the most valuable discoveriesapparently specially reserved for us. Not to cleave to ones ownliberation to the voluptuous distance and remoteness of the bird whichalways flies further aloft in order always to see more under it--thedanger of the flier. Not to cleave to our own virtues nor become asa whole a victim to any of our specialties to our hospitality forinstance which is the danger of dangers for highly developedand wealthy souls who deal prodigally almost indifferently withthemselves and push the virtue of liberality so far that it becomesa vice. One must know how TO CONSERVE ONESELF--the best test ofindependence.. A new order of philosophers is appearing; I shall venture to baptizethem by a name not without danger. As far as I understand them as faras they allow themselves to be understood--for it is their nature toWISH to remain something of a puzzle--these philosophers of thefuture might rightly perhaps also wrongly claim to be designated astempters. This name itself is after all only an attempt or if it bepreferred a temptation.. Will they be new friends of truth these coming philosophers Veryprobably for all philosophers hitherto have loved their truths. Butassuredly they will not be dogmatists. It must be contrary to theirpride and also contrary to their taste that their truth should stillbe truth for every one--that which has hitherto been the secret wishand ultimate purpose of all dogmatic efforts. My opinion is MY opinion:another person has not easily a right to it--such a philosopher of thefuture will say perhaps. One must renounce the bad taste of wishing toagree with many people. Good is no longer good when ones neighbourtakes it into his mouth. And how could there be a common good! Theexpression contradicts itself; that which can be common is always ofsmall value. In the end things must be as they are and have alwaysbeen--the great things remain for the great the abysses for theprofound the delicacies and thrills for the refined and to sum upshortly everything rare for the rare.. Need I say expressly after all this that they will be free VERYfree spirits these philosophers of the future--as certainly also theywill not be merely free spirits but something more higher greaterand fundamentally different which does not wish to be misunderstood andmistaken But while I say this I feel under OBLIGATION almost as muchto them as to ourselves we free spirits who are their heralds andforerunners to sweep away from ourselves altogether a stupid oldprejudice and misunderstanding which like a fog has too long made theconception of free spirit obscure. In every country of Europe and thesame in America there is at present something which makes an abuse ofthis name a very narrow prepossessed enchained class of spiritswho desire almost the opposite of what our intentions and instinctsprompt--not to mention that in respect to the NEW philosophers who areappearing they must still more be closed windows and bolted doors.Briefly and regrettably they belong to the LEVELLERS these wronglynamed free spirits--as glib-tongued and scribe-fingered slaves ofthe democratic taste and its modern ideas all of them men withoutsolitude without personal solitude blunt honest fellows to whomneither courage nor honourable conduct ought to be denied only theyare not free and are ludicrously superficial especially in theirinnate partiality for seeing the cause of almost ALL human misery andfailure in the old forms in which society has hitherto existed--a notionwhich happily inverts the truth entirely! What they would fain attainwith all their strength is the universal green-meadow happiness of theherd together with security safety comfort and alleviation of lifefor every one their two most frequently chanted songs and doctrinesare called Equality of Rights and Sympathy with All Sufferers--andsuffering itself is looked upon by them as something which must beDONE AWAY WITH. We opposite ones however who have opened our eye andconscience to the question how and where the plant man has hithertogrown most vigorously believe that this has always taken place underthe opposite conditions that for this end the dangerousness of hissituation had to be increased enormously his inventive faculty anddissembling power his spirit had to develop into subtlety and daringunder long oppression and compulsion and his Will to Life had to beincreased to the unconditioned Will to Power--we believe that severityviolence slavery danger in the street and in the heart secrecystoicism tempters art and devilry of every kind--that everythingwicked terrible tyrannical predatory and serpentine in man servesas well for the elevation of the human species as its opposite--we donot even say enough when we only say THIS MUCH and in any case wefind ourselves here both with our speech and our silence at the OTHERextreme of all modern ideology and gregarious desirability as theirantipodes perhaps What wonder that we free spirits are not exactlythe most communicative spirits that we do not wish to betray in everyrespect WHAT a spirit can free itself from and WHERE perhaps it willthen be driven And as to the import of the dangerous formula BeyondGood and Evil with which we at least avoid confusion we ARE somethingelse than libres-penseurs liben pensatori free-thinkersand whatever these honest advocates of modern ideas like to callthemselves.

And perhaps ye arealso something of the same kind ye coming ones ye NEW philosophersCHAPTER III. THE RELIGIOUS MOOD. The human soul and its limits the range of mans inner experienceshitherto attained the heights depths and distances of theseexperiences the entire history of the soul UP TO THE PRESENT TIMEand its still unexhausted possibilities: this is the preordainedhunting-domain for a born psychologist and lover of a big hunt. Buthow often must he say despairingly to himself: A single individual!alas only a single individual! and this great forest this virginforest! So he would like to have some hundreds of hunting assistantsand fine trained hounds that he could send into the history of thehuman soul to drive HIS game together. In vain: again and again heexperiences profoundly and bitterly how difficult it is to findassistants and dogs for all the things that directly excite hiscuriosity. The evil of sending scholars into new and dangeroushunting-domains where courage sagacity and subtlety in every senseare required is that they are no longer serviceable just when the BIGhunt and also the great danger commences--it is precisely then thatthey lose their keen eye and nose. In order for instance to divine anddetermine what sort of history the problem of KNOWLEDGE AND CONSCIENCEhas hitherto had in the souls of homines religiosi a person wouldperhaps himself have to possess as profound as bruised as immense anexperience as the intellectual conscience of Pascal; and then he wouldstill require that wide-spread heaven of clear wicked spiritualitywhich from above would be able to oversee arrange and effectivelyformulize this mass of dangerous and painful experiences.--But whocould do me this service! And who would have time to wait for suchservants!--they evidently appear too rarely they are so improbable atall times! Eventually one must do everything ONESELF in order to knowsomething; which means that one has MUCH to do!--But a curiosity likemine is once for all the most agreeable of vices--pardon me! I mean tosay that the love of truth has its reward in heaven and already uponearth.. Faith such as early Christianity desired and not infrequentlyachieved in the midst of a skeptical and southernly free-spirited worldwhich had centuries of struggle between philosophical schools behindit and in it counting besides the education in tolerance whichthe Imperium Romanum gave--this faith is NOT that sincere austereslave-faith by which perhaps a Luther or a Cromwell or some othernorthern barbarian of the spirit remained attached to his God andChristianity it is much rather the faith of Pascal which resembles ina terrible manner a continuous suicide of reason--a tough long-livedworm-like reason which is not to be slain at once and with a singleblow. The Christian faith from the beginning is sacrifice the sacrificeof all freedom all pride all self-confidence of spirit it is atthe same time subjection self-derision and self-mutilation. There iscruelty and religious Phoenicianism in this faith which is adapted to atender many-sided and very fastidious conscience it takes for grantedthat the subjection of the spirit is indescribably PAINFUL that all thepast and all the habits of such a spirit resist the absurdissimum inthe form of which faith comes to it. Modern men with their obtusenessas regards all Christian nomenclature have no longer the sense for theterribly superlative conception which was implied to an antique taste bythe paradox of the formula God on the Cross. Hitherto there had neverand nowhere been such boldness in inversion nor anything at once sodreadful questioning and questionable as this formula: it promised atransvaluation of all ancient values--It was the Orient the PROFOUNDOrient it was the Oriental slave who thus took revenge on Rome and itsnoble light-minded toleration on the Roman Catholicism of non-faithand it was always not the faith but the freedom from the faith thehalf-stoical and smiling indifference to the seriousness of the faithwhich made the slaves indignant at their masters and revolt againstthem. Enlightenment causes revolt for the slave desires theunconditioned he understands nothing but the tyrannous even in moralshe loves as he hates without NUANCE to the very depths to the pointof pain to the point of sickness--his many HIDDEN sufferings makehim revolt against the noble taste which seems to DENY suffering. Theskepticism with regard to suffering fundamentally only an attitude ofaristocratic morality was not the least of the causes also of thelast great slave-insurrection which began with the French Revolution.. Wherever the religious neurosis has appeared on the earth so farwe find it connected with three dangerous prescriptions as to regimen:solitude fasting and sexual abstinence--but without its being possibleto determine with certainty which is cause and which is effect or IFany relation at all of cause and effect exists there. This latter doubtis justified by the fact that one of the most regular symptoms amongsavage as well as among civilized peoples is the most sudden andexcessive sensuality which then with equal suddenness transforms intopenitential paroxysms world-renunciation and will-renunciation bothsymptoms perhaps explainable as disguised epilepsy But nowhere is itMORE obligatory to put aside explanations around no other type has theregrown such a mass of absurdity and superstition no other type seems tohave been more interesting to men and even to philosophers--perhaps itis time to become just a little indifferent here to learn caution orbetter still to look AWAY TO GO AWAY--Yet in the background of themost recent philosophy that of Schopenhauer we find almost as theproblem in itself this terrible note of interrogation of the religiouscrisis and awakening. How is the negation of will POSSIBLE how is thesaint possible--that seems to have been the very question with whichSchopenhauer made a start and became a philosopher. And thus it was agenuine Schopenhauerian consequence that his most convinced adherentperhaps also his last as far as Germany is concerned namely RichardWagner should bring his own life-work to an end just here and shouldfinally put that terrible and eternal type upon the stage as Kundrytype vecu and as it loved and lived at the very time that themad-doctors in almost all European countries had an opportunity to studythe type close at hand wherever the religious neurosis--or as I callit the religious mood--made its latest epidemical outbreak anddisplay as the Salvation Army--If it be a question however as towhat has been so extremely interesting to men of all sorts in all agesand even to philosophers in the whole phenomenon of the saint itis undoubtedly the appearance of the miraculous therein--namely theimmediate SUCCESSION OF OPPOSITES of states of the soul regarded asmorally antithetical: it was believed here to be self-evident thata bad man was all at once turned into a saint a good man. Thehitherto existing psychology was wrecked at this point is it notpossible it may have happened principally because psychology had placeditself under the dominion of morals because it BELIEVED in oppositionsof moral values and saw read and INTERPRETED these oppositionsinto the text and facts of the case What Miracle only an error ofinterpretation A lack of philology. It seems that the Latin races are far more deeply attached to theirCatholicism than we Northerners are to Christianity generally andthat consequently unbelief in Catholic countries means something quitedifferent from what it does among Protestants--namely a sort of revoltagainst the spirit of the race while with us it is rather a return tothe spirit or non-spirit of the race.We Northerners undoubtedly derive our origin from barbarous races evenas regards our talents for religion--we have POOR talents for it. Onemay make an exception in the case of the Celts who have theretoforefurnished also the best soil for Christian infection in the North: theChristian ideal blossomed forth in France as much as ever the pale sunof the north would allow it. How strangely pious for our taste are stillthese later French skeptics whenever there is any Celtic blood in theirorigin! How Catholic how un-German does Auguste Comtes Sociologyseem to us with the Roman logic of its instincts! How Jesuitical thatamiable and shrewd cicerone of Port Royal Sainte-Beuve in spite of allhis hostility to Jesuits! And even Ernest Renan: how inaccessible tous Northerners does the language of such a Renan appear in whomevery instant the merest touch of religious thrill throws his refinedvoluptuous and comfortably couching soul off its balance! Let us repeatafter him these fine sentences--and what wickedness and haughtiness isimmediately aroused by way of answer in our probably less beautiful butharder souls that is to say in our more German souls!--DISONS DONCHARDIMENT QUE LA RELIGION EST UN PRODUIT DE LHOMME NORMAL QUE LHOMMEEST LE PLUS DANS LE VRAI QUANT IL EST LE PLUS RELIGIEUX ET LE PLUSASSURE DUNE DESTINEE INFINIE.... CEST QUAND IL EST BON QUIL VEUT QUELA VIRTU CORRESPONDE A UN ORDER ETERNAL CEST QUAND IL CONTEMPLE LESCHOSES DUNE MANIERE DESINTERESSEE QUIL TROUVE LA MORT REVOLTANTE ETABSURDE. COMMENT NE PAS SUPPOSER QUE CEST DANS CES MOMENTS-LA QUELHOMME VOIT LE MIEUX... These sentences are so extremely ANTIPODALto my ears and habits of thought that in my first impulse of rageon finding them I wrote on the margin LA NIAISERIE RELIGIEUSE PAREXCELLENCE!--until in my later rage I even took a fancy to them thesesentences with their truth absolutely inverted! It is so nice and such adistinction to have ones own antipodes!. That which is so astonishing in the religious life of the ancientGreeks is the irrestrainable stream of GRATITUDE which it poursforth--it is a very superior kind of man who takes SUCH an attitudetowards nature and life.--Later on when the populace got the upper handin Greece FEAR became rampant also in religion; and Christianity waspreparing itself.. The passion for God: there are churlish honest-hearted andimportunate kinds of it like that of Luther--the whole of Protestantismlacks the southern DELICATEZZA. There is an Oriental exaltation of themind in it like that of an undeservedly favoured or elevated slave asin the case of St. Augustine for instance who lacks in an offensivemanner all nobility in bearing and desires. There is a femininetenderness and sensuality in it which modestly and unconsciously longsfor a UNIO MYSTICA ET PHYSICA as in the case of Madame de Guyon. Inmany cases it appears curiously enough as the disguise of a girlsor youths puberty; here and there even as the hysteria of an old maidalso as her last ambition. The Church has frequently canonized the womanin such a case.. The mightiest men have hitherto always bowed reverently beforethe saint as the enigma of self-subjugation and utter voluntaryprivation--why did they thus bow They divined in him--and as it werebehind the questionableness of his frail and wretched appearance--thesuperior force which wished to test itself by such a subjugation; thestrength of will in which they recognized their own strength andlove of power and knew how to honour it: they honoured somethingin themselves when they honoured the saint. In addition to this thecontemplation of the saint suggested to them a suspicion: such anenormity of self-negation and anti-naturalness will not have beencoveted for nothing--they have said inquiringly. There is perhaps areason for it some very great danger about which the ascetic mightwish to be more accurately informed through his secret interlocutors andvisitors In a word the mighty ones of the world learned to have a newfear before him they divined a new power a strange still unconqueredenemy:--it was the Will to Power which obliged them to halt before thesaint. They had to question him.. In the Jewish Old Testament the book of divine justice there aremen things and sayings on such an immense scale that Greek and Indianliterature has nothing to compare with it. One stands with fear andreverence before those stupendous remains of what man was formerly andone has sad thoughts about old Asia and its little out-pushed peninsulaEurope which would like by all means to figure before Asia as theProgress of Mankind. To be sure he who is himself only a slendertame house-animal and knows only the wants of a house-animal likeour cultured people of today including the Christians of culturedChristianity need neither be amazed nor even sad amid those ruins--thetaste for the Old Testament is a touchstone with respect to great andsmall: perhaps he will find that the New Testament the book of gracestill appeals more to his heart there is much of the odour of thegenuine tender stupid beadsman and petty soul in it. To have boundup this New Testament a kind of ROCOCO of taste in every respect alongwith the Old Testament into one book as the Bible as The Book inItself is perhaps the greatest audacity and sin against the Spiritwhich literary Europe has upon its conscience.. Why Atheism nowadays The father in God is thoroughly refuted;equally so the judge the rewarder. Also his free will: he doesnot hear--and even if he did he would not know how to help. The worstis that he seems incapable of communicating himself clearly; is heuncertain--This is what I have made out by questioning and listeningat a variety of conversations to be the cause of the decline ofEuropean theism; it appears to me that though the religious instinct isin vigorous growth--it rejects the theistic satisfaction with profounddistrust.. What does all modern philosophy mainly do Since Descartes--andindeed more in defiance of him than on the basis of his procedure--anATTENTAT has been made on the part of all philosophers on the oldconception of the soul under the guise of a criticism of the subjectand predicate conception--that is to say an ATTENTAT on thefundamental presupposition of Christian doctrine. Modern philosophyas epistemological skepticism is secretly or openly ANTI-CHRISTIANalthough for keener ears be it said by no means anti-religious.Formerly in effect one believed in the soul as one believed ingrammar and the grammatical subject: one said I is the conditionthink is the predicate and is conditioned--to think is an activity forwhich one MUST suppose a subject as cause. The attempt was then madewith marvelous tenacity and subtlety to see if one could not get outof this net--to see if the opposite was not perhaps true: think thecondition and I the conditioned; I therefore only a synthesiswhich has been MADE by thinking itself. KANT really wished to provethat starting from the subject the subject could not be proved--northe object either: the possibility of an APPARENT EXISTENCE of thesubject and therefore of the soul may not always have been strangeto him--the thought which once had an immense power on earth as theVedanta philosophy.. There is a great ladder of religious cruelty with many rounds; butthree of these are the most important. Once on a time men sacrificedhuman beings to their God and perhaps just those they loved thebest--to this category belong the firstling sacrifices of all primitivereligions and also the sacrifice of the Emperor Tiberius in theMithra-Grotto on the Island of Capri that most terrible of all Romananachronisms. Then during the moral epoch of mankind they sacrificedto their God the strongest instincts they possessed their nature;THIS festal joy shines in the cruel glances of ascetics andanti-natural fanatics. Finally what still remained to be sacrificedWas it not necessary in the end for men to sacrifice everythingcomforting holy healing all hope all faith in hidden harmonies infuture blessedness and justice Was it not necessary to sacrifice Godhimself and out of cruelty to themselves to worship stone stupiditygravity fate nothingness To sacrifice God for nothingness--thisparadoxical mystery of the ultimate cruelty has been reserved for therising generation; we all know something thereof already.. Whoever like myself prompted by some enigmatical desire has longendeavoured to go to the bottom of the question of pessimism and free itfrom the half-Christian half-German narrowness and stupidity in whichit has finally presented itself to this century namely in the form ofSchopenhauers philosophy; whoever with an Asiatic and super-Asiaticeye has actually looked inside and into the most world-renouncing ofall possible modes of thought--beyond good and evil and no longerlike Buddha and Schopenhauer under the dominion and delusion ofmorality--whoever has done this has perhaps just thereby withoutreally desiring it opened his eyes to behold the opposite ideal: theideal of the most world-approving exuberant and vivacious man who hasnot only learnt to compromise and arrange with that which was andis but wishes to have it again AS IT WAS AND IS for all eternityinsatiably calling out da capo not only to himself but to the wholepiece and play; and not only the play but actually to him who requiresthe play--and makes it necessary; because he always requireshimself anew--and makes himself necessary.--What And this would notbe--circulus vitiosus deus. The distance and as it were the space around man grows with thestrength of his intellectual vision and insight: his world becomesprofounder; new stars new enigmas and notions are ever coming intoview. Perhaps everything on which the intellectual eye has exercisedits acuteness and profundity has just been an occasion for its exercisesomething of a game something for children and childish minds. Perhapsthe most solemn conceptions that have caused the most fighting andsuffering the conceptions God and sin will one day seem to us ofno more importance than a childs plaything or a childs pain seems toan old man;--and perhaps another plaything and another pain will thenbe necessary once more for the old man--always childish enough aneternal child!. Has it been observed to what extent outward idleness orsemi-idleness is necessary to a real religious life alike for itsfavourite microscopic labour of self-examination and for its softplacidity called prayer the state of perpetual readiness for thecoming of God I mean the idleness with a good conscience theidleness of olden times and of blood to which the aristocraticsentiment that work is DISHONOURING--that it vulgarizes body andsoul--is not quite unfamiliar And that consequently the modern noisytime-engrossing conceited foolishly proud laboriousness educatesand prepares for unbelief more than anything else Among these forinstance who are at present living apart from religion in Germany Ifind free-thinkers of diversified species and origin but above alla majority of those in whom laboriousness from generation to generationhas dissolved the religious instincts; so that they no longer know whatpurpose religions serve and only note their existence in the worldwith a kind of dull astonishment. They feel themselves already fullyoccupied these good people be it by their business or by theirpleasures not to mention the Fatherland and the newspapers andtheir family duties; it seems that they have no time whatever leftfor religion; and above all it is not obvious to them whether it is aquestion of a new business or a new pleasure--for it is impossible theysay to themselves that people should go to church merely to spoiltheir tempers. They are by no means enemies of religious customs;should certain circumstances State affairs perhaps require theirparticipation in such customs they do what is required as so manythings are done--with a patient and unassuming seriousness and withoutmuch curiosity or discomfort;--they live too much apart and outsideto feel even the necessity for a FOR or AGAINST in such matters. Amongthose indifferent persons may be reckoned nowadays the majority ofGerman Protestants of the middle classes especially in the greatlaborious centres of trade and commerce; also the majority of laboriousscholars and the entire University personnel with the exception ofthe theologians whose existence and possibility there always givespsychologists new and more subtle puzzles to solve. On the part ofpious or merely church-going people there is seldom any idea of HOWMUCH good-will one might say arbitrary will is now necessary for aGerman scholar to take the problem of religion seriously; his wholeprofession and as I have said his whole workmanlike laboriousness towhich he is compelled by his modern conscience inclines him to alofty and almost charitable serenity as regards religion with which isoccasionally mingled a slight disdain for the uncleanliness of spiritwhich he takes for granted wherever any one still professes to belongto the Church. It is only with the help of history NOT through his ownpersonal experience therefore that the scholar succeeds in bringinghimself to a respectful seriousness and to a certain timid deferencein presence of religions; but even when his sentiments have reached thestage of gratitude towards them he has not personally advanced onestep nearer to that which still maintains itself as Church or as piety;perhaps even the contrary. The practical indifference to religiousmatters in the midst of which he has been born and brought up usuallysublimates itself in his case into circumspection and cleanliness whichshuns contact with religious men and things; and it may be just thedepth of his tolerance and humanity which prompts him to avoid thedelicate trouble which tolerance itself brings with it.--Every age hasits own divine type of naivete for the discovery of which other agesmay envy it: and how much naivete--adorable childlike and boundlesslyfoolish naivete is involved in this belief of the scholar inhis superiority in the good conscience of his tolerance in theunsuspecting simple certainty with which his instinct treats thereligious man as a lower and less valuable type beyond before andABOVE which he himself has developed--he the little arrogant dwarfand mob-man the sedulously alert head-and-hand drudge of ideas ofmodern ideas!. Whoever has seen deeply into the world has doubtless divined whatwisdom there is in the fact that men are superficial. It is theirpreservative instinct which teaches them to be flighty lightsome andfalse. Here and there one finds a passionate and exaggerated adorationof pure forms in philosophers as well as in artists: it is not to bedoubted that whoever has NEED of the cult of the superficial to thatextent has at one time or another made an unlucky dive BENEATH it.Perhaps there is even an order of rank with respect to those burntchildren the born artists who find the enjoyment of life only in tryingto FALSIFY its image as if taking wearisome revenge on it one mightguess to what degree life has disgusted them by the extent to whichthey wish to see its image falsified attenuated ultrified anddeified--one might reckon the homines religiosi among the artists astheir HIGHEST rank. It is the profound suspicious fear of an incurablepessimism which compels whole centuries to fasten their teeth into areligious interpretation of existence: the fear of the instinct whichdivines that truth might be attained TOO soon before man has becomestrong enough hard enough artist enough.... Piety the Life in Godregarded in this light would appear as the most elaborate andultimate product of the FEAR of truth as artist-adorationand artist-intoxication in presence of the most logical of allfalsifications as the will to the inversion of truth to untruth atany price. Perhaps there has hitherto been no more effective means ofbeautifying man than piety by means of it man can become so artful sosuperficial so iridescent and so good that his appearance no longeroffends.. To love mankind FOR GODS SAKE--this has so far been the noblest andremotest sentiment to which mankind has attained. That love to mankindwithout any redeeming intention in the background is only an ADDITIONALfolly and brutishness that the inclination to this love has first toget its proportion its delicacy its gram of salt and sprinklingof ambergris from a higher inclination--whoever first perceivedand experienced this however his tongue may have stammered as itattempted to express such a delicate matter let him for all time beholy and respected as the man who has so far flown highest and goneastray in the finest fashion!. The philosopher as WE free spirits understand him--as the man ofthe greatest responsibility who has the conscience for the generaldevelopment of mankind--will use religion for his disciplining andeducating work just as he will use the contemporary politicaland economic conditions. The selecting and disciplininginfluence--destructive as well as creative and fashioning--which can beexercised by means of religion is manifold and varied according to thesort of people placed under its spell and protection. For those who arestrong and independent destined and trained to command in whom thejudgment and skill of a ruling race is incorporated religion isan additional means for overcoming resistance in the exercise ofauthority--as a bond which binds rulers and subjects in commonbetraying and surrendering to the former the conscience of the lattertheir inmost heart which would fain escape obedience. And in thecase of the unique natures of noble origin if by virtue of superiorspirituality they should incline to a more retired and contemplativelife reserving to themselves only the more refined forms of governmentover chosen disciples or members of an order religion itself maybe used as a means for obtaining peace from the noise and trouble ofmanaging GROSSER affairs and for securing immunity from the UNAVOIDABLEfilth of all political agitation. The Brahmins for instance understoodthis fact. With the help of a religious organization they secured tothemselves the power of nominating kings for the people while theirsentiments prompted them to keep apart and outside as men with a higherand super-regal mission. At the same time religion gives inducement andopportunity to some of the subjects to qualify themselves for futureruling and commanding the slowly ascending ranks and classes in whichthrough fortunate marriage customs volitional power and delight inself-control are on the increase. To them religion offers sufficientincentives and temptations to aspire to higher intellectuality and toexperience the sentiments of authoritative self-control of silence andof solitude. Asceticism and Puritanism are almost indispensable means ofeducating and ennobling a race which seeks to rise above its hereditarybaseness and work itself upwards to future supremacy. And finally toordinary men to the majority of the people who exist for service andgeneral utility and are only so far entitled to exist religion givesinvaluable contentedness with their lot and condition peace of heartennoblement of obedience additional social happiness and sympathywith something of transfiguration and embellishment something ofjustification of all the commonplaceness all the meanness allthe semi-animal poverty of their souls. Religion together with thereligious significance of life sheds sunshine over such perpetuallyharassed men and makes even their own aspect endurable to them itoperates upon them as the Epicurean philosophy usually operates uponsufferers of a higher order in a refreshing and refining manneralmost TURNING suffering TO ACCOUNT and in the end even hallowing andvindicating it. There is perhaps nothing so admirable in Christianityand Buddhism as their art of teaching even the lowest to elevatethemselves by piety to a seemingly higher order of things and therebyto retain their satisfaction with the actual world in which they find itdifficult enough to live--this very difficulty being necessary.. To be sure--to make also the bad counter-reckoning against suchreligions and to bring to light their secret dangers--the cost isalways excessive and terrible when religions do NOT operate as aneducational and disciplinary medium in the hands of the philosopher butrule voluntarily and PARAMOUNTLY when they wish to be the final endand not a means along with other means. Among men as among all otheranimals there is a surplus of defective diseased degeneratinginfirm and necessarily suffering individuals; the successful casesamong men also are always the exception; and in view of the fact thatman is THE ANIMAL NOT YET PROPERLY ADAPTED TO HIS ENVIRONMENT the rareexception. But worse still. The higher the type a man represents thegreater is the improbability that he will SUCCEED; the accidental thelaw of irrationality in the general constitution of mankind manifestsitself most terribly in its destructive effect on the higher orders ofmen the conditions of whose lives are delicate diverse and difficultto determine. What then is the attitude of the two greatest religionsabove-mentioned to the SURPLUS of failures in life They endeavourto preserve and keep alive whatever can be preserved; in fact as thereligions FOR SUFFERERS they take the part of these upon principle;they are always in favour of those who suffer from life as from adisease and they would fain treat every other experience of life asfalse and impossible. However highly we may esteem this indulgent andpreservative care inasmuch as in applying to others it has appliedand applies also to the highest and usually the most suffering type ofman the hitherto PARAMOUNT religions--to give a general appreciationof them--are among the principal causes which have kept the type ofman upon a lower level--they have preserved too much THAT WHICH SHOULDHAVE PERISHED. One has to thank them for invaluable services; and who issufficiently rich in gratitude not to feel poor at the contemplationof all that the spiritual men of Christianity have done for Europehitherto! But when they had given comfort to the sufferers courage tothe oppressed and despairing a staff and support to the helplessand when they had allured from society into convents and spiritualpenitentiaries the broken-hearted and distracted: what else had theyto do in order to work systematically in that fashion and with a goodconscience for the preservation of all the sick and suffering whichmeans in deed and in truth to work for the DETERIORATION OF THEEUROPEAN RACE To REVERSE all estimates of value--THAT is what theyhad to do! And to shatter the strong to spoil great hopes to castsuspicion on the delight in beauty to break down everything autonomousmanly conquering and imperious--all instincts which are natural to thehighest and most successful type of man--into uncertainty distressof conscience and self-destruction; forsooth to invert all love of theearthly and of supremacy over the earth into hatred of the earth andearthly things--THAT is the task the Church imposed on itself andwas obliged to impose until according to its standard of valueunworldliness unsensuousness and higher man fused into onesentiment. If one could observe the strangely painful equally coarseand refined comedy of European Christianity with the derisive andimpartial eye of an Epicurean god I should think one would never ceasemarvelling and laughing; does it not actually seem that some single willhas ruled over Europe for eighteen centuries in order to make a SUBLIMEABORTION of man He however who with opposite requirements no longerEpicurean and with some divine hammer in his hand could approach thisalmost voluntary degeneration and stunting of mankind as exemplified inthe European Christian Pascal for instance would he not have tocry aloud with rage pity and horror: Oh you bunglers presumptuouspitiful bunglers what have you done! Was that a work for your handsHow you have hacked and botched my finest stone! What have you presumedto do!--I should say that Christianity has hitherto been the mostportentous of presumptions. Men not great enough nor hard enoughto be entitled as artists to take part in fashioning MAN; mennot sufficiently strong and far-sighted to ALLOW with sublimeself-constraint the obvious law of the thousandfold failures andperishings to prevail; men not sufficiently noble to see the radicallydifferent grades of rank and intervals of rank that separate man fromman:--SUCH men with their equality before God have hitherto swayedthe destiny of Europe; until at last a dwarfed almost ludicrous specieshas been produced a gregarious animal something obliging sicklymediocre the European of the present day.CHAPTER IV.

We all feign to ourselves that we are simpler than we are we thusrelax ourselves away from our fellows.. A discerning one might easily regard himself at present as theanimalization of God.. Discovering reciprocal love should really disenchant the lover withregard to the beloved. What! She is modest enough to love even you Orstupid enough Or--or---. THE DANGER IN HAPPINESS.--Everything now turns out best for me Inow love every fate:--who would like to be my fate. Not their love of humanity but the impotence of their loveprevents the Christians of today--burning us..

The moral sentiment in Europe at present is perhaps as subtlebelated diverse sensitive and refined as the Science of Moralsbelonging thereto is recent initial awkward and coarse-fingered:--aninteresting contrast which sometimes becomes incarnate and obviousin the very person of a moralist. Indeed the expression Scienceof Morals is in respect to what is designated thereby far toopresumptuous and counter to GOOD taste--which is always a foretaste ofmore modest expressions. One ought to avow with the utmost fairness WHATis still necessary here for a long time WHAT is alone proper for thepresent: namely the collection of material the comprehensive surveyand classification of an immense domain of delicate sentiments of worthand distinctions of worth which live grow propagate and perish--andperhaps attempts to give a clear idea of the recurring and more commonforms of these living crystallizations--as preparation for a THEORY OFTYPES of morality. To be sure people have not hitherto been so modest.All the philosophers with a pedantic and ridiculous seriousnessdemanded of themselves something very much higher more pretentious andceremonious when they concerned themselves with morality as a science:they wanted to GIVE A BASIC to morality--and every philosopher hithertohas believed that he has given it a basis; morality itself however hasbeen regarded as something given. How far from their awkward pridewas the seemingly insignificant problem--left in dust and decay--of adescription of forms of morality notwithstanding that the finest handsand senses could hardly be fine enough for it! It was precisely owing tomoral philosophers knowing the moral facts imperfectly in an arbitraryepitome or an accidental abridgement--perhaps as the morality oftheir environment their position their church their Zeitgeist theirclimate and zone--it was precisely because they were badly instructedwith regard to nations eras and past ages and were by no means eagerto know about these matters that they did not even come in sight of thereal problems of morals--problems which only disclose themselves bya comparison of MANY kinds of morality. In every Science of Moralshitherto strange as it may sound the problem of morality itselfhas been OMITTED: there has been no suspicion that there was anythingproblematic there! That which philosophers called giving a basis tomorality and endeavoured to realize has when seen in a right lightproved merely a learned form of good FAITH in prevailing morality a newmeans of its EXPRESSION consequently just a matter-of-fact within thesphere of a definite morality yea in its ultimate motive a sort ofdenial that it is LAWFUL for this morality to be called in question--andin any case the reverse of the testing analyzing doubting andvivisecting of this very faith. Hear for instance with whatinnocence--almost worthy of honour--Schopenhauer represents his owntask and draw your conclusions concerning the scientificness of aScience whose latest master still talks in the strain of children andold wives: The principle he says page  of the Grundprobleme derEthik Footnote: Pages - of Schopenhauers Basis of Moralitytranslated by Arthur B. Bullock M.A. . the axiom about thepurport of which all moralists are PRACTICALLY agreed: neminem laedeimmo omnes quantum potes juva--is REALLY the proposition which all moralteachers strive to establish ... the REAL basis of ethics whichhas been sought like the philosophers stone for centuries.--Thedifficulty of establishing the proposition referred to may indeed begreat--it is well known that Schopenhauer also was unsuccessful in hisefforts; and whoever has thoroughly realized how absurdly false andsentimental this proposition is in a world whose essence is Willto Power may be reminded that Schopenhauer although a pessimistACTUALLY--played the flute... daily after dinner: one may read aboutthe matter in his biography. A question by the way: a pessimist arepudiator of God and of the world who MAKES A HALT at morality--whoassents to morality and plays the flute to laede-neminem morals whatIs that really--a pessimist. Apart from the value of such assertions as there is a categoricalimperative in us one can always ask: What does such an assertionindicate about him who makes it There are systems of morals which aremeant to justify their author in the eyes of other people; other systemsof morals are meant to tranquilize him and make him self-satisfied;with other systems he wants to crucify and humble himself with othershe wishes to take revenge with others to conceal himself with othersto glorify himself and gave superiority and distinction--this system ofmorals helps its author to forget that system makes him or somethingof him forgotten many a moralist would like to exercise power andcreative arbitrariness over mankind many another perhaps Kantespecially gives us to understand by his morals that what is estimablein me is that I know how to obey--and with you it SHALL not beotherwise than with me! In short systems of morals are only aSIGN-LANGUAGE OF THE EMOTIONS.. In contrast to laisser-aller every system of morals is a sort oftyranny against nature and also against reason that is however noobjection unless one should again decree by some system of morals thatall kinds of tyranny and unreasonableness are unlawful What isessential and invaluable in every system of morals is that it is along constraint. In order to understand Stoicism or Port Royalor Puritanism one should remember the constraint under which everylanguage has attained to strength and freedom--the metrical constraintthe tyranny of rhyme and rhythm. How much trouble have the poets andorators of every nation given themselves!--not excepting some ofthe prose writers of today in whose ear dwells an inexorableconscientiousness--for the sake of a folly as utilitarian bunglerssay and thereby deem themselves wise--from submission to arbitrarylaws as the anarchists say and thereby fancy themselves free evenfree-spirited. The singular fact remains however that everythingof the nature of freedom elegance boldness dance and masterlycertainty which exists or has existed whether it be in thought itselfor in administration or in speaking and persuading in art just as inconduct has only developed by means of the tyranny of such arbitrarylaw and in all seriousness it is not at all improbable that preciselythis is nature and natural--and not laisser-aller! Every artistknows how different from the state of letting himself go is hismost natural condition the free arranging locating disposingand constructing in the moments of inspiration--and how strictly anddelicately he then obeys a thousand laws which by their very rigidnessand precision defy all formulation by means of ideas even the moststable idea has in comparison therewith something floating manifoldand ambiguous in it. The essential thing in heaven and in earth isapparently to repeat it once more that there should be long OBEDIENCEin the same direction there thereby results and has always resulted inthe long run something which has made life worth living; for instancevirtue art music dancing reason spirituality--anything whateverthat is transfiguring refined foolish or divine. The long bondage ofthe spirit the distrustful constraint in the communicability ofideas the discipline which the thinker imposed on himself to thinkin accordance with the rules of a church or a court or conformableto Aristotelian premises the persistent spiritual will to interpreteverything that happened according to a Christian scheme and in everyoccurrence to rediscover and justify the Christian God:--all thisviolence arbitrariness severity dreadfulness and unreasonablenesshas proved itself the disciplinary means whereby the European spirit hasattained its strength its remorseless curiosity and subtle mobility;granted also that much irrecoverable strength and spirit had to bestifled suffocated and spoilt in the process for here as everywherenature shows herself as she is in all her extravagant and INDIFFERENTmagnificence which is shocking but nevertheless noble. Thatfor centuries European thinkers only thought in order to provesomething--nowadays on the contrary we are suspicious of every thinkerwho wishes to prove something--that it was always settled beforehandwhat WAS TO BE the result of their strictest thinking as it was perhapsin the Asiatic astrology of former times or as it is still at thepresent day in the innocent Christian-moral explanation of immediatepersonal events for the glory of God or for the good of thesoul:--this tyranny this arbitrariness this severe and magnificentstupidity has EDUCATED the spirit; slavery both in the coarser andthe finer sense is apparently an indispensable means even of spiritualeducation and discipline. One may look at every system of morals in thislight: it is nature therein which teaches to hate the laisser-allerthe too great freedom and implants the need for limited horizons forimmediate duties--it teaches the NARROWING OF PERSPECTIVES and thus ina certain sense that stupidity is a condition of life and development.Thou must obey some one and for a long time; OTHERWISE thou wilt cometo grief and lose all respect for thyself--this seems to me to be themoral imperative of nature which is certainly neither categoricalas old Kant wished consequently the otherwise nor does it addressitself to the individual what does nature care for the individual!but to nations races ages and ranks; above all however to theanimal man generally to MANKIND.. Industrious races find it a great hardship to be idle: it was amaster stroke of ENGLISH instinct to hallow and begloom Sunday to suchan extent that the Englishman unconsciously hankers for his week--andwork-day again:--as a kind of cleverly devised cleverly intercalatedFAST such as is also frequently found in the ancient world althoughas is appropriate in southern nations not precisely with respectto work. Many kinds of fasts are necessary; and wherever powerfulinfluences and habits prevail legislators have to see that intercalarydays are appointed on which such impulses are fettered and learn tohunger anew. Viewed from a higher standpoint whole generations andepochs when they show themselves infected with any moral fanaticismseem like those intercalated periods of restraint and fasting duringwhich an impulse learns to humble and submit itself--at the same timealso to PURIFY and SHARPEN itself; certain philosophical sects likewiseadmit of a similar interpretation for instance the Stoa in the midstof Hellenic culture with the atmosphere rank and overcharged withAphrodisiacal odours.--Here also is a hint for the explanation of theparadox why it was precisely in the most Christian period of Europeanhistory and in general only under the pressure of Christian sentimentsthat the sexual impulse sublimated into love amour-passion.. There is something in the morality of Plato which does not reallybelong to Plato but which only appears in his philosophy one mightsay in spite of him: namely Socratism for which he himself wastoo noble. No one desires to injure himself hence all evil is doneunwittingly. The evil man inflicts injury on himself; he would not doso however if he knew that evil is evil. The evil man therefore isonly evil through error; if one free him from error one will necessarilymake him--good.--This mode of reasoning savours of the POPULACE whoperceive only the unpleasant consequences of evil-doing and practicallyjudge that it is STUPID to do wrong; while they accept good asidentical with useful and pleasant without further thought. Asregards every system of utilitarianism one may at once assume that ithas the same origin and follow the scent: one will seldom err.--Platodid all he could to interpret something refined and noble into thetenets of his teacher and above all to interpret himself into them--hethe most daring of all interpreters who lifted the entire Socrates outof the street as a popular theme and song to exhibit him in endlessand impossible modifications--namely in all his own disguises andmultiplicities. In jest and in Homeric language as well what is thePlatonic Socrates if not--Greek words inserted here.. The old theological problem of Faith and Knowledge or moreplainly of instinct and reason--the question whether in respect to thevaluation of things instinct deserves more authority than rationalitywhich wants to appreciate and act according to motives according toa Why that is to say in conformity to purpose and utility--itis always the old moral problem that first appeared in the person ofSocrates and had divided mens minds long before Christianity. Socrateshimself following of course the taste of his talent--that of asurpassing dialectician--took first the side of reason; and in factwhat did he do all his life but laugh at the awkward incapacity of thenoble Athenians who were men of instinct like all noble men and couldnever give satisfactory answers concerning the motives of their actionsIn the end however though silently and secretly he laughed alsoat himself: with his finer conscience and introspection he foundin himself the same difficulty and incapacity. But why--he saidto himself--should one on that account separate oneself from theinstincts! One must set them right and the reason ALSO--one must followthe instincts but at the same time persuade the reason to support themwith good arguments. This was the real FALSENESS of that great andmysterious ironist; he brought his conscience up to the point that hewas satisfied with a kind of self-outwitting: in fact he perceivedthe irrationality in the moral judgment.--Plato more innocent in suchmatters and without the craftiness of the plebeian wished to prove tohimself at the expenditure of all his strength--the greatest strengtha philosopher had ever expended--that reason and instinct leadspontaneously to one goal to the good to God; and since Plato alltheologians and philosophers have followed the same path--which meansthat in matters of morality instinct or as Christians call itFaith or as I call it the herd has hitherto triumphed. Unlessone should make an exception in the case of Descartes the father ofrationalism and consequently the grandfather of the Revolution whorecognized only the authority of reason: but reason is only a tool andDescartes was superficial.. Whoever has followed the history of a single science finds inits development a clue to the understanding of the oldest and commonestprocesses of all knowledge and cognizance: there as here thepremature hypotheses the fictions the good stupid will to beliefand the lack of distrust and patience are first developed--our senseslearn late and never learn completely to be subtle reliable andcautious organs of knowledge. Our eyes find it easier on a givenoccasion to produce a picture already often produced than to seize uponthe divergence and novelty of an impression: the latter requires moreforce more morality. It is difficult and painful for the ear tolisten to anything new; we hear strange music badly. When we hearanother language spoken we involuntarily attempt to form the soundsinto words with which we are more familiar and conversant--it was thusfor example that the Germans modified the spoken word ARCUBALISTA intoARMBRUST cross-bow. Our senses are also hostile and averse to thenew; and generally even in the simplest processes of sensation theemotions DOMINATE--such as fear love hatred and the passive emotionof indolence.--As little as a reader nowadays reads all the single wordsnot to speak of syllables of a page--he rather takes about five outof every twenty words at random and guesses the probably appropriatesense to them--just as little do we see a tree correctly and completelyin respect to its leaves branches colour and shape; we find it somuch easier to fancy the chance of a tree. Even in the midst of themost remarkable experiences we still do just the same; we fabricate thegreater part of the experience and can hardly be made to contemplateany event EXCEPT as inventors thereof. All this goes to provethat from our fundamental nature and from remote ages we havebeen--ACCUSTOMED TO LYING. Or to express it more politely andhypocritically in short more pleasantly--one is much more of an artistthan one is aware of.--In an animated conversation I often see the faceof the person with whom I am speaking so clearly and sharply definedbefore me according to the thought he expresses or which I believe tobe evoked in his mind that the degree of distinctness far exceeds theSTRENGTH of my visual faculty--the delicacy of the play of the musclesand of the expression of the eyes MUST therefore be imagined by me.Probably the person put on quite a different expression or none at all.. Quidquid luce fuit tenebris agit: but also contrariwise. What weexperience in dreams provided we experience it often pertains atlast just as much to the general belongings of our soul as anythingactually experienced; by virtue thereof we are richer or poorer wehave a requirement more or less and finally in broad daylight andeven in the brightest moments of our waking life we are ruled to someextent by the nature of our dreams. Supposing that someone has oftenflown in his dreams and that at last as soon as he dreams he isconscious of the power and art of flying as his privilege and hispeculiarly enviable happiness; such a person who believes that on theslightest impulse he can actualize all sorts of curves and angles whoknows the sensation of a certain divine levity an upwardswithout effort or constraint a downwards without descendingor lowering--without TROUBLE!--how could the man with suchdream-experiences and dream-habits fail to find happiness differentlycoloured and defined even in his waking hours! How could he fail--tolong DIFFERENTLY for happiness Flight such as is described by poetsmust when compared with his own flying be far too earthly muscularviolent far too troublesome for him.. The difference among men does not manifest itself only in thedifference of their lists of desirable things--in their regardingdifferent good things as worth striving for and being disagreed as tothe greater or less value the order of rank of the commonly recognizeddesirable things:--it manifests itself much more in what they regard asactually HAVING and POSSESSING a desirable thing. As regards a womanfor instance the control over her body and her sexual gratificationserves as an amply sufficient sign of ownership and possession to themore modest man; another with a more suspicious and ambitious thirst forpossession sees the questionableness the mere apparentness of suchownership and wishes to have finer tests in order to know especiallywhether the woman not only gives herself to him but also gives up forhis sake what she has or would like to have--only THEN does he look uponher as possessed. A third however has not even here got to the limitof his distrust and his desire for possession: he asks himself whetherthe woman when she gives up everything for him does not perhaps doso for a phantom of him; he wishes first to be thoroughly indeedprofoundly well known; in order to be loved at all he ventures to lethimself be found out. Only then does he feel the beloved one fully inhis possession when she no longer deceives herself about him whenshe loves him just as much for the sake of his devilry and concealedinsatiability as for his goodness patience and spirituality. Oneman would like to possess a nation and he finds all the higher arts ofCagliostro and Catalina suitable for his purpose. Another with a morerefined thirst for possession says to himself: One may not deceivewhere one desires to possess--he is irritated and impatient at the ideathat a mask of him should rule in the hearts of the people: I musttherefore MAKE myself known and first of all learn to know myself!Among helpful and charitable people one almost always finds the awkwardcraftiness which first gets up suitably him who has to be helped asthough for instance he should merit help seek just THEIR help andwould show himself deeply grateful attached and subservient to themfor all help. With these conceits they take control of the needy as aproperty just as in general they are charitable and helpful out of adesire for property. One finds them jealous when they are crossed orforestalled in their charity. Parents involuntarily make something likethemselves out of their children--they call that education; no motherdoubts at the bottom of her heart that the child she has borne isthereby her property no father hesitates about his right to HIS OWNideas and notions of worth. Indeed in former times fathers deemed itright to use their discretion concerning the life or death of the newlyborn as among the ancient Germans. And like the father so also do theteacher the class the priest and the prince still see in every newindividual an unobjectionable opportunity for a new possession. Theconsequence is.... The Jews--a people born for slavery as Tacitus and the wholeancient world say of them; the chosen people among the nations asthey themselves say and believe--the Jews performed the miracle of theinversion of valuations by means of which life on earth obtained a newand dangerous charm for a couple of millenniums. Their prophets fusedinto one the expressions rich godless wicked violentsensual and for the first time coined the word world as a term ofreproach. In this inversion of valuations in which is also includedthe use of the word poor as synonymous with saint and friend thesignificance of the Jewish people is to be found; it is with THEM thatthe SLAVE-INSURRECTION IN MORALS commences.. It is to be INFERRED that there are countless dark bodies near thesun--such as we shall never see. Among ourselves this is an allegory;and the psychologist of morals reads the whole star-writing merely as anallegorical and symbolic language in which much may be unexpressed.. The beast of prey and the man of prey for instance Caesar Borgiaare fundamentally misunderstood nature is misunderstood so long asone seeks a morbidness in the constitution of these healthiest ofall tropical monsters and growths or even an innate hell in them--asalmost all moralists have done hitherto. Does it not seem that there isa hatred of the virgin forest and of the tropics among moralists Andthat the tropical man must be discredited at all costs whetheras disease and deterioration of mankind or as his own hell andself-torture And why In favour of the temperate zones In favourof the temperate men The moral The mediocre--This for the chapter:Morals as Timidity.. All the systems of morals which address themselves with a view totheir happiness as it is called--what else are they but suggestionsfor behaviour adapted to the degree of DANGER from themselves in whichthe individuals live; recipes for their passions their good and badpropensities insofar as such have the Will to Power and would liketo play the master; small and great expediencies and elaborationspermeated with the musty odour of old family medicines and old-wifewisdom; all of them grotesque and absurd in their form--becausethey address themselves to all because they generalize wheregeneralization is not authorized; all of them speaking unconditionallyand taking themselves unconditionally; all of them flavoured not merelywith one grain of salt but rather endurable only and sometimes evenseductive when they are over-spiced and begin to smell dangerouslyespecially of the other world. That is all of little value whenestimated intellectually and is far from being science much lesswisdom; but repeated once more and three times repeated it isexpediency expediency expediency mixed with stupidity stupiditystupidity--whether it be the indifference and statuesque coldnesstowards the heated folly of the emotions which the Stoics advised andfostered; or the no-more-laughing and no-more-weeping of Spinoza thedestruction of the emotions by their analysis and vivisection which herecommended so naively; or the lowering of the emotions to an innocentmean at which they may be satisfied the Aristotelianism of morals;or even morality as the enjoyment of the emotions in a voluntaryattenuation and spiritualization by the symbolism of art perhaps asmusic or as love of God and of mankind for Gods sake--for in religionthe passions are once more enfranchised provided that...; or finallyeven the complaisant and wanton surrender to the emotions as hasbeen taught by Hafis and Goethe the bold letting-go of the reins thespiritual and corporeal licentia morum in the exceptional cases ofwise old codgers and drunkards with whom it no longer has muchdanger.--This also for the chapter: Morals as Timidity.. Inasmuch as in all ages as long as mankind has existed there havealso been human herds family alliances communities tribes peoplesstates churches and always a great number who obey in proportionto the small number who command--in view therefore of the fact thatobedience has been most practiced and fostered among mankind hithertoone may reasonably suppose that generally speaking the need thereof isnow innate in every one as a kind of FORMAL CONSCIENCE which givesthe command Thou shalt unconditionally do something unconditionallyrefrain from something in short Thou shalt. This need tries tosatisfy itself and to fill its form with a content according to itsstrength impatience and eagerness it at once seizes as an omnivorousappetite with little selection and accepts whatever is shouted intoits ear by all sorts of commanders--parents teachers laws classprejudices or public opinion. The extraordinary limitation of humandevelopment the hesitation protractedness frequent retrogression andturning thereof is attributable to the fact that the herd-instinct ofobedience is transmitted best and at the cost of the art of command. Ifone imagine this instinct increasing to its greatest extent commandersand independent individuals will finally be lacking altogether or theywill suffer inwardly from a bad conscience and will have to imposea deception on themselves in the first place in order to be able tocommand just as if they also were only obeying. This condition of thingsactually exists in Europe at present--I call it the moral hypocrisy ofthe commanding class. They know no other way of protecting themselvesfrom their bad conscience than by playing the role of executors of olderand higher orders of predecessors of the constitution of justice ofthe law or of God himself or they even justify themselves by maximsfrom the current opinions of the herd as first servants of theirpeople or instruments of the public weal. On the other hand thegregarious European man nowadays assumes an air as if he were the onlykind of man that is allowable he glorifies his qualities such aspublic spirit kindness deference industry temperance modestyindulgence sympathy by virtue of which he is gentle endurable anduseful to the herd as the peculiarly human virtues. In cases howeverwhere it is believed that the leader and bell-wether cannot be dispensedwith attempt after attempt is made nowadays to replace commandersby the summing together of clever gregarious men all representativeconstitutions for example are of this origin. In spite of all what ablessing what a deliverance from a weight becoming unendurable is theappearance of an absolute ruler for these gregarious Europeans--of thisfact the effect of the appearance of Napoleon was the last great proofthe history of the influence of Napoleon is almost the history ofthe higher happiness to which the entire century has attained in itsworthiest individuals and periods.. The man of an age of dissolution which mixes the races withone another who has the inheritance of a diversified descent in hisbody--that is to say contrary and often not only contrary instinctsand standards of value which struggle with one another and are seldomat peace--such a man of late culture and broken lights will on anaverage be a weak man. His fundamental desire is that the war which isIN HIM should come to an end; happiness appears to him in the characterof a soothing medicine and mode of thought for instance Epicureanor Christian; it is above all things the happiness of repose ofundisturbedness of repletion of final unity--it is the Sabbath ofSabbaths to use the expression of the holy rhetorician St. Augustinewho was himself such a man.--Should however the contrariety andconflict in such natures operate as an ADDITIONAL incentive and stimulusto life--and if on the other hand in addition to their powerful andirreconcilable instincts they have also inherited and indoctrinatedinto them a proper mastery and subtlety for carrying on the conflictwith themselves that is to say the faculty of self-control andself-deception there then arise those marvelously incomprehensible andinexplicable beings those enigmatical men predestined for conqueringand circumventing others the finest examples of which are Alcibiadesand Caesar with whom I should like to associate the FIRST of Europeansaccording to my taste the Hohenstaufen Frederick the Second andamong artists perhaps Leonardo da Vinci. They appear precisely in thesame periods when that weaker type with its longing for repose comesto the front; the two types are complementary to each other and springfrom the same causes.. As long as the utility which determines moral estimates is onlygregarious utility as long as the preservation of the community is onlykept in view and the immoral is sought precisely and exclusively inwhat seems dangerous to the maintenance of the community there can beno morality of love to ones neighbour. Granted even that there isalready a little constant exercise of consideration sympathy fairnessgentleness and mutual assistance granted that even in this conditionof society all those instincts are already active which are latterlydistinguished by honourable names as virtues and eventually almostcoincide with the conception morality: in that period they do notas yet belong to the domain of moral valuations--they are stillULTRA-MORAL. A sympathetic action for instance is neither called goodnor bad moral nor immoral in the best period of the Romans; and shouldit be praised a sort of resentful disdain is compatible with thispraise even at the best directly the sympathetic action is comparedwith one which contributes to the welfare of the whole to the RESPUBLICA. After all love to our neighbour is always a secondarymatter partly conventional and arbitrarily manifested in relation toour FEAR OF OUR NEIGHBOUR. After the fabric of society seems on thewhole established and secured against external dangers it is thisfear of our neighbour which again creates new perspectives of moralvaluation. Certain strong and dangerous instincts such as the love ofenterprise foolhardiness revengefulness astuteness rapacity andlove of power which up till then had not only to be honoured from thepoint of view of general utility--under other names of course thanthose here given--but had to be fostered and cultivated because theywere perpetually required in the common danger against the commonenemies are now felt in their dangerousness to be doubly strong--whenthe outlets for them are lacking--and are gradually branded as immoraland given over to calumny. The contrary instincts and inclinations nowattain to moral honour the gregarious instinct gradually draws itsconclusions. How much or how little dangerousness to the community orto equality is contained in an opinion a condition an emotion adisposition or an endowment--that is now the moral perspective hereagain fear is the mother of morals. It is by the loftiest and strongestinstincts when they break out passionately and carry the individualfar above and beyond the average and the low level of the gregariousconscience that the self-reliance of the community is destroyed itsbelief in itself its backbone as it were breaks consequently thesevery instincts will be most branded and defamed. The lofty independentspirituality the will to stand alone and even the cogent reason arefelt to be dangers everything that elevates the individual above theherd and is a source of fear to the neighbour is henceforth calledEVIL the tolerant unassuming self-adapting self-equalizingdisposition the MEDIOCRITY of desires attains to moral distinction andhonour. Finally under very peaceful circumstances there is alwaysless opportunity and necessity for training the feelings to severityand rigour and now every form of severity even in justice beginsto disturb the conscience a lofty and rigorous nobleness andself-responsibility almost offends and awakens distrust the lamband still more the sheep wins respect. There is a point of diseasedmellowness and effeminacy in the history of society at which societyitself takes the part of him who injures it the part of the CRIMINALand does so in fact seriously and honestly. To punish appears to itto be somehow unfair--it is certain that the idea of punishment andthe obligation to punish are then painful and alarming to people. Isit not sufficient if the criminal be rendered HARMLESS Why should westill punish Punishment itself is terrible!--with these questionsgregarious morality the morality of fear draws its ultimateconclusion. If one could at all do away with danger the cause of fearone would have done away with this morality at the same time itwould no longer be necessary it WOULD NOT CONSIDER ITSELF any longernecessary!--Whoever examines the conscience of the present-day Europeanwill always elicit the same imperative from its thousand moral foldsand hidden recesses the imperative of the timidity of the herd we wishthat some time or other there may be NOTHING MORE TO FEAR! Some timeor other--the will and the way THERETO is nowadays called progress allover Europe.. Let us at once say again what we have already said a hundredtimes for peoples ears nowadays are unwilling to hear such truths--OURtruths. We know well enough how offensive it sounds when any oneplainly and without metaphor counts man among the animals but it willbe accounted to us almost a CRIME that it is precisely in respect tomen of modern ideas that we have constantly applied the terms herdherd-instincts and such like expressions. What avail is it We cannotdo otherwise for it is precisely here that our new insight is. Wehave found that in all the principal moral judgments Europe has becomeunanimous including likewise the countries where European influenceprevails in Europe people evidently KNOW what Socrates thought hedid not know and what the famous serpent of old once promised toteach--they know today what is good and evil. It must then sound hardand be distasteful to the ear when we always insist that that whichhere thinks it knows that which here glorifies itself with praiseand blame and calls itself good is the instinct of the herding humananimal the instinct which has come and is ever coming more and moreto the front to preponderance and supremacy over other instinctsaccording to the increasing physiological approximation and resemblanceof which it is the symptom. MORALITY IN EUROPE AT PRESENT ISHERDING-ANIMAL MORALITY and therefore as we understand the matteronly one kind of human morality beside which before which and afterwhich many other moralities and above all HIGHER moralities are orshould be possible. Against such a possibility against such a shouldbe however this morality defends itself with all its strength itsays obstinately and inexorably I am morality itself and nothing elseis morality! Indeed with the help of a religion which has humouredand flattered the sublimest desires of the herding-animal things havereached such a point that we always find a more visible expression ofthis morality even in political and social arrangements: the DEMOCRATICmovement is the inheritance of the Christian movement. That its TEMPOhowever is much too slow and sleepy for the more impatient ones forthose who are sick and distracted by the herding-instinct is indicatedby the increasingly furious howling and always less disguisedteeth-gnashing of the anarchist dogs who are now roving through thehighways of European culture. Apparently in opposition to the peacefullyindustrious democrats and Revolution-ideologues and still more soto the awkward philosophasters and fraternity-visionaries who callthemselves Socialists and want a free society those are really at onewith them all in their thorough and instinctive hostility to every formof society other than that of the AUTONOMOUS herd to the extent even ofrepudiating the notions master and servant--ni dieu ni maitre saysa socialist formula; at one in their tenacious opposition to everyspecial claim every special right and privilege this means ultimatelyopposition to EVERY right for when all are equal no one needs rightsany longer; at one in their distrust of punitive justice as though itwere a violation of the weak unfair to the NECESSARY consequences ofall former society; but equally at one in their religion of sympathyin their compassion for all that feels lives and suffers down to thevery animals up even to God--the extravagance of sympathy forGod belongs to a democratic age; altogether at one in the cry andimpatience of their sympathy in their deadly hatred of sufferinggenerally in their almost feminine incapacity for witnessing it orALLOWING it; at one in their involuntary beglooming and heart-softeningunder the spell of which Europe seems to be threatened with a newBuddhism; at one in their belief in the morality of MUTUAL sympathy asthough it were morality in itself the climax the ATTAINED climax ofmankind the sole hope of the future the consolation of the presentthe great discharge from all the obligations of the past; altogether atone in their belief in the community as the DELIVERER in the herd andtherefore in themselves.. We who hold a different belief--we who regard the democraticmovement not only as a degenerating form of political organization butas equivalent to a degenerating a waning type of man as involving hismediocrising and depreciation: where have WE to fix our hopes InNEW PHILOSOPHERS--there is no other alternative: in minds strong andoriginal enough to initiate opposite estimates of value to transvalueand invert eternal valuations; in forerunners in men of the futurewho in the present shall fix the constraints and fasten the knots whichwill compel millenniums to take NEW paths. To teach man the futureof humanity as his WILL as depending on human will and to makepreparation for vast hazardous enterprises and collective attempts inrearing and educating in order thereby to put an end to the frightfulrule of folly and chance which has hitherto gone by the name ofhistory the folly of the greatest number is only its lastform--for that purpose a new type of philosopher and commander willsome time or other be needed at the very idea of which everything thathas existed in the way of occult terrible and benevolent beings mightlook pale and dwarfed. The image of such leaders hovers before OUReyes:--is it lawful for me to say it aloud ye free spirits Theconditions which one would partly have to create and partly utilize fortheir genesis; the presumptive methods and tests by virtue of whicha soul should grow up to such an elevation and power as to feel aCONSTRAINT to these tasks; a transvaluation of values under the newpressure and hammer of which a conscience should be steeled and a hearttransformed into brass so as to bear the weight of such responsibility;and on the other hand the necessity for such leaders the dreadfuldanger that they might be lacking or miscarry and degenerate:--theseare OUR real anxieties and glooms ye know it well ye free spirits!these are the heavy distant thoughts and storms which sweep across theheaven of OUR life. There are few pains so grievous as to have seendivined or experienced how an exceptional man has missed his way anddeteriorated; but he who has the rare eye for the universal dangerof man himself DETERIORATING he who like us has recognized theextraordinary fortuitousness which has hitherto played its game inrespect to the future of mankind--a game in which neither the hand noreven a finger of God has participated!--he who divines the fate thatis hidden under the idiotic unwariness and blind confidence ofmodern ideas and still more under the whole of Christo-Europeanmorality--suffers from an anguish with which no other is to be compared.He sees at a glance all that could still BE MADE OUT OF MAN througha favourable accumulation and augmentation of human powers andarrangements; he knows with all the knowledge of his conviction howunexhausted man still is for the greatest possibilities and how oftenin the past the type man has stood in presence of mysterious decisionsand new paths:--he knows still better from his painfulest recollectionson what wretched obstacles promising developments of the highest rankhave hitherto usually gone to pieces broken down sunk and becomecontemptible. The UNIVERSAL DEGENERACY OF MANKIND to the level ofthe man of the future--as idealized by the socialistic fools andshallow-pates--this degeneracy and dwarfing of man to an absolutelygregarious animal or as they call it to a man of free societythis brutalizing of man into a pigmy with equal rights and claims isundoubtedly POSSIBLE! He who has thought out this possibility to itsultimate conclusion knows ANOTHER loathing unknown to the rest ofmankind--and perhaps also a new MISSION!CHAPTER VI. WE SCHOLARS. At the risk that moralizing may also reveal itself here as thatwhich it has always been--namely resolutely MONTRER SES PLAIESaccording to Balzac--I would venture to protest against an improper andinjurious alteration of rank which quite unnoticed and as if with thebest conscience threatens nowadays to establish itself in the relationsof science and philosophy. I mean to say that one must have the rightout of ones own EXPERIENCE--experience as it seems to me alwaysimplies unfortunate experience--to treat of such an important questionof rank so as not to speak of colour like the blind or AGAINST sciencelike women and artists Ah! this dreadful science! sigh their instinctand their shame it always FINDS THINGS OUT!. The declaration ofindependence of the scientific man his emancipation from philosophyis one of the subtler after-effects of democratic organization anddisorganization: the self-glorification and self-conceitedness ofthe learned man is now everywhere in full bloom and in its bestspringtime--which does not mean to imply that in this case self-praisesmells sweet. Here also the instinct of the populace cries Freedomfrom all masters! and after science has with the happiest resultsresisted theology whose hand-maid it had been too long it nowproposes in its wantonness and indiscretion to lay down laws forphilosophy and in its turn to play the master--what am I saying!to play the PHILOSOPHER on its own account. My memory--the memory ofa scientific man if you please!--teems with the naivetes of insolencewhich I have heard about philosophy and philosophers from youngnaturalists and old physicians not to mention the most cultured andmost conceited of all learned men the philologists and schoolmasterswho are both the one and the other by profession. On one occasion itwas the specialist and the Jack Horner who instinctively stood on thedefensive against all synthetic tasks and capabilities; at another timeit was the industrious worker who had got a scent of OTIUM and refinedluxuriousness in the internal economy of the philosopher and felthimself aggrieved and belittled thereby. On another occasion it was thecolour-blindness of the utilitarian who sees nothing in philosophy buta series of REFUTED systems and an extravagant expenditure which doesnobody any good. At another time the fear of disguised mysticism and ofthe boundary-adjustment of knowledge became conspicuous at anothertime the disregard of individual philosophers which had involuntarilyextended to disregard of philosophy generally. In fine I found mostfrequently behind the proud disdain of philosophy in young scholarsthe evil after-effect of some particular philosopher to whom on thewhole obedience had been foresworn without however the spell of hisscornful estimates of other philosophers having been got rid of--theresult being a general ill-will to all philosophy. Such seems tome for instance the after-effect of Schopenhauer on the most modernGermany: by his unintelligent rage against Hegel he has succeeded insevering the whole of the last generation of Germans from its connectionwith German culture which culture all things considered has beenan elevation and a divining refinement of the HISTORICAL SENSE butprecisely at this point Schopenhauer himself was poor irreceptiveand un-German to the extent of ingeniousness. On the whole speakinggenerally it may just have been the humanness all-too-humanness of themodern philosophers themselves in short their contemptibleness whichhas injured most radically the reverence for philosophy and opened thedoors to the instinct of the populace. Let it but be acknowledged towhat an extent our modern world diverges from the whole style of theworld of Heraclitus Plato Empedocles and whatever else all the royaland magnificent anchorites of the spirit were called and with whatjustice an honest man of science MAY feel himself of a better family andorigin in view of such representatives of philosophy who owing tothe fashion of the present day are just as much aloft as they are downbelow--in Germany for instance the two lions of Berlin the anarchistEugen Duhring and the amalgamist Eduard von Hartmann. It is especiallythe sight of those hotch-potch philosophers who call themselvesrealists or positivists which is calculated to implant adangerous distrust in the soul of a young and ambitious scholar thosephilosophers at the best are themselves but scholars and specialiststhat is very evident! All of them are persons who have been vanquishedand BROUGHT BACK AGAIN under the dominion of science who at one timeor another claimed more from themselves without having a right to themore and its responsibility--and who now creditably rancorously andvindictively represent in word and deed DISBELIEF in the master-taskand supremacy of philosophy After all how could it be otherwiseScience flourishes nowadays and has the good conscience clearly visibleon its countenance while that to which the entire modern philosophy hasgradually sunk the remnant of philosophy of the present day excitesdistrust and displeasure if not scorn and pity Philosophy reduced toa theory of knowledge no more in fact than a diffident science ofepochs and doctrine of forbearance a philosophy that never evengets beyond the threshold and rigorously DENIES itself the rightto enter--that is philosophy in its last throes an end an agonysomething that awakens pity. How could such a philosophy--RULE!. The dangers that beset the evolution of the philosopher are infact so manifold nowadays that one might doubt whether this fruitcould still come to maturity. The extent and towering structure of thesciences have increased enormously and therewith also the probabilitythat the philosopher will grow tired even as a learner or will attachhimself somewhere and specialize so that he will no longer attain tohis elevation that is to say to his superspection his circumspectionand his DESPECTION. Or he gets aloft too late when the best of hismaturity and strength is past or when he is impaired coarsened anddeteriorated so that his view his general estimate of things is nolonger of much importance. It is perhaps just the refinement of hisintellectual conscience that makes him hesitate and linger on theway he dreads the temptation to become a dilettante a millepede amilleantenna he knows too well that as a discerner one who has losthis self-respect no longer commands no longer LEADS unless he shouldaspire to become a great play-actor a philosophical Cagliostro andspiritual rat-catcher--in short a misleader. This is in the lastinstance a question of taste if it has not really been a question ofconscience. To double once more the philosophers difficulties there isalso the fact that he demands from himself a verdict a Yea or Nay notconcerning science but concerning life and the worth of life--he learnsunwillingly to believe that it is his right and even his duty to obtainthis verdict and he has to seek his way to the right and the beliefonly through the most extensive perhaps disturbing and destroyingexperiences often hesitating doubting and dumbfounded. In fact thephilosopher has long been mistaken and confused by the multitude eitherwith the scientific man and ideal scholar or with the religiouslyelevated desensualized desecularized visionary and God-intoxicatedman; and even yet when one hears anybody praised because he liveswisely or as a philosopher it hardly means anything more thanprudently and apart. Wisdom: that seems to the populace to be a kindof flight a means and artifice for withdrawing successfully from abad game; but the GENUINE philosopher--does it not seem so to USmy friends--lives unphilosophically and unwisely above allIMPRUDENTLY and feels the obligation and burden of a hundred attemptsand temptations of life--he risks HIMSELF constantly he plays THIS badgame.. In relation to the genius that is to say a being who eitherENGENDERS or PRODUCES--both words understood in their fullest sense--theman of learning the scientific average man has always something ofthe old maid about him; for like her he is not conversant with the twoprincipal functions of man. To both of course to the scholar andto the old maid one concedes respectability as if by way ofindemnification--in these cases one emphasizes the respectability--andyet in the compulsion of this concession one has the same admixtureof vexation. Let us examine more closely: what is the scientific manFirstly a commonplace type of man with commonplace virtues: that isto say a non-ruling non-authoritative and non-self-sufficient typeof man; he possesses industry patient adaptableness to rank and fileequability and moderation in capacity and requirement; he has theinstinct for people like himself and for that which they require--forinstance: the portion of independence and green meadow without whichthere is no rest from labour the claim to honour and considerationwhich first and foremost presupposes recognition and recognisabilitythe sunshine of a good name the perpetual ratification of his value andusefulness with which the inward DISTRUST which lies at the bottom ofthe heart of all dependent men and gregarious animals has again andagain to be overcome. The learned man as is appropriate has alsomaladies and faults of an ignoble kind: he is full of petty envy andhas a lynx-eye for the weak points in those natures to whose elevationshe cannot attain. He is confiding yet only as one who lets himself gobut does not FLOW; and precisely before the man of the great current hestands all the colder and more reserved--his eye is then like a smoothand irresponsive lake which is no longer moved by rapture or sympathy.The worst and most dangerous thing of which a scholar is capable resultsfrom the instinct of mediocrity of his type from the Jesuitism ofmediocrity which labours instinctively for the destruction ofthe exceptional man and endeavours to break--or still better torelax--every bent bow To relax of course with consideration andnaturally with an indulgent hand--to RELAX with confiding sympathythat is the real art of Jesuitism which has always understood how tointroduce itself as the religion of sympathy.. However gratefully one may welcome the OBJECTIVE spirit--andwho has not been sick to death of all subjectivity and its confoundedIPSISIMOSITY!--in the end however one must learn caution even withregard to ones gratitude and put a stop to the exaggeration withwhich the unselfing and depersonalizing of the spirit has recently beencelebrated as if it were the goal in itself as if it were salvationand glorification--as is especially accustomed to happen in thepessimist school which has also in its turn good reasons for paying thehighest honours to disinterested knowledge The objective man who nolonger curses and scolds like the pessimist the IDEAL man of learningin whom the scientific instinct blossoms forth fully after a thousandcomplete and partial failures is assuredly one of the most costlyinstruments that exist but his place is in the hand of one who is morepowerful He is only an instrument we may say he is a MIRROR--he is nopurpose in himself The objective man is in truth a mirror accustomedto prostration before everything that wants to be known with suchdesires only as knowing or reflecting implies--he waits untilsomething comes and then expands himself sensitively so that even thelight footsteps and gliding-past of spiritual beings may not be lost onhis surface and film Whatever personality he still possesses seems tohim accidental arbitrary or still oftener disturbing so much has hecome to regard himself as the passage and reflection of outside formsand events He calls up the recollection of himself with an effortand not infrequently wrongly he readily confounds himself with otherpersons he makes mistakes with regard to his own needs and here onlyis he unrefined and negligent Perhaps he is troubled about the healthor the pettiness and confined atmosphere of wife and friend or the lackof companions and society--indeed he sets himself to reflect on hissuffering but in vain! His thoughts already rove away to the MOREGENERAL case and tomorrow he knows as little as he knew yesterday howto help himself He does not now take himself seriously and devote timeto himself he is serene NOT from lack of trouble but from lackof capacity for grasping and dealing with HIS trouble The habitualcomplaisance with respect to all objects and experiences the radiantand impartial hospitality with which he receives everything thatcomes his way his habit of inconsiderate good-nature of dangerousindifference as to Yea and Nay: alas! there are enough of cases in whichhe has to atone for these virtues of his!--and as man generally hebecomes far too easily the CAPUT MORTUUM of such virtues. Should onewish love or hatred from him--I mean love and hatred as God woman andanimal understand them--he will do what he can and furnish what he can.But one must not be surprised if it should not be much--if he shouldshow himself just at this point to be false fragile questionable anddeteriorated. His love is constrained his hatred is artificial andrather UN TOUR DE FORCE a slight ostentation and exaggeration. He isonly genuine so far as he can be objective; only in his serene totalityis he still nature and natural. His mirroring and eternallyself-polishing soul no longer knows how to affirm no longer how todeny; he does not command; neither does he destroy. JE NE MEPRISEPRESQUE RIEN--he says with Leibniz: let us not overlook nor undervaluethe PRESQUE! Neither is he a model man; he does not go in advance of anyone nor after either; he places himself generally too far off to haveany reason for espousing the cause of either good or evil. If he hasbeen so long confounded with the PHILOSOPHER with the Caesarian trainerand dictator of civilization he has had far too much honour and whatis more essential in him has been overlooked--he is an instrumentsomething of a slave though certainly the sublimest sort of slave butnothing in himself--PRESQUE RIEN! The objective man is an instrumenta costly easily injured easily tarnished measuring instrument andmirroring apparatus which is to be taken care of and respected; but heis no goal not outgoing nor upgoing no complementary man in whom theREST of existence justifies itself no termination--and still less acommencement an engendering or primary cause nothing hardy powerfulself-centred that wants to be master; but rather only a soft inflateddelicate movable potters-form that must wait for some kind of contentand frame to shape itself thereto--for the most part a man withoutframe and content a selfless man. Consequently also nothing forwomen IN PARENTHESI.. When a philosopher nowadays makes known that he is not a skeptic--Ihope that has been gathered from the foregoing description of theobjective spirit--people all hear it impatiently; they regard him onthat account with some apprehension they would like to ask so manymany questions... indeed among timid hearers of whom there are now somany he is henceforth said to be dangerous. With his repudiation ofskepticism it seems to them as if they heard some evil-threateningsound in the distance as if a new kind of explosive were being triedsomewhere a dynamite of the spirit perhaps a newly discovered RussianNIHILINE a pessimism BONAE VOLUNTATIS that not only denies meansdenial but--dreadful thought! PRACTISES denial. Against this kind ofgood-will--a will to the veritable actual negation of life--there isas is generally acknowledged nowadays no better soporific and sedativethan skepticism the mild pleasing lulling poppy of skepticism;and Hamlet himself is now prescribed by the doctors of the day as anantidote to the spirit and its underground noises. Are not our earsalready full of bad sounds say the skeptics as lovers of repose andalmost as a kind of safety police; this subterranean Nay is terrible!Be still ye pessimistic moles! The skeptic in effect that delicatecreature is far too easily frightened; his conscience is schooled soas to start at every Nay and even at that sharp decided Yea and feelssomething like a bite thereby. Yea! and Nay!--they seem to him opposedto morality; he loves on the contrary to make a festival to his virtueby a noble aloofness while perhaps he says with Montaigne: What do Iknow Or with Socrates: I know that I know nothing. Or: Here I donot trust myself no door is open to me. Or: Even if the door wereopen why should I enter immediately Or: What is the use of any hastyhypotheses It might quite well be in good taste to make no hypothesesat all. Are you absolutely obliged to straighten at once what iscrooked to stuff every hole with some kind of oakum Is there not timeenough for that Has not the time leisure Oh ye demons can ye notat all WAIT The uncertain also has its charms the Sphinx too is aCirce and Circe too was a philosopher.--Thus does a skeptic consolehimself; and in truth he needs some consolation. For skepticism isthe most spiritual expression of a certain many-sided physiologicaltemperament which in ordinary language is called nervous debility andsickliness; it arises whenever races or classes which have been longseparated decisively and suddenly blend with one another. In the newgeneration which has inherited as it were different standards andvaluations in its blood everything is disquiet derangement doubt andtentativeness; the best powers operate restrictively the very virtuesprevent each other growing and becoming strong equilibrium ballastand perpendicular stability are lacking in body and soul. That howeverwhich is most diseased and degenerated in such nondescripts is theWILL; they are no longer familiar with independence of decision orthe courageous feeling of pleasure in willing--they are doubtful of thefreedom of the will even in their dreams Our present-day Europethe scene of a senseless precipitate attempt at a radical blending ofclasses and CONSEQUENTLY of races is therefore skeptical in all itsheights and depths sometimes exhibiting the mobile skepticism whichsprings impatiently and wantonly from branch to branch sometimes withgloomy aspect like a cloud over-charged with interrogative signs--andoften sick unto death of its will! Paralysis of will where do we notfind this cripple sitting nowadays! And yet how bedecked oftentimes Howseductively ornamented!

The time forpetty politics is past; the next century will bring the struggle for thedominion of the world--the COMPULSION to great politics.. As to how far the new warlike age on which we Europeans haveevidently entered may perhaps favour the growth of another and strongerkind of skepticism I should like to express myself preliminarilymerely by a parable which the lovers of German history will alreadyunderstand. That unscrupulous enthusiast for big handsome grenadierswho as King of Prussia brought into being a military and skepticalgenius--and therewith in reality the new and now triumphantly emergedtype of German the problematic crazy father of Frederick the Greathad on one point the very knack and lucky grasp of the genius: he knewwhat was then lacking in Germany the want of which was a hundred timesmore alarming and serious than any lack of culture and social form--hisill-will to the young Frederick resulted from the anxiety of a profoundinstinct. MEN WERE LACKING; and he suspected to his bitterest regretthat his own son was not man enough. There however he deceivedhimself; but who would not have deceived himself in his place He sawhis son lapsed to atheism to the ESPRIT to the pleasant frivolity ofclever Frenchmen--he saw in the background the great bloodsucker thespider skepticism; he suspected the incurable wretchedness of a heart nolonger hard enough either for evil or good and of a broken will that nolonger commands is no longer ABLE to command. Meanwhile howeverthere grew up in his son that new kind of harder and more dangerousskepticism--who knows TO WHAT EXTENT it was encouraged just byhis fathers hatred and the icy melancholy of a will condemned tosolitude--the skepticism of daring manliness which is closely relatedto the genius for war and conquest and made its first entrance intoGermany in the person of the great Frederick. This skepticism despisesand nevertheless grasps; it undermines and takes possession; it doesnot believe but it does not thereby lose itself; it gives the spirit adangerous liberty but it keeps strict guard over the heart. It is theGERMAN form of skepticism which as a continued Fredericianism risento the highest spirituality has kept Europe for a considerable timeunder the dominion of the German spirit and its critical and historicaldistrust Owing to the insuperably strong and tough masculine characterof the great German philologists and historical critics whorightly estimated were also all of them artists of destructionand dissolution a NEW conception of the German spirit graduallyestablished itself--in spite of all Romanticism in music andphilosophy--in which the leaning towards masculine skepticism wasdecidedly prominent whether for instance as fearlessness of gaze ascourage and sternness of the dissecting hand or as resolute will todangerous voyages of discovery to spiritualized North Pole expeditionsunder barren and dangerous skies. There may be good grounds for it whenwarm-blooded and superficial humanitarians cross themselves before thisspirit CET ESPRIT FATALISTE IRONIQUE MEPHISTOPHELIQUE as Micheletcalls it not without a shudder. But if one would realize howcharacteristic is this fear of the man in the German spirit whichawakened Europe out of its dogmatic slumber let us call to mind theformer conception which had to be overcome by this new one--and thatit is not so very long ago that a masculinized woman could dare withunbridled presumption to recommend the Germans to the interest ofEurope as gentle good-hearted weak-willed and poetical fools.Finally let us only understand profoundly enough Napoleonsastonishment when he saw Goethe it reveals what had been regarded forcenturies as the German spirit VOILA UN HOMME!--that was as much asto say But this is a MAN! And I only expected to see a German!. Supposing then that in the picture of the philosophers of thefuture some trait suggests the question whether they must not perhapsbe skeptics in the last-mentioned sense something in them would only bedesignated thereby--and not they themselves. With equal right they mightcall themselves critics and assuredly they will be men of experiments.By the name with which I ventured to baptize them I have alreadyexpressly emphasized their attempting and their love of attempting isthis because as critics in body and soul they will love to make useof experiments in a new and perhaps wider and more dangerous sense Intheir passion for knowledge will they have to go further in daring andpainful attempts than the sensitive and pampered taste of a democraticcentury can approve of--There is no doubt these coming ones will beleast able to dispense with the serious and not unscrupulous qualitieswhich distinguish the critic from the skeptic I mean the certainty as tostandards of worth the conscious employment of a unity of methodthe wary courage the standing-alone and the capacity forself-responsibility indeed they will avow among themselves a DELIGHTin denial and dissection and a certain considerate cruelty which knowshow to handle the knife surely and deftly even when the heart bleedsThey will be STERNER and perhaps not always towards themselves onlythan humane people may desire they will not deal with the truth inorder that it may please them or elevate and inspire them--theywill rather have little faith in TRUTH bringing with it such revelsfor the feelings. They will smile those rigorous spirits when any onesays in their presence That thought elevates me why should it not betrue or That work enchants me why should it not be beautiful orThat artist enlarges me why should he not be great Perhaps theywill not only have a smile but a genuine disgust for all that is thusrapturous idealistic feminine and hermaphroditic and if any onecould look into their inmost hearts he would not easily find thereinthe intention to reconcile Christian sentiments with antique tasteor even with modern parliamentarism the kind of reconciliationnecessarily found even among philosophers in our very uncertain andconsequently very conciliatory century. Critical discipline and everyhabit that conduces to purity and rigour in intellectual matterswill not only be demanded from themselves by these philosophers ofthe future they may even make a display thereof as their specialadornment--nevertheless they will not want to be called critics on thataccount. It will seem to them no small indignity to philosophy tohave it decreed as is so welcome nowadays that philosophy itself iscriticism and critical science--and nothing else whatever! Though thisestimate of philosophy may enjoy the approval of all the Positivists ofFrance and Germany and possibly it even flattered the heart and tasteof KANT: let us call to mind the titles of his principal works our newphilosophers will say notwithstanding that critics are instruments ofthe philosopher and just on that account as instruments they arefar from being philosophers themselves! Even the great Chinaman ofKonigsberg was only a great critic.. I insist upon it that people finally cease confoundingphilosophical workers and in general scientific men withphilosophers--that precisely here one should strictly give each hisown and not give those far too much these far too little. It maybe necessary for the education of the real philosopher that he himselfshould have once stood upon all those steps upon which his servantsthe scientific workers of philosophy remain standing and MUST remainstanding he himself must perhaps have been critic and dogmatistand historian and besides poet and collector and traveler andriddle-reader and moralist and seer and free spirit and almosteverything in order to traverse the whole range of human valuesand estimations and that he may BE ABLE with a variety of eyes andconsciences to look from a height to any distance from a depth upto any height from a nook into any expanse. But all these are onlypreliminary conditions for his task; this task itself demands somethingelse--it requires him TO CREATE VALUES. The philosophical workers afterthe excellent pattern of Kant and Hegel have to fix and formalize somegreat existing body of valuations--that is to say former DETERMINATIONSOF VALUE creations of value which have become prevalent and are fora time called truths--whether in the domain of the LOGICAL thePOLITICAL moral or the ARTISTIC. It is for these investigators tomake whatever has happened and been esteemed hitherto conspicuousconceivable intelligible and manageable to shorten everything longeven time itself and to SUBJUGATE the entire past: an immense andwonderful task in the carrying out of which all refined pride alltenacious will can surely find satisfaction. THE REAL PHILOSOPHERSHOWEVER ARE COMMANDERS AND LAW-GIVERS; they say: Thus SHALL it be!They determine first the Whither and the Why of mankind and therebyset aside the previous labour of all philosophical workers and allsubjugators of the past--they grasp at the future with a creativehand and whatever is and was becomes for them thereby a means aninstrument and a hammer. Their knowing is CREATING their creatingis a law-giving their will to truth is--WILL TO POWER.--Are there atpresent such philosophers Have there ever been such philosophers MUSTthere not be such philosophers some day .... It is always more obvious to me that the philosopher as a manINDISPENSABLE for the morrow and the day after the morrow has everfound himself and HAS BEEN OBLIGED to find himself in contradictionto the day in which he lives; his enemy has always been the ideal of hisday. Hitherto all those extraordinary furtherers of humanity whom onecalls philosophers--who rarely regarded themselves as lovers of wisdombut rather as disagreeable fools and dangerous interrogators--have foundtheir mission their hard involuntary imperative mission in the endhowever the greatness of their mission in being the bad conscience oftheir age. In putting the vivisectors knife to the breast of the veryVIRTUES OF THEIR AGE they have betrayed their own secret; it has beenfor the sake of a NEW greatness of man a new untrodden path tohis aggrandizement. They have always disclosed how much hypocrisyindolence self-indulgence and self-neglect how much falsehood wasconcealed under the most venerated types of contemporary morality howmuch virtue was OUTLIVED they have always said We must remove hence towhere YOU are least at home In the face of a world of modern ideaswhich would like to confine every one in a corner in a specialty aphilosopher if there could be philosophers nowadays would be compelledto place the greatness of man the conception of greatness preciselyin his comprehensiveness and multifariousness in his all-roundness hewould even determine worth and rank according to the amount and varietyof that which a man could bear and take upon himself according to theEXTENT to which a man could stretch his responsibility Nowadays thetaste and virtue of the age weaken and attenuate the will nothing isso adapted to the spirit of the age as weakness of will consequently inthe ideal of the philosopher strength of will sternness and capacityfor prolonged resolution must specially be included in the conceptionof greatness with as good a right as the opposite doctrine with itsideal of a silly renouncing humble selfless humanity was suited toan opposite age--such as the sixteenth century which suffered from itsaccumulated energy of will and from the wildest torrents and floodsof selfishness In the time of Socrates among men only of worn-outinstincts old conservative Athenians who let themselves go--for thesake of happiness as they said for the sake of pleasure as theirconduct indicated--and who had continually on their lips the old pompouswords to which they had long forfeited the right by the life they ledIRONY was perhaps necessary for greatness of soul the wicked Socraticassurance of the old physician and plebeian who cut ruthlessly into hisown flesh as into the flesh and heart of the noble with a look thatsaid plainly enough Do not dissemble before me! here--we are equal!At present on the contrary when throughout Europe the herding-animalalone attains to honours and dispenses honours when equality ofright can too readily be transformed into equality in wrong--I mean tosay into general war against everything rare strange and privilegedagainst the higher man the higher soul the higher duty the higherresponsibility the creative plenipotence and lordliness--at presentit belongs to the conception of greatness to be noble to wish to beapart to be capable of being different to stand alone to have to liveby personal initiative and the philosopher will betray something of hisown ideal when he asserts He shall be the greatest who can be the mostsolitary the most concealed the most divergent the man beyond goodand evil the master of his virtues and of super-abundance of will;precisely this shall be called GREATNESS: as diversified as can beentire as ample as can be full. And to ask once more the question: Isgreatness POSSIBLE--nowadays. It is difficult to learn what a philosopher is because it cannotbe taught: one must know it by experience--or one should have thepride NOT to know it. The fact that at present people all talk of thingsof which they CANNOT have any experience is true more especiallyand unfortunately as concerns the philosopher and philosophicalmatters:--the very few know them are permitted to know them andall popular ideas about them are false. Thus for instance the trulyphilosophical combination of a bold exuberant spirituality which runsat presto pace and a dialectic rigour and necessity which makes nofalse step is unknown to most thinkers and scholars from their ownexperience and therefore should any one speak of it in theirpresence it is incredible to them. They conceive of every necessity astroublesome as a painful compulsory obedience and state of constraint;thinking itself is regarded by them as something slow and hesitatingalmost as a trouble and often enough as worthy of the SWEAT of thenoble--but not at all as something easy and divine closely relatedto dancing and exuberance! To think and to take a matter seriouslyarduously--that is one and the same thing to them; such only has beentheir experience.--Artists have here perhaps a finer intuition; theywho know only too well that precisely when they no longer do anythingarbitrarily and everything of necessity their feeling of freedomof subtlety of power of creatively fixing disposing and shapingreaches its climax--in short that necessity and freedom of will arethen the same thing with them. There is in fine a gradation of rankin psychical states to which the gradation of rank in the problemscorresponds; and the highest problems repel ruthlessly every one whoventures too near them without being predestined for their solutionby the loftiness and power of his spirituality. Of what use is it fornimble everyday intellects or clumsy honest mechanics and empiriciststo press in their plebeian ambition close to such problems and asit were into this holy of holies--as so often happens nowadays! Butcoarse feet must never tread upon such carpets: this is provided for inthe primary law of things; the doors remain closed to those intrudersthough they may dash and break their heads thereon. People have alwaysto be born to a high station or more definitely they have to be BREDfor it: a person has only a right to philosophy--taking the word inits higher significance--in virtue of his descent; the ancestors theblood decide here also. Many generations must have prepared the wayfor the coming of the philosopher; each of his virtues must have beenseparately acquired nurtured transmitted and embodied; not only thebold easy delicate course and current of his thoughts but above allthe readiness for great responsibilities the majesty of ruling glanceand contemning look the feeling of separation from the multitude withtheir duties and virtues the kindly patronage and defense of whateveris misunderstood and calumniated be it God or devil the delight andpractice of supreme justice the art of commanding the amplitude ofwill the lingering eye which rarely admires rarely looks up rarelyloves....CHAPTER VII. OUR VIRTUES. OUR Virtues--It is probable that we too have still our virtuesalthough naturally they are not those sincere and massive virtues onaccount of which we hold our grandfathers in esteem and also at a littledistance from us. We Europeans of the day after tomorrow we firstlingsof the twentieth century--with all our dangerous curiosity ourmultifariousness and art of disguising our mellow and seeminglysweetened cruelty in sense and spirit--we shall presumably IF we musthave virtues have those only which have come to agreement with our mostsecret and heartfelt inclinations with our most ardent requirements:well then let us look for them in our labyrinths!--where as we knowso many things lose themselves so many things get quite lost! And isthere anything finer than to SEARCH for ones own virtues Is it notalmost to BELIEVE in ones own virtues But this believing in onesown virtues--is it not practically the same as what was formerly calledones good conscience that long respectable pigtail of an ideawhich our grandfathers used to hang behind their heads and often enoughalso behind their understandings It seems therefore that howeverlittle we may imagine ourselves to be old-fashioned and grandfatherlyrespectable in other respects in one thing we are nevertheless theworthy grandchildren of our grandfathers we last Europeans with goodconsciences: we also still wear their pigtail.--Ah! if you only knew howsoon so very soon--it will be different!. As in the stellar firmament there are sometimes two suns whichdetermine the path of one planet and in certain cases suns of differentcolours shine around a single planet now with red light now withgreen and then simultaneously illumine and flood it with motleycolours: so we modern men owing to the complicated mechanism of ourfirmament are determined by DIFFERENT moralities; our actions shinealternately in different colours and are seldom unequivocal--and thereare often cases also in which our actions are MOTLEY-COLOURED.. To love ones enemies I think that has been well learnt: it takesplace thousands of times at present on a large and small scale; indeedat times the higher and sublimer thing takes place:--we learn to DESPISEwhen we love and precisely when we love best; all of it howeverunconsciously without noise without ostentation with the shame andsecrecy of goodness which forbids the utterance of the pompous wordand the formula of virtue. Morality as attitude--is opposed to our tastenowadays. This is ALSO an advance as it was an advance in our fathersthat religion as an attitude finally became opposed to their tasteincluding the enmity and Voltairean bitterness against religion and allthat formerly belonged to freethinker-pantomime. It is the music in ourconscience the dance in our spirit to which Puritan litanies moralsermons and goody-goodness wont chime.. Let us be careful in dealing with those who attach great importanceto being credited with moral tact and subtlety in moral discernment!They never forgive us if they have once made a mistake BEFORE usor even with REGARD to us--they inevitably become our instinctivecalumniators and detractors even when they still remain ourfriends.--Blessed are the forgetful: for they get the better even oftheir blunders.. The psychologists of France--and where else are there stillpsychologists nowadays--have never yet exhausted their bitter andmanifold enjoyment of the betise bourgeoise just as though... inshort they betray something thereby. Flaubert for instance the honestcitizen of Rouen neither saw heard nor tasted anything else in theend; it was his mode of self-torment and refined cruelty. As this isgrowing wearisome I would now recommend for a change something elsefor a pleasure--namely the unconscious astuteness with which good fathonest mediocrity always behaves towards loftier spirits and the tasksthey have to perform the subtle barbed Jesuitical astuteness whichis a thousand times subtler than the taste and understanding of themiddle-class in its best moments--subtler even than the understanding ofits victims:--a repeated proof that instinct is the most intelligentof all kinds of intelligence which have hitherto been discovered. Inshort you psychologists study the philosophy of the rule in itsstruggle with the exception: there you have a spectacle fit for Godsand godlike malignity! Or in plainer words practise vivisection ongood people on the homo bonae voluntatis ON YOURSELVES!. The practice of judging and condemning morally is the favouriterevenge of the intellectually shallow on those who are less so it isalso a kind of indemnity for their being badly endowed by natureand finally it is an opportunity for acquiring spirit and BECOMINGsubtle--malice spiritualises. They are glad in their inmost heart thatthere is a standard according to which those who are over-endowed withintellectual goods and privileges are equal to them they contend forthe equality of all before God and almost NEED the belief in God forthis purpose. It is among them that the most powerful antagonists ofatheism are found. If any one were to say to them A lofty spiritualityis beyond all comparison with the honesty and respectability of a merelymoral man--it would make them furious I shall take care not to sayso. I would rather flatter them with my theory that lofty spiritualityitself exists only as the ultimate product of moral qualities that itis a synthesis of all qualities attributed to the merely moral manafter they have been acquired singly through long training and practiceperhaps during a whole series of generations that lofty spiritualityis precisely the spiritualising of justice and the beneficent severitywhich knows that it is authorized to maintain GRADATIONS OF RANK in theworld even among things--and not only among men.. Now that the praise of the disinterested person is so popularone must--probably not without some danger--get an idea of WHAT peopleactually take an interest in and what are the things generally whichfundamentally and profoundly concern ordinary men--including thecultured even the learned and perhaps philosophers also ifappearances do not deceive. The fact thereby becomes obvious that thegreater part of what interests and charms higher natures and morerefined and fastidious tastes seems absolutely uninteresting tothe average man--if notwithstanding he perceive devotion to theseinterests he calls it desinteresse and wonders how it is possible toact disinterestedly. There have been philosophers who could give thispopular astonishment a seductive and mystical other-worldly expressionperhaps because they did not know the higher nature by experienceinstead of stating the naked and candidly reasonable truth thatdisinterested action is very interesting and interested actionprovided that... And love--What! Even an action for loves sakeshall be unegoistic But you fools--! And the praise of theself-sacrificer--But whoever has really offered sacrifice knows thathe wanted and obtained something for it--perhaps something from himselffor something from himself; that he relinquished here in order to havemore there perhaps in general to be more or even feel himself more.But this is a realm of questions and answers in which a more fastidiousspirit does not like to stay: for here truth has to stifle her yawns somuch when she is obliged to answer. And after all truth is a woman; onemust not use force with her.. It sometimes happens said a moralistic pedant andtrifle-retailer that I honour and respect an unselfish man: nothowever because he is unselfish but because I think he has a right tobe useful to another man at his own expense. In short the questionis always who HE is and who THE OTHER is. For instance in a personcreated and destined for command self-denial and modest retirementinstead of being virtues would be the waste of virtues: so it seemsto me. Every system of unegoistic morality which takes itselfunconditionally and appeals to every one not only sins against goodtaste but is also an incentive to sins of omission an ADDITIONALseduction under the mask of philanthropy--and precisely a seduction andinjury to the higher rarer and more privileged types of men. Moralsystems must be compelled first of all to bow before the GRADATIONS OFRANK; their presumption must be driven home to their conscience--untilthey thoroughly understand at last that it is IMMORAL to say that whatis right for one is proper for another.--So said my moralistic pedantand bonhomme. Did he perhaps deserve to be laughed at when he thusexhorted systems of morals to practise morality But one should not betoo much in the right if one wishes to have the laughers on ONES OWNside; a grain of wrong pertains even to good taste.. Wherever sympathy fellow-suffering is preached nowadays--andif I gather rightly no other religion is any longer preached--let thepsychologist have his ears open through all the vanity through all thenoise which is natural to these preachers as to all preachers he willhear a hoarse groaning genuine note of SELF-CONTEMPT. It belongsto the overshadowing and uglifying of Europe which has been onthe increase for a century the first symptoms of which are alreadyspecified documentarily in a thoughtful letter of Galiani to MadamedEpinay--IF IT IS NOT REALLY THE CAUSE THEREOF! The man ofmodern ideas the conceited ape is excessively dissatisfied withhimself--this is perfectly certain. He suffers and his vanity wants himonly to suffer with his fellows.. The hybrid European--a tolerably ugly plebeian taken all inall--absolutely requires a costume: he needs history as a storeroomof costumes. To be sure he notices that none of the costumes fit himproperly--he changes and changes. Let us look at the nineteenth centurywith respect to these hasty preferences and changes in its masqueradesof style and also with respect to its moments of desperation on accountof nothing suiting us. It is in vain to get ourselves up as romanticor classical or Christian or Florentine or barocco or nationalin moribus et artibus: it does not clothe us! But the spiritespecially the historical spirit profits even by this desperation:once and again a new sample of the past or of the foreign is testedput on taken off packed up and above all studied--we are the firststudious age in puncto of costumes I mean as concerns moralsarticles of belief artistic tastes and religions; we are prepared asno other age has ever been for a carnival in the grand style for themost spiritual festival--laughter and arrogance for the transcendentalheight of supreme folly and Aristophanic ridicule of the world. Perhapswe are still discovering the domain of our invention just here thedomain where even we can still be original probably as parodists ofthe worlds history and as Gods Merry-Andrews--perhaps though nothingelse of the present have a future our laughter itself may have afuture!. The historical sense or the capacity for divining quicklythe order of rank of the valuations according to which a people acommunity or an individual has lived the divining instinct for therelationships of these valuations for the relation of the authorityof the valuations to the authority of the operating forces--thishistorical sense which we Europeans claim as our specialty has cometo us in the train of the enchanting and mad semi-barbarity into whichEurope has been plunged by the democratic mingling of classes andraces--it is only the nineteenth century that has recognized thisfaculty as its sixth sense. Owing to this mingling the past of everyform and mode of life and of cultures which were formerly closelycontiguous and superimposed on one another flows forth into us modernsouls; our instincts now run back in all directions we ourselves area kind of chaos: in the end as we have said the spirit perceives itsadvantage therein. By means of our semi-barbarity in body and in desirewe have secret access everywhere such as a noble age never had; we haveaccess above all to the labyrinth of imperfect civilizations and toevery form of semi-barbarity that has at any time existed on earth; andin so far as the most considerable part of human civilization hithertohas just been semi-barbarity the historical sense implies almost thesense and instinct for everything the taste and tongue for everything:whereby it immediately proves itself to be an IGNOBLE sense. Forinstance we enjoy Homer once more: it is perhaps our happiestacquisition that we know how to appreciate Homer whom men ofdistinguished culture as the French of the seventeenth century likeSaint-Evremond who reproached him for his ESPRIT VASTE and evenVoltaire the last echo of the century cannot and could not so easilyappropriate--whom they scarcely permitted themselves to enjoy. The verydecided Yea and Nay of their palate their promptly ready disgust theirhesitating reluctance with regard to everything strange their horror ofthe bad taste even of lively curiosity and in general the averseness ofevery distinguished and self-sufficing culture to avow a new desirea dissatisfaction with its own condition or an admiration of what isstrange: all this determines and disposes them unfavourably even towardsthe best things of the world which are not their property or could notbecome their prey--and no faculty is more unintelligible to such menthan just this historical sense with its truckling plebeiancuriosity. The case is not different with Shakespeare that marvelousSpanish-Moorish-Saxon synthesis of taste over whom an ancient Athenianof the circle of AEschylus would have half-killed himself with laughteror irritation: but we--accept precisely this wild motleyness thismedley of the most delicate the most coarse and the most artificialwith a secret confidence and cordiality; we enjoy it as a refinementof art reserved expressly for us and allow ourselves to be as littledisturbed by the repulsive fumes and the proximity of the Englishpopulace in which Shakespeares art and taste lives as perhaps onthe Chiaja of Naples where with all our senses awake we go our wayenchanted and voluntarily in spite of the drain-odour of the lowerquarters of the town. That as men of the historical sense we haveour virtues is not to be disputed:--we are unpretentious unselfishmodest brave habituated to self-control and self-renunciation verygrateful very patient very complaisant--but with all this we areperhaps not very tasteful. Let us finally confess it that what ismost difficult for us men of the historical sense to grasp feeltaste and love what finds us fundamentally prejudiced and almosthostile is precisely the perfection and ultimate maturity in everyculture and art the essentially noble in works and men their momentof smooth sea and halcyon self-sufficiency the goldenness and coldnesswhich all things show that have perfected themselves. Perhaps our greatvirtue of the historical sense is in necessary contrast to GOOD tasteat least to the very bad taste; and we can only evoke in ourselvesimperfectly hesitatingly and with compulsion the small short andhappy godsends and glorifications of human life as they shine here andthere: those moments and marvelous experiences when a great power hasvoluntarily come to a halt before the boundless and infinite--when asuper-abundance of refined delight has been enjoyed by a sudden checkingand petrifying by standing firmly and planting oneself fixedly on stilltrembling ground. PROPORTIONATENESS is strange to us let us confess itto ourselves; our itching is really the itching for the infinite theimmeasurable. Like the rider on his forward panting horse we let thereins fall before the infinite we modern men we semi-barbarians--andare only in OUR highest bliss when we--ARE IN MOST DANGER.. Whether it be hedonism pessimism utilitarianism or eudaemonismall those modes of thinking which measure the worth of things accordingto PLEASURE and PAIN that is according to accompanying circumstancesand secondary considerations are plausible modes of thought andnaivetes which every one conscious of CREATIVE powers and an artistsconscience will look down upon with scorn though not without sympathy.Sympathy for you!--to be sure that is not sympathy as you understandit: it is not sympathy for social distress for society with itssick and misfortuned for the hereditarily vicious and defective who lieon the ground around us; still less is it sympathy for the grumblingvexed revolutionary slave-classes who strive after power--they call itfreedom. OUR sympathy is a loftier and further-sighted sympathy:--wesee how MAN dwarfs himself how YOU dwarf him! and there are momentswhen we view YOUR sympathy with an indescribable anguish when we resistit--when we regard your seriousness as more dangerous than any kindof levity. You want if possible--and there is not a more foolish ifpossible--TO DO AWAY WITH SUFFERING; and we--it really seems that WEwould rather have it increased and made worse than it has ever been!Well-being as you understand it--is certainly not a goal; it seemsto us an END; a condition which at once renders man ludicrous andcontemptible--and makes his destruction DESIRABLE! The disciplineof suffering of GREAT suffering--know ye not that it is only THISdiscipline that has produced all the elevations of humanity hithertoThe tension of soul in misfortune which communicates to it its energyits shuddering in view of rack and ruin its inventiveness and braveryin undergoing enduring interpreting and exploiting misfortune andwhatever depth mystery disguise spirit artifice or greatness hasbeen bestowed upon the soul--has it not been bestowed through sufferingthrough the discipline of great suffering In man CREATURE and CREATORare united: in man there is not only matter shred excess clay mirefolly chaos; but there is also the creator the sculptor the hardnessof the hammer the divinity of the spectator and the seventh day--doye understand this contrast And that YOUR sympathy for the creaturein man applies to that which has to be fashioned bruised forgedstretched roasted annealed refined--to that which must necessarilySUFFER and IS MEANT to suffer And our sympathy--do ye not understandwhat our REVERSE sympathy applies to when it resists your sympathy asthe worst of all pampering and enervation--So it is sympathy AGAINSTsympathy!--But to repeat it once more there are higher problems thanthe problems of pleasure and pain and sympathy; and all systems ofphilosophy which deal only with these are naivetes.. WE IMMORALISTS.--This world with which WE are concerned in whichwe have to fear and love this almost invisible inaudible world ofdelicate command and delicate obedience a world of almost in everyrespect captious insidious sharp and tender--yes it is wellprotected from clumsy spectators and familiar curiosity! We arewoven into a strong net and garment of duties and CANNOT disengageourselves--precisely here we are men of duty even we! Occasionallyit is true we dance in our chains and betwixt our swords; itis none the less true that more often we gnash our teeth under thecircumstances and are impatient at the secret hardship of our lot. Butdo what we will fools and appearances say of us: These are men WITHOUTduty--we have always fools and appearances against us!. Honesty granting that it is the virtue of which we cannot ridourselves we free spirits--well we will labour at it with all ourperversity and love and not tire of perfecting ourselves in OURvirtue which alone remains: may its glance some day overspread likea gilded blue mocking twilight this aging civilization with its dullgloomy seriousness! And if nevertheless our honesty should one daygrow weary and sigh and stretch its limbs and find us too hard andwould fain have it pleasanter easier and gentler like an agreeablevice let us remain HARD we latest Stoics and let us send to itshelp whatever devilry we have in us:--our disgust at the clumsyand undefined our NITIMUR IN VETITUM our love of adventureour sharpened and fastidious curiosity our most subtle disguisedintellectual Will to Power and universal conquest which rambles androves avidiously around all the realms of the future--let us go with allour devils to the help of our God! It is probable that people willmisunderstand and mistake us on that account: what does it matter! Theywill say: Their honesty--that is their devilry and nothing else!What does it matter! And even if they were right--have not all Godshitherto been such sanctified re-baptized devils And after all whatdo we know of ourselves And what the spirit that leads us wants TO BECALLED It is a question of names. And how many spirits we harbourOur honesty we free spirits--let us be careful lest it become ourvanity our ornament and ostentation our limitation our stupidity!Every virtue inclines to stupidity every stupidity to virtue; stupidto the point of sanctity they say in Russia--let us be careful lestout of pure honesty we eventually become saints and bores! Is not lifea hundred times too short for us--to bore ourselves One would have tobelieve in eternal life in order to.... I hope to be forgiven for discovering that all moral philosophyhitherto has been tedious and has belonged to the soporificappliances--and that virtue in my opinion has been MORE injuredby the TEDIOUSNESS of its advocates than by anything else; at the sametime however I would not wish to overlook their general usefulness. Itis desirable that as few people as possible should reflect upon moralsand consequently it is very desirable that morals should not some daybecome interesting! But let us not be afraid! Things still remain todayas they have always been: I see no one in Europe who has or DISCLOSESan idea of the fact that philosophizing concerning morals might beconducted in a dangerous captious and ensnaring manner--that CALAMITYmight be involved therein. Observe for example the indefatigableinevitable English utilitarians: how ponderously and respectably theystalk on stalk along a Homeric metaphor expresses it better in thefootsteps of Bentham just as he had already stalked in the footsteps ofthe respectable Helvetius! no he was not a dangerous man HelvetiusCE SENATEUR POCOCURANTE to use an expression of Galiani. No newthought nothing of the nature of a finer turning or better expressionof an old thought not even a proper history of what has been previouslythought on the subject: an IMPOSSIBLE literature taking it all in allunless one knows how to leaven it with some mischief. In effect theold English vice called CANT which is MORAL TARTUFFISM has insinuateditself also into these moralists whom one must certainly read with aneye to their motives if one MUST read them concealed this time underthe new form of the scientific spirit; moreover there is not absentfrom them a secret struggle with the pangs of conscience from which arace of former Puritans must naturally suffer in all their scientifictinkering with morals. Is not a moralist the opposite of a PuritanThat is to say as a thinker who regards morality as questionableas worthy of interrogation in short as a problem Is moralizingnot-immoral In the end they all want English morality to berecognized as authoritative inasmuch as mankind or the generalutility or the happiness of the greatest number--no! the happinessof ENGLAND will be best served thereby. They would like by all meansto convince themselves that the striving after English happiness Imean after COMFORT and FASHION and in the highest instance a seat inParliament is at the same time the true path of virtue; in fact thatin so far as there has been virtue in the world hitherto it hasjust consisted in such striving. Not one of those ponderousconscience-stricken herding-animals who undertake to advocate thecause of egoism as conducive to the general welfare wants to haveany knowledge or inkling of the facts that the general welfare isno ideal no goal no notion that can be at all grasped but is only anostrum--that what is fair to one MAY NOT at all be fair to anotherthat the requirement of one morality for all is really a detriment tohigher men in short that there is a DISTINCTION OF RANK between manand man and consequently between morality and morality. They are anunassuming and fundamentally mediocre species of men these utilitarianEnglishmen and as already remarked in so far as they are tedious onecannot think highly enough of their utility. One ought even to ENCOURAGEthem as has been partially attempted in the following rhymes:--    Hail ye worthies barrow-wheeling    Longer--better aye revealing    Stiffer aye in head and knee;    Unenraptured never jesting    Mediocre everlasting    SANS GENIE ET SANS ESPRIT!. In these later ages which may be proud of their humanity therestill remains so much fear so much SUPERSTITION of the fear of thecruel wild beast the mastering of which constitutes the very pride ofthese humaner ages--that even obvious truths as if by the agreementof centuries have long remained unuttered because they have theappearance of helping the finally slain wild beast back to life again.I perhaps risk something when I allow such a truth to escape; letothers capture it again and give it so much milk of pious sentimentFOOTNOTE: An expression from Schillers William Tell Act IV Scene. to drink that it will lie down quiet and forgotten in its oldcorner.--One ought to learn anew about cruelty and open ones eyes;one ought at last to learn impatience in order that such immodestgross errors--as for instance have been fostered by ancient andmodern philosophers with regard to tragedy--may no longer wander aboutvirtuously and boldly. Almost everything that we call higher cultureis based upon the spiritualising and intensifying of CRUELTY--this ismy thesis; the wild beast has not been slain at all it lives itflourishes it has only been--transfigured. That which constitutes thepainful delight of tragedy is cruelty; that which operates agreeably inso-called tragic sympathy and at the basis even of everything sublimeup to the highest and most delicate thrills of metaphysics obtains itssweetness solely from the intermingled ingredient of cruelty. What theRoman enjoys in the arena the Christian in the ecstasies of the crossthe Spaniard at the sight of the faggot and stake or of the bull-fightthe present-day Japanese who presses his way to the tragedy the workmanof the Parisian suburbs who has a homesickness for bloody revolutionsthe Wagnerienne who with unhinged will undergoes the performance ofTristan and Isolde--what all these enjoy and strive with mysteriousardour to drink in is the philtre of the great Circe cruelty. Hereto be sure we must put aside entirely the blundering psychology offormer times which could only teach with regard to cruelty thatit originated at the sight of the suffering of OTHERS: there is anabundant super-abundant enjoyment even in ones own suffering incausing ones own suffering--and wherever man has allowed himself to bepersuaded to self-denial in the RELIGIOUS sense or to self-mutilationas among the Phoenicians and ascetics or in general todesensualisation decarnalisation and contrition to Puritanicalrepentance-spasms to vivisection of conscience and to Pascal-likeSACRIFIZIA DELL INTELLETO he is secretly allured and impelledforwards by his cruelty by the dangerous thrill of cruelty TOWARDSHIMSELF.--Finally let us consider that even the seeker of knowledgeoperates as an artist and glorifier of cruelty in that he compels hisspirit to perceive AGAINST its own inclination and often enough againstthe wishes of his heart:--he forces it to say Nay where he would liketo affirm love and adore; indeed every instance of taking a thingprofoundly and fundamentally is a violation an intentional injuringof the fundamental will of the spirit which instinctively aims atappearance and superficiality--even in every desire for knowledge thereis a drop of cruelty.. Perhaps what I have said here about a fundamental will of thespirit may not be understood without further details; I may be alloweda word of explanation.--That imperious something which is popularlycalled the spirit wishes to be master internally and externallyand to feel itself master; it has the will of a multiplicity for asimplicity a binding taming imperious and essentially ruling will.Its requirements and capacities here are the same as those assigned byphysiologists to everything that lives grows and multiplies. The powerof the spirit to appropriate foreign elements reveals itself in a strongtendency to assimilate the new to the old to simplify the manifoldto overlook or repudiate the absolutely contradictory; just as itarbitrarily re-underlines makes prominent and falsifies for itselfcertain traits and lines in the foreign elements in every portion ofthe outside world. Its object thereby is the incorporation of newexperiences the assortment of new things in the old arrangements--inshort growth; or more properly the FEELING of growth the feeling ofincreased power--is its object. This same will has at its service anapparently opposed impulse of the spirit a suddenly adopted preferenceof ignorance of arbitrary shutting out a closing of windows an innerdenial of this or that a prohibition to approach a sort of defensiveattitude against much that is knowable a contentment with obscuritywith the shutting-in horizon an acceptance and approval of ignorance:as that which is all necessary according to the degree of itsappropriating power its digestive power to speak figuratively andin fact the spirit resembles a stomach more than anything else. Herealso belong an occasional propensity of the spirit to let itself bedeceived perhaps with a waggish suspicion that it is NOT so and sobut is only allowed to pass as such a delight in uncertainty andambiguity an exulting enjoyment of arbitrary out-of-the-way narrownessand mystery of the too-near of the foreground of the magnifiedthe diminished the misshapen the beautified--an enjoyment of thearbitrariness of all these manifestations of power. Finally in thisconnection there is the not unscrupulous readiness of the spirit todeceive other spirits and dissemble before them--the constant pressingand straining of a creating shaping changeable power: the spiritenjoys therein its craftiness and its variety of disguises it enjoysalso its feeling of security therein--it is precisely by its Proteanarts that it is best protected and concealed!--COUNTER TO thispropensity for appearance for simplification for a disguise for acloak in short for an outside--for every outside is a cloak--thereoperates the sublime tendency of the man of knowledge which takes andINSISTS on taking things profoundly variously and thoroughly; as akind of cruelty of the intellectual conscience and taste which everycourageous thinker will acknowledge in himself provided as it oughtto be that he has sharpened and hardened his eye sufficiently long forintrospection and is accustomed to severe discipline and even severewords. He will say: There is something cruel in the tendency of myspirit: let the virtuous and amiable try to convince him that it is notso! In fact it would sound nicer if instead of our cruelty perhapsour extravagant honesty were talked about whispered about andglorified--we free VERY free spirits--and some day perhaps SUCH willactually be our--posthumous glory! Meanwhile--for there is plenty oftime until then--we should be least inclined to deck ourselves out insuch florid and fringed moral verbiage; our whole former work hasjust made us sick of this taste and its sprightly exuberance. They arebeautiful glistening jingling festive words: honesty love of truthlove of wisdom sacrifice for knowledge heroism of the truthful--thereis something in them that makes ones heart swell with pride. But weanchorites and marmots have long ago persuaded ourselves in all thesecrecy of an anchorites conscience that this worthy parade ofverbiage also belongs to the old false adornment frippery andgold-dust of unconscious human vanity and that even under suchflattering colour and repainting the terrible original text HOMO NATURAmust again be recognized. In effect to translate man back again intonature; to master the many vain and visionary interpretations andsubordinate meanings which have hitherto been scratched and daubed overthe eternal original text HOMO NATURA; to bring it about that man shallhenceforth stand before man as he now hardened by the disciplineof science stands before the OTHER forms of nature with fearlessOedipus-eyes and stopped Ulysses-ears deaf to the enticements of oldmetaphysical bird-catchers who have piped to him far too long: Thouart more! thou art higher! thou hast a different origin!--this may bea strange and foolish task but that it is a TASK who can deny! Why didwe choose it this foolish task Or to put the question differently:Why knowledge at all Every one will ask us about this. And thuspressed we who have asked ourselves the question a hundred times havenot found and cannot find any better answer..... Learning alters us it does what all nourishment does that does notmerely conserve--as the physiologist knows. But at the bottom of oursouls quite down below there is certainly something unteachablea granite of spiritual fate of predetermined decision and answer topredetermined chosen questions. In each cardinal problem there speaksan unchangeable I am this; a thinker cannot learn anew about man andwoman for instance but can only learn fully--he can only follow to theend what is fixed about them in himself. Occasionally we find certainsolutions of problems which make strong beliefs for us; perhaps theyare henceforth called convictions. Later on--one sees in them onlyfootsteps to self-knowledge guide-posts to the problem which weourselves ARE--or more correctly to the great stupidity which we embodyour spiritual fate the UNTEACHABLE in us quite down below.--In viewof this liberal compliment which I have just paid myself permissionwill perhaps be more readily allowed me to utter some truths aboutwoman as she is provided that it is known at the outset how literallythey are merely--MY truths.. Woman wishes to be independent and therefore she begins toenlighten men about woman as she is--THIS is one of the worstdevelopments of the general UGLIFYING of Europe. For what must theseclumsy attempts of feminine scientificality and self-exposure bringto light! Woman has so much cause for shame; in woman there is somuch pedantry superficiality schoolmasterliness petty presumptionunbridledness and indiscretion concealed--study only womans behaviourtowards children!--which has really been best restrained and dominatedhitherto by the FEAR of man. Alas if ever the eternally tedious inwoman--she has plenty of it!--is allowed to venture forth! if shebegins radically and on principle to unlearn her wisdom and art-ofcharming of playing of frightening away sorrow of alleviating andtaking easily; if she forgets her delicate aptitude for agreeabledesires! Female voices are already raised which by Saint Aristophanes!make one afraid:--with medical explicitness it is stated in athreatening manner what woman first and last REQUIRES from man. Isit not in the very worst taste that woman thus sets herself up to bescientific Enlightenment hitherto has fortunately been mens affairmens gift--we remained therewith among ourselves; and in the endin view of all that women write about woman we may well haveconsiderable doubt as to whether woman really DESIRES enlightenmentabout herself--and CAN desire it. If woman does not thereby seek a newORNAMENT for herself--I believe ornamentation belongs to the eternallyfeminine--why then she wishes to make herself feared: perhaps shethereby wishes to get the mastery. But she does not want truth--whatdoes woman care for truth From the very first nothing is more foreignmore repugnant or more hostile to woman than truth--her great art isfalsehood her chief concern is appearance and beauty. Let us confessit we men: we honour and love this very art and this very instinct inwoman: we who have the hard task and for our recreation gladly seek thecompany of beings under whose hands glances and delicate follies ourseriousness our gravity and profundity appear almost like follies tous. Finally I ask the question: Did a woman herself ever acknowledgeprofundity in a womans mind or justice in a womans heart And is itnot true that on the whole woman has hitherto been most despised bywoman herself and not at all by us--We men desire that woman shouldnot continue to compromise herself by enlightening us; just as it wasmans care and the consideration for woman when the church decreed:mulier taceat in ecclesia. It was to the benefit of woman when Napoleongave the too eloquent Madame de Stael to understand: mulier taceat inpoliticis!--and in my opinion he is a true friend of woman who callsout to women today: mulier taceat de mulierel.. It betrays corruption of the instincts--apart from the fact thatit betrays bad taste--when a woman refers to Madame Roland or Madame deStael or Monsieur George Sand as though something were proved therebyin favour of woman as she is. Among men these are the three comicalwomen as they are--nothing more!--and just the best involuntarycounter-arguments against feminine emancipation and autonomy.. Stupidity in the kitchen; woman as cook; the terriblethoughtlessness with which the feeding of the family and the master ofthe house is managed! Woman does not understand what food means and sheinsists on being cook! If woman had been a thinking creature she shouldcertainly as cook for thousands of years have discovered the mostimportant physiological facts and should likewise have got possessionof the healing art! Through bad female cooks--through the entire lackof reason in the kitchen--the development of mankind has been longestretarded and most interfered with: even today matters are very littlebetter. A word to High School girls.. There are turns and casts of fancy there are sentences littlehandfuls of words in which a whole culture a whole society suddenlycrystallises itself. Among these is the incidental remark of Madame deLambert to her son: MON AMI NE VOUS PERMETTEZ JAMAIS QUE DES FOLIESQUI VOUS FERONT GRAND PLAISIR--the motherliest and wisest remark bythe way that was ever addressed to a son.. I have no doubt that every noble woman will oppose what Dante andGoethe believed about woman--the former when he sang ELLA GUARDAVASUSO ED IO IN LEI and the latter when he interpreted it theeternally feminine draws us ALOFT; for THIS is just what she believesof the eternally masculine..SEVEN APOPHTHEGMS FOR WOMENHow the longest ennui flees When a man comes to our knees!Age alas! and science staid Furnish even weak virtue aid.Sombre garb and silence meet: Dress for every dame--discreet.Whom I thank when in my bliss God!--and my good tailoress!Young a flower-decked cavern home; Old a dragon thence doth roam.Noble title leg thats fine Man as well: Oh were HE mine!Speech in brief and sense in mass--Slippery for the jenny-ass!A. Woman has hitherto been treated by men like birds which losingtheir way have come down among them from an elevation: as somethingdelicate fragile wild strange sweet and animating--but as somethingalso which must be cooped up to prevent it flying away.. To be mistaken in the fundamental problem of man and woman todeny here the profoundest antagonism and the necessity for an eternallyhostile tension to dream here perhaps of equal rights equaltraining equal claims and obligations: that is a TYPICAL sign ofshallow-mindedness; and a thinker who has proved himself shallow atthis dangerous spot--shallow in instinct!--may generally be regarded assuspicious nay more as betrayed as discovered; he will probably provetoo short for all fundamental questions of life future as well aspresent and will be unable to descend into ANY of the depths. On theother hand a man who has depth of spirit as well as of desires andhas also the depth of benevolence which is capable of severity andharshness and easily confounded with them can only think of woman asORIENTALS do: he must conceive of her as a possession as confinableproperty as a being predestined for service and accomplishing hermission therein--he must take his stand in this matter upon the immenserationality of Asia upon the superiority of the instinct of Asia asthe Greeks did formerly; those best heirs and scholars of Asia--whoas is well known with their INCREASING culture and amplitude of powerfrom Homer to the time of Pericles became gradually STRICTER towardswoman in short more Oriental. HOW necessary HOW logical even HOWhumanely desirable this was let us consider for ourselves!. The weaker sex has in no previous age been treated with somuch respect by men as at present--this belongs to the tendency andfundamental taste of democracy in the same way as disrespectfulness toold age--what wonder is it that abuse should be immediately made ofthis respect They want more they learn to make claims the tributeof respect is at last felt to be well-nigh galling; rivalry for rightsindeed actual strife itself would be preferred: in a word woman islosing modesty. And let us immediately add that she is also losingtaste. She is unlearning to FEAR man: but the woman who unlearns tofear sacrifices her most womanly instincts. That woman should ventureforward when the fear-inspiring quality in man--or more definitelythe MAN in man--is no longer either desired or fully developed isreasonable enough and also intelligible enough; what is more difficultto understand is that precisely thereby--woman deteriorates. This iswhat is happening nowadays: let us not deceive ourselves about it!Wherever the industrial spirit has triumphed over the militaryand aristocratic spirit woman strives for the economic and legalindependence of a clerk: woman as clerkess is inscribed on the portalof the modern society which is in course of formation. While shethus appropriates new rights aspires to be master and inscribesprogress of woman on her flags and banners the very opposite realisesitself with terrible obviousness: WOMAN RETROGRADES. Since the FrenchRevolution the influence of woman in Europe has DECLINED in proportionas she has increased her rights and claims; and the emancipation ofwoman insofar as it is desired and demanded by women themselves andnot only by masculine shallow-pates thus proves to be a remarkablesymptom of the increased weakening and deadening of the most womanlyinstincts. There is STUPIDITY in this movement an almost masculinestupidity of which a well-reared woman--who is always a sensiblewoman--might be heartily ashamed. To lose the intuition as to the groundupon which she can most surely achieve victory; to neglect exercise inthe use of her proper weapons; to let-herself-go before man perhapseven to the book where formerly she kept herself in control and inrefined artful humility; to neutralize with her virtuous audacity mansfaith in a VEILED fundamentally different ideal in woman somethingeternally necessarily feminine; to emphatically and loquaciouslydissuade man from the idea that woman must be preserved cared forprotected and indulged like some delicate strangely wild andoften pleasant domestic animal; the clumsy and indignant collection ofeverything of the nature of servitude and bondage which the position ofwoman in the hitherto existing order of society has entailed and stillentails as though slavery were a counter-argument and not rather acondition of every higher culture of every elevation of culture:--whatdoes all this betoken if not a disintegration of womanly instinctsa defeminising Certainly there are enough of idiotic friends andcorrupters of woman among the learned asses of the masculine sex whoadvise woman to defeminize herself in this manner and to imitateall the stupidities from which man in Europe European manlinesssuffers--who would like to lower woman to general culture indeedeven to newspaper reading and meddling with politics. Here and therethey wish even to make women into free spirits and literary workers: asthough a woman without piety would not be something perfectly obnoxiousor ludicrous to a profound and godless man;--almost everywhere hernerves are being ruined by the most morbid and dangerous kind of musicour latest German music and she is daily being made more hystericaland more incapable of fulfilling her first and last function that ofbearing robust children. They wish to cultivate her in general stillmore and intend as they say to make the weaker sex STRONG byculture: as if history did not teach in the most emphatic manner thatthe cultivating of mankind and his weakening--that is to say theweakening dissipating and languishing of his FORCE OF WILL--havealways kept pace with one another and that the most powerful andinfluential women in the world and lastly the mother of Napoleonhad just to thank their force of will--and not their schoolmasters--fortheir power and ascendancy over men. That which inspires respectin woman and often enough fear also is her NATURE which is morenatural than that of man her genuine carnivora-like cunningflexibility her tiger-claws beneath the glove her NAIVETE in egoismher untrainableness and innate wildness the incomprehensiblenessextent and deviation of her desires and virtues. That which in spiteof fear excites ones sympathy for the dangerous and beautiful catwoman is that she seems more afflicted more vulnerable morenecessitous of love and more condemned to disillusionment than anyother creature. Fear and sympathy it is with these feelings that man hashitherto stood in the presence of woman always with one foot already intragedy which rends while it delights--What And all that is now tobe at an end And the DISENCHANTMENT of woman is in progress Thetediousness of woman is slowly evolving Oh Europe! Europe! We knowthe horned animal which was always most attractive to thee from whichdanger is ever again threatening thee! Thy old fable might once morebecome history--an immense stupidity might once again overmasterthee and carry thee away! And no God concealed beneath it--no! only anidea a modern idea!CHAPTER VIII. PEOPLES AND COUNTRIES. I HEARD once again for the first time Richard Wagners overtureto the Mastersinger: it is a piece of magnificent gorgeous heavylatter-day art which has the pride to presuppose two centuries of musicas still living in order that it may be understood:--it is an honourto Germans that such a pride did not miscalculate! What flavoursand forces what seasons and climes do we not find mingled in it! Itimpresses us at one time as ancient at another time as foreign bitterand too modern it is as arbitrary as it is pompously traditional itis not infrequently roguish still oftener rough and coarse--it has fireand courage and at the same time the loose dun-coloured skin of fruitswhich ripen too late. It flows broad and full: and suddenly there is amoment of inexplicable hesitation like a gap that opens between causeand effect an oppression that makes us dream almost a nightmare; butalready it broadens and widens anew the old stream of delight--the mostmanifold delight--of old and new happiness; including ESPECIALLYthe joy of the artist in himself which he refuses to conceal hisastonished happy cognizance of his mastery of the expedients hereemployed the new newly acquired imperfectly tested expedients of artwhich he apparently betrays to us. All in all however no beauty noSouth nothing of the delicate southern clearness of the sky nothingof grace no dance hardly a will to logic; a certain clumsiness evenwhich is also emphasized as though the artist wished to say to us: Itis part of my intention; a cumbersome drapery something arbitrarilybarbaric and ceremonious a flirring of learned and venerable conceitsand witticisms; something German in the best and worst sense ofthe word something in the German style manifold formless andinexhaustible; a certain German potency and super-plenitude ofsoul which is not afraid to hide itself under the RAFFINEMENTS ofdecadence--which perhaps feels itself most at ease there; a realgenuine token of the German soul which is at the same time young andaged too ripe and yet still too rich in futurity. This kind of musicexpresses best what I think of the Germans: they belong to the daybefore yesterday and the day after tomorrow--THEY HAVE AS YET NO TODAY.. We good Europeans we also have hours when we allow ourselves awarm-hearted patriotism a plunge and relapse into old loves and narrowviews--I have just given an example of it--hours of national excitementof patriotic anguish and all other sorts of old-fashioned floods ofsentiment. Duller spirits may perhaps only get done with what confinesits operations in us to hours and plays itself out in hours--in aconsiderable time: some in half a year others in half a lifetimeaccording to the speed and strength with which they digest and changetheir material. Indeed I could think of sluggish hesitating raceswhich even in our rapidly moving Europe would require half a centuryere they could surmount such atavistic attacks of patriotism andsoil-attachment and return once more to reason that is to say togood Europeanism. And while digressing on this possibility Ihappen to become an ear-witness of a conversation between two oldpatriots--they were evidently both hard of hearing and consequentlyspoke all the louder. HE has as much and knows as much philosophy asa peasant or a corps-student said the one--he is still innocent. Butwhat does that matter nowadays! It is the age of the masses: they lie ontheir belly before everything that is massive. And so also in politicis.A statesman who rears up for them a new Tower of Babel some monstrosityof empire and power they call great--what does it matter that we moreprudent and conservative ones do not meanwhile give up the old beliefthat it is only the great thought that gives greatness to an action oraffair. Supposing a statesman were to bring his people into the positionof being obliged henceforth to practise high politics for which theywere by nature badly endowed and prepared so that they would haveto sacrifice their old and reliable virtues out of love to a new anddoubtful mediocrity;--supposing a statesman were to condemn his peoplegenerally to practise politics when they have hitherto had somethingbetter to do and think about and when in the depths of their soulsthey have been unable to free themselves from a prudent loathing ofthe restlessness emptiness and noisy wranglings of the essentiallypolitics-practising nations;--supposing such a statesman were tostimulate the slumbering passions and avidities of his people were tomake a stigma out of their former diffidence and delight in aloofnessan offence out of their exoticism and hidden permanency were todepreciate their most radical proclivities subvert their consciencesmake their minds narrow and their tastes national--what! a statesmanwho should do all this which his people would have to do penance forthroughout their whole future if they had a future such a statesmanwould be GREAT would he--Undoubtedly! replied the other old patriotvehemently otherwise he COULD NOT have done it! It was mad perhaps towish such a thing! But perhaps everything great has been just as madat its commencement!--Misuse of words! cried his interlocutorcontradictorily--strong! strong! Strong and mad! NOT great!--The oldmen had obviously become heated as they thus shouted their truths ineach others faces but I in my happiness and apartness considered howsoon a stronger one may become master of the strong and also thatthere is a compensation for the intellectual superficialising of anation--namely in the deepening of another.. Whether we call it civilization or humanising or progresswhich now distinguishes the European whether we call it simply withoutpraise or blame by the political formula the DEMOCRATIC movement inEurope--behind all the moral and political foregrounds pointed to bysuch formulas an immense PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESS goes on which is everextending the process of the assimilation of Europeans theirincreasing detachment from the conditions under which climatically andhereditarily united races originate their increasing independence ofevery definite milieu that for centuries would fain inscribe itselfwith equal demands on soul and body--that is to say the slow emergenceof an essentially SUPER-NATIONAL and nomadic species of man whopossesses physiologically speaking a maximum of the art and powerof adaptation as his typical distinction. This process of the EVOLVINGEUROPEAN which can be retarded in its TEMPO by great relapses butwill perhaps just gain and grow thereby in vehemence and depth--thestill-raging storm and stress of national sentiment pertains to itand also the anarchism which is appearing at present--this processwill probably arrive at results on which its naive propagators andpanegyrists the apostles of modern ideas would least care to reckon.The same new conditions under which on an average a levelling andmediocrising of man will take place--a useful industrious variouslyserviceable and clever gregarious man--are in the highest degreesuitable to give rise to exceptional men of the most dangerous andattractive qualities. For while the capacity for adaptation which isevery day trying changing conditions and begins a new work with everygeneration almost with every decade makes the POWERFULNESS of the typeimpossible; while the collective impression of such future Europeanswill probably be that of numerous talkative weak-willed and veryhandy workmen who REQUIRE a master a commander as they require theirdaily bread; while therefore the democratising of Europe will tend tothe production of a type prepared for SLAVERY in the most subtlesense of the term: the STRONG man will necessarily in individual andexceptional cases become stronger and richer than he has perhaps everbeen before--owing to the unprejudicedness of his schooling owing tothe immense variety of practice art and disguise. I meant to saythat the democratising of Europe is at the same time an involuntaryarrangement for the rearing of TYRANTS--taking the word in all itsmeanings even in its most spiritual sense.. I hear with pleasure that our sun is moving rapidly towards theconstellation Hercules: and I hope that the men on this earth will dolike the sun. And we foremost we good Europeans!. There was a time when it was customary to call Germans deepby way of distinction; but now that the most successful type of newGermanism is covetous of quite other honours and perhaps missessmartness in all that has depth it is almost opportune and patrioticto doubt whether we did not formerly deceive ourselves with thatcommendation: in short whether German depth is not at bottom somethingdifferent and worse--and something from which thank God we are on thepoint of successfully ridding ourselves. Let us try then to relearnwith regard to German depth; the only thing necessary for the purpose isa little vivisection of the German soul.--The German soul is above allmanifold varied in its source aggregated and super-imposed ratherthan actually built: this is owing to its origin. A German who wouldembolden himself to assert: Two souls alas dwell in my breast wouldmake a bad guess at the truth or more correctly he would come farshort of the truth about the number of souls. As a people made up ofthe most extraordinary mixing and mingling of races perhaps even with apreponderance of the pre-Aryan element as the people of the centre inevery sense of the term the Germans are more intangible more amplemore contradictory more unknown more incalculable more surprisingand even more terrifying than other peoples are to themselves:--theyescape DEFINITION and are thereby alone the despair of the French. ItIS characteristic of the Germans that the question: What is Germannever dies out among them. Kotzebue certainly knew his Germans wellenough: We are known they cried jubilantly to him--but Sand alsothought he knew them. Jean Paul knew what he was doing when he declaredhimself incensed at Fichtes lying but patriotic flatteries andexaggerations--but it is probable that Goethe thought differently aboutGermans from Jean Paul even though he acknowledged him to be right withregard to Fichte. It is a question what Goethe really thought about theGermans--But about many things around him he never spoke explicitlyand all his life he knew how to keep an astute silence--probably hehad good reason for it. It is certain that it was not the Wars ofIndependence that made him look up more joyfully any more than it wasthe French Revolution--the event on account of which he RECONSTRUCTEDhis Faust and indeed the whole problem of man was the appearanceof Napoleon. There are words of Goethe in which he condemns withimpatient severity as from a foreign land that which Germans take apride in he once defined the famous German turn of mind as Indulgencetowards its own and others weaknesses. Was he wrong it ischaracteristic of Germans that one is seldom entirely wrong about them.The German soul has passages and galleries in it there are caveshiding-places and dungeons therein its disorder has much of the charmof the mysterious the German is well acquainted with the bypaths tochaos. And as everything loves its symbol so the German loves theclouds and all that is obscure evolving crepuscular damp andshrouded it seems to him that everything uncertain undevelopedself-displacing and growing is deep. The German himself does notEXIST he is BECOMING he is developing himself. Development istherefore the essentially German discovery and hit in the great domainof philosophical formulas--a ruling idea which together with Germanbeer and German music is labouring to Germanise all Europe. Foreignersare astonished and attracted by the riddles which the conflicting natureat the basis of the German soul propounds to them riddles whichHegel systematised and Richard Wagner has in the end set to music.Good-natured and spiteful--such a juxtaposition preposterous in thecase of every other people is unfortunately only too often justifiedin Germany one has only to live for a while among Swabians to know this!The clumsiness of the German scholar and his social distastefulnessagree alarmingly well with his physical rope-dancing and nimbleboldness of which all the Gods have learnt to be afraid. If any onewishes to see the German soul demonstrated ad oculos let himonly look at German taste at German arts and manners what boorishindifference to taste! How the noblest and the commonest stand therein juxtaposition! How disorderly and how rich is the whole constitutionof this soul! The German DRAGS at his soul he drags at everything heexperiences. He digests his events badly; he never gets donewith them; and German depth is often only a difficult hesitatingdigestion. And just as all chronic invalids all dyspeptics like whatis convenient so the German loves frankness and honesty; it isso CONVENIENT to be frank and honest!--This confidingness thiscomplaisance this showing-the-cards of German HONESTY is probably themost dangerous and most successful disguise which the German is up tonowadays: it is his proper Mephistophelean art; with this he can stillachieve much! The German lets himself go and thereby gazes withfaithful blue empty German eyes--and other countries immediatelyconfound him with his dressing-gown!--I meant to say that let Germandepth be what it will--among ourselves alone we perhaps take theliberty to laugh at it--we shall do well to continue henceforth tohonour its appearance and good name and not barter away too cheaply ourold reputation as a people of depth for Prussian smartness andBerlin wit and sand. It is wise for a people to pose and LET itselfbe regarded as profound clumsy good-natured honest and foolish: itmight even be--profound to do so! Finally we should do honour toour name--we are not called the TIUSCHE VOLK deceptive people fornothing..... The good old time is past it sang itself out in Mozart--howhappy are WE that his ROCOCO still speaks to us that his goodcompany his tender enthusiasm his childish delight in the Chinese andits flourishes his courtesy of heart his longing for the elegant theamorous the tripping the tearful and his belief in the South canstill appeal to SOMETHING LEFT in us! Ah some time or other it will beover with it!--but who can doubt that it will be over still sooner withthe intelligence and taste for Beethoven! For he was only the last echoof a break and transition in style and NOT like Mozart the last echoof a great European taste which had existed for centuries. Beethovenis the intermediate event between an old mellow soul that is constantlybreaking down and a future over-young soul that is always COMING;there is spread over his music the twilight of eternal loss and eternalextravagant hope--the same light in which Europe was bathed when itdreamed with Rousseau when it danced round the Tree of Liberty of theRevolution and finally almost fell down in adoration before Napoleon.But how rapidly does THIS very sentiment now pale how difficultnowadays is even the APPREHENSION of this sentiment how strangely doesthe language of Rousseau Schiller Shelley and Byron sound to our earin whom COLLECTIVELY the same fate of Europe was able to SPEAK whichknew how to SING in Beethoven!--Whatever German music came afterwardsbelongs to Romanticism that is to say to a movement whichhistorically considered was still shorter more fleeting and moresuperficial than that great interlude the transition of Europe fromRousseau to Napoleon and to the rise of democracy. Weber--but what doWE care nowadays for Freischutz and Oberon! Or Marschners HansHeiling and Vampyre! Or even Wagners Tannhauser! That is extinctalthough not yet forgotten music. This whole music of Romanticismbesides was not noble enough was not musical enough to maintain itsposition anywhere but in the theatre and before the masses; from thebeginning it was second-rate music which was little thought of bygenuine musicians. It was different with Felix Mendelssohn that halcyonmaster who on account of his lighter purer happier soul quicklyacquired admiration and was equally quickly forgotten: as the beautifulEPISODE of German music. But with regard to Robert Schumann who tookthings seriously and has been taken seriously from the first--hewas the last that founded a school--do we not now regard it as asatisfaction a relief a deliverance that this very Romanticismof Schumanns has been surmounted Schumann fleeing into the SaxonSwitzerland of his soul with a half Werther-like half Jean-Paul-likenature assuredly not like Beethoven! assuredly not like Byron!--hisMANFRED music is a mistake and a misunderstanding to the extent ofinjustice; Schumann with his taste which was fundamentally a PETTYtaste that is to say a dangerous propensity--doubly dangerous amongGermans--for quiet lyricism and intoxication of the feelings goingconstantly apart timidly withdrawing and retiring a noble weakling whorevelled in nothing but anonymous joy and sorrow from the beginninga sort of girl and NOLI ME TANGERE--this Schumann was already merely aGERMAN event in music and no longer a European event as Beethoven hadbeen as in a still greater degree Mozart had been; with Schumann Germanmusic was threatened with its greatest danger that of LOSING THE VOICEFOR THE SOUL OF EUROPE and sinking into a merely national affair.. What a torture are books written in German to a reader who has aTHIRD ear! How indignantly he stands beside the slowly turning swampof sounds without tune and rhythms without dance which Germans calla book! And even the German who READS books! How lazily howreluctantly how badly he reads! How many Germans know and consider itobligatory to know that there is ART in every good sentence--art whichmust be divined if the sentence is to be understood! If there is amisunderstanding about its TEMPO for instance the sentence itselfis misunderstood! That one must not be doubtful about therhythm-determining syllables that one should feel the breaking of thetoo-rigid symmetry as intentional and as a charm that one should lend afine and patient ear to every STACCATO and every RUBATO that one shoulddivine the sense in the sequence of the vowels and diphthongs and howdelicately and richly they can be tinted and retinted in the order oftheir arrangement--who among book-reading Germans is complaisant enoughto recognize such duties and requirements and to listen to so much artand intention in language After all one just has no ear for it;and so the most marked contrasts of style are not heard and the mostdelicate artistry is as it were SQUANDERED on the deaf.--These were mythoughts when I noticed how clumsily and unintuitively two masters inthe art of prose-writing have been confounded: one whose words dropdown hesitatingly and coldly as from the roof of a damp cave--he countson their dull sound and echo; and another who manipulates his languagelike a flexible sword and from his arm down into his toes feels thedangerous bliss of the quivering over-sharp blade which wishes tobite hiss and cut.. How little the German style has to do with harmony and with theear is shown by the fact that precisely our good musicians themselveswrite badly. The German does not read aloud he does not read for theear but only with his eyes; he has put his ears away in the drawer forthe time. In antiquity when a man read--which was seldom enough--he readsomething to himself and in a loud voice; they were surprised whenany one read silently and sought secretly the reason of it. In aloud voice: that is to say with all the swellings inflections andvariations of key and changes of TEMPO in which the ancient PUBLICworld took delight. The laws of the written style were then the sameas those of the spoken style; and these laws depended partly on thesurprising development and refined requirements of the ear and larynx;partly on the strength endurance and power of the ancient lungs. Inthe ancient sense a period is above all a physiological whole inasmuchas it is comprised in one breath. Such periods as occur in Demosthenesand Cicero swelling twice and sinking twice and all in one breathwere pleasures to the men of ANTIQUITY who knew by their own schoolinghow to appreciate the virtue therein the rareness and the difficultyin the deliverance of such a period;--WE have really no right to theBIG period we modern men who are short of breath in every sense! Thoseancients indeed were all of them dilettanti in speaking consequentlyconnoisseurs consequently critics--they thus brought their orators tothe highest pitch; in the same manner as in the last century when allItalian ladies and gentlemen knew how to sing the virtuosoship of songand with it also the art of melody reached its elevation. In Germanyhowever until quite recently when a kind of platform eloquence beganshyly and awkwardly enough to flutter its young wings there wasproperly speaking only one kind of public and APPROXIMATELY artisticaldiscourse--that delivered from the pulpit. The preacher was the only onein Germany who knew the weight of a syllable or a word in what manner asentence strikes springs rushes flows and comes to a close; he alonehad a conscience in his ears often enough a bad conscience: for reasonsare not lacking why proficiency in oratory should be especially seldomattained by a German or almost always too late. The masterpiece ofGerman prose is therefore with good reason the masterpiece of itsgreatest preacher: the BIBLE has hitherto been the best Germanbook. Compared with Luthers Bible almost everything else is merelyliterature--something which has not grown in Germany and thereforehas not taken and does not take root in German hearts as the Bible hasdone.. There are two kinds of geniuses: one which above all engenders andseeks to engender and another which willingly lets itself be fructifiedand brings forth. And similarly among the gifted nations there arethose on whom the womans problem of pregnancy has devolved and thesecret task of forming maturing and perfecting--the Greeks forinstance were a nation of this kind and so are the French; and otherswhich have to fructify and become the cause of new modes of life--likethe Jews the Romans and in all modesty be it asked: like theGermans--nations tortured and enraptured by unknown fevers andirresistibly forced out of themselves amorous and longing forforeign races for such as let themselves be fructified and withalimperious like everything conscious of being full of generative forceand consequently empowered by the grace of God. These two kinds ofgeniuses seek each other like man and woman; but they also misunderstandeach other--like man and woman.. Every nation has its own Tartuffery and calls that itsvirtue.--One does not know--cannot know the best that is in one.. What Europe owes to the Jews--Many things good and bad and aboveall one thing of the nature both of the best and the worst: the grandstyle in morality the fearfulness and majesty of infinite demands ofinfinite significations the whole Romanticism and sublimity of moralquestionableness--and consequently just the most attractive ensnaringand exquisite element in those iridescences and allurements to lifein the aftersheen of which the sky of our European culture its eveningsky now glows--perhaps glows out. For this we artists among thespectators and philosophers are--grateful to the Jews.. It must be taken into the bargain if various clouds anddisturbances--in short slight attacks of stupidity--pass over thespirit of a people that suffers and WANTS to suffer from nationalnervous fever and political ambition: for instance among present-dayGermans there is alternately the anti-French folly the anti-Semiticfolly the anti-Polish folly the Christian-romantic folly theWagnerian folly the Teutonic folly the Prussian folly just look atthose poor historians the Sybels and Treitschkes and their closelybandaged heads and whatever else these little obscurations of theGerman spirit and conscience may be called. May it be forgiven me thatI too when on a short daring sojourn on very infected ground did notremain wholly exempt from the disease but like every one else beganto entertain thoughts about matters which did not concern me--the firstsymptom of political infection. About the Jews for instance listento the following:--I have never yet met a German who was favourablyinclined to the Jews; and however decided the repudiation of actualanti-Semitism may be on the part of all prudent and political men thisprudence and policy is not perhaps directed against the nature of thesentiment itself but only against its dangerous excess and especiallyagainst the distasteful and infamous expression of this excess ofsentiment;--on this point we must not deceive ourselves. That Germanyhas amply SUFFICIENT Jews that the German stomach the German bloodhas difficulty and will long have difficulty in disposing only of thisquantity of Jew--as the Italian the Frenchman and the Englishmanhave done by means of a stronger digestion:--that is the unmistakabledeclaration and language of a general instinct to which one must listenand according to which one must act. Let no more Jews come in! And shutthe doors especially towards the East also towards Austria!--thuscommands the instinct of a people whose nature is still feeble anduncertain so that it could be easily wiped out easily extinguished bya stronger race. The Jews however are beyond all doubt the strongesttoughest and purest race at present living in Europe they know howto succeed even under the worst conditions in fact better than underfavourable ones by means of virtues of some sort which one would likenowadays to label as vices--owing above all to a resolute faith whichdoes not need to be ashamed before modern ideas they alter onlyWHEN they do alter in the same way that the Russian Empire makesits conquest--as an empire that has plenty of time and is not ofyesterday--namely according to the principle as slowly as possible!A thinker who has the future of Europe at heart will in all hisperspectives concerning the future calculate upon the Jews as hewill calculate upon the Russians as above all the surest and likeliestfactors in the great play and battle of forces. That which is at presentcalled a nation in Europe and is really rather a RES FACTA than NATAindeed sometimes confusingly similar to a RES FICTA ET PICTA is inevery case something evolving young easily displaced and not yeta race much less such a race AERE PERENNUS as the Jews are suchnations should most carefully avoid all hot-headed rivalry andhostility! It is certain that the Jews if they desired--or if theywere driven to it as the anti-Semites seem to wish--COULD now have theascendancy nay literally the supremacy over Europe that they are NOTworking and planning for that end is equally certain. Meanwhile theyrather wish and desire even somewhat importunely to be insorbed andabsorbed by Europe they long to be finally settled authorized andrespected somewhere and wish to put an end to the nomadic life to thewandering Jew--and one should certainly take account of this impulseand tendency and MAKE ADVANCES to it it possibly betokens a mitigationof the Jewish instincts for which purpose it would perhaps be usefuland fair to banish the anti-Semitic bawlers out of the country. Oneshould make advances with all prudence and with selection pretty muchas the English nobility do It stands to reason that the more powerfuland strongly marked types of new Germanism could enter into relationwith the Jews with the least hesitation for instance the noblemanofficer from the Prussian border it would be interesting in many waysto see whether the genius for money and patience and especially someintellect and intellectuality--sadly lacking in the place referred tocould not in addition be annexed and trained to the hereditary art ofcommanding and obeying--for both of which the country in question hasnow a classic reputation But here it is expedient to break off my festaldiscourse and my sprightly Teutonomania for I have already reached mySERIOUS TOPIC the European problem as I understand it the rearingof a new ruling caste for Europe.. They are not a philosophical race--the English: Bacon represents anATTACK on the philosophical spirit generally Hobbes Hume and Lockean abasement and a depreciation of the idea of a philosopher for morethan a century. It was AGAINST Hume that Kant uprose and raised himself;it was Locke of whom Schelling RIGHTLY said JE MEPRISE LOCKE; in thestruggle against the English mechanical stultification of the worldHegel and Schopenhauer along with Goethe were of one accord; thetwo hostile brother-geniuses in philosophy who pushed in differentdirections towards the opposite poles of German thought and therebywronged each other as only brothers will do.--What is lacking inEngland and has always been lacking that half-actor and rhetoricianknew well enough the absurd muddle-head Carlyle who sought to concealunder passionate grimaces what he knew about himself: namely what wasLACKING in Carlyle--real POWER of intellect real DEPTH of intellectualperception in short philosophy. It is characteristic of such anunphilosophical race to hold on firmly to Christianity--they NEED itsdiscipline for moralizing and humanizing. The Englishman more gloomysensual headstrong and brutal than the German--is for that veryreason as the baser of the two also the most pious: he has all theMORE NEED of Christianity. To finer nostrils this English Christianityitself has still a characteristic English taint of spleen and alcoholicexcess for which owing to good reasons it is used as an antidote--thefiner poison to neutralize the coarser: a finer form of poisoning isin fact a step in advance with coarse-mannered people a step towardsspiritualization. The English coarseness and rustic demureness is stillmost satisfactorily disguised by Christian pantomime and by prayingand psalm-singing or more correctly it is thereby explained anddifferently expressed; and for the herd of drunkards and rakes whoformerly learned moral grunting under the influence of Methodism andmore recently as the Salvation Army a penitential fit may really bethe relatively highest manifestation of humanity to which they canbe elevated: so much may reasonably be admitted. That however whichoffends even in the humanest Englishman is his lack of music to speakfiguratively and also literally: he has neither rhythm nor dance inthe movements of his soul and body; indeed not even the desire forrhythm and dance for music. Listen to him speaking; look at the mostbeautiful Englishwoman WALKING--in no country on earth are there morebeautiful doves and swans; finally listen to them singing! But I asktoo much.... There are truths which are best recognized by mediocre mindsbecause they are best adapted for them there are truths which onlypossess charms and seductive power for mediocre spirits:--one is pushedto this probably unpleasant conclusion now that the influence ofrespectable but mediocre Englishmen--I may mention Darwin JohnStuart Mill and Herbert Spencer--begins to gain the ascendancy in themiddle-class region of European taste. Indeed who could doubt that itis a useful thing for SUCH minds to have the ascendancy for a time Itwould be an error to consider the highly developed and independentlysoaring minds as specially qualified for determining and collecting manylittle common facts and deducing conclusions from them; as exceptionsthey are rather from the first in no very favourable position towardsthose who are the rules. After all they have more to do than merelyto perceive:--in effect they have to BE something new they have toSIGNIFY something new they have to REPRESENT new values! The gulfbetween knowledge and capacity is perhaps greater and also moremysterious than one thinks: the capable man in the grand style thecreator will possibly have to be an ignorant person;--while on theother hand for scientific discoveries like those of Darwin a certainnarrowness aridity and industrious carefulness in short somethingEnglish may not be unfavourable for arriving at them.--Finally letit not be forgotten that the English with their profound mediocritybrought about once before a general depression of European intelligence.What is called modern ideas or the ideas of the eighteenth centuryor French ideas--that consequently against which the GERMAN mindrose up with profound disgust--is of English origin there is no doubtabout it. The French were only the apes and actors of these ideas theirbest soldiers and likewise alas! their first and profoundest VICTIMS;for owing to the diabolical Anglomania of modern ideas the AMEFRANCAIS has in the end become so thin and emaciated that at presentone recalls its sixteenth and seventeenth centuries its profoundpassionate strength its inventive excellency almost with disbelief.One must however maintain this verdict of historical justice ina determined manner and defend it against present prejudices andappearances: the European NOBLESSE--of sentiment taste and mannerstaking the word in every high sense--is the work and invention ofFRANCE; the European ignobleness the plebeianism of modern ideas--isENGLANDS work and invention.. Even at present France is still the seat of the most intellectualand refined culture of Europe it is still the high school of taste; butone must know how to find this France of taste. He who belongs to itkeeps himself well concealed:--they may be a small number in whom itlives and is embodied besides perhaps being men who do not stand uponthe strongest legs in part fatalists hypochondriacs invalids inpart persons over-indulged over-refined such as have the AMBITION toconceal themselves.They have all something in common: they keep their ears closed inpresence of the delirious folly and noisy spouting of the democraticBOURGEOIS. In fact a besotted and brutalized France at present sprawlsin the foreground--it recently celebrated a veritable orgy of bad tasteand at the same time of self-admiration at the funeral of Victor Hugo.There is also something else common to them: a predilection to resistintellectual Germanizing--and a still greater inability to do so!In this France of intellect which is also a France of pessimismSchopenhauer has perhaps become more at home and more indigenous thanhe has ever been in Germany; not to speak of Heinrich Heine who haslong ago been re-incarnated in the more refined and fastidious lyristsof Paris; or of Hegel who at present in the form of Taine--the FIRSTof living historians--exercises an almost tyrannical influence. Asregards Richard Wagner however the more French music learns toadapt itself to the actual needs of the AME MODERNE the more will itWagnerite; one can safely predict that beforehand--it is alreadytaking place sufficiently! There are however three things which theFrench can still boast of with pride as their heritage and possessionand as indelible tokens of their ancient intellectual superiorityin Europe in spite of all voluntary or involuntary Germanizing andvulgarizing of taste. FIRSTLY the capacity for artistic emotion fordevotion to form for which the expression LART POUR LART alongwith numerous others has been invented:--such capacity has not beenlacking in France for three centuries; and owing to its reverence forthe small number it has again and again made a sort of chambermusic of literature possible which is sought for in vain elsewherein Europe.--The SECOND thing whereby the French can lay claim toa superiority over Europe is their ancient many-sided MORALISTICculture owing to which one finds on an average even in the pettyROMANCIERS of the newspapers and chance BOULEVARDIERS DE PARIS apsychological sensitiveness and curiosity of which for example onehas no conception to say nothing of the thing itself! in Germany.The Germans lack a couple of centuries of the moralistic work requisitethereto which as we have said France has not grudged: those who callthe Germans naive on that account give them commendation for a defect.As the opposite of the German inexperience and innocence IN VOLUPTATEPSYCHOLOGICA which is not too remotely associated with the tediousnessof German intercourse--and as the most successful expression ofgenuine French curiosity and inventive talent in this domain of delicatethrills Henri Beyle may be noted; that remarkable anticipatory andforerunning man who with a Napoleonic TEMPO traversed HIS Europein fact several centuries of the European soul as a surveyor anddiscoverer thereof:--it has required two generations to OVERTAKE himone way or other to divine long afterwards some of the riddlesthat perplexed and enraptured him--this strange Epicurean and man ofinterrogation the last great psychologist of France.--There is yeta THIRD claim to superiority: in the French character there is asuccessful half-way synthesis of the North and South which makes themcomprehend many things and enjoins upon them other things which anEnglishman can never comprehend. Their temperament turned alternatelyto and from the South in which from time to time the Provencal andLigurian blood froths over preserves them from the dreadful northerngrey-in-grey from sunless conceptual-spectrism and from poverty ofblood--our GERMAN infirmity of taste for the excessive prevalenceof which at the present moment blood and iron that is to say highpolitics has with great resolution been prescribed according toa dangerous healing art which bids me wait and wait but not yethope.--There is also still in France a pre-understanding andready welcome for those rarer and rarely gratified men who are toocomprehensive to find satisfaction in any kind of fatherlandism andknow how to love the South when in the North and the North when in theSouth--the born Midlanders the good Europeans. For them BIZEThas made music this latest genius who has seen a new beauty andseduction--who has discovered a piece of the SOUTH IN MUSIC.. I hold that many precautions should be taken against German music.Suppose a person loves the South as I love it--as a great schoolof recovery for the most spiritual and the most sensuous ills as aboundless solar profusion and effulgence which oerspreads a sovereignexistence believing in itself--well such a person will learn to besomewhat on his guard against German music because in injuring histaste anew it will also injure his health anew. Such a Southerner aSoutherner not by origin but by BELIEF if he should dream of the futureof music must also dream of it being freed from the influence of theNorth; and must have in his ears the prelude to a deeper mightier andperhaps more perverse and mysterious music a super-German music whichdoes not fade pale and die away as all German music does at thesight of the blue wanton sea and the Mediterranean clearness of sky--asuper-European music which holds its own even in presence of the brownsunsets of the desert whose soul is akin to the palm-tree and can beat home and can roam with big beautiful lonely beasts of prey... Icould imagine a music of which the rarest charm would be that it knewnothing more of good and evil; only that here and there perhaps somesailors home-sickness some golden shadows and tender weaknesses mightsweep lightly over it; an art which from the far distance would seethe colours of a sinking and almost incomprehensible MORAL world fleeingtowards it and would be hospitable enough and profound enough toreceive such belated fugitives.. Owing to the morbid estrangement which the nationality-craze hasinduced and still induces among the nations of Europe owing also to theshort-sighted and hasty-handed politicians who with the help of thiscraze are at present in power and do not suspect to what extent thedisintegrating policy they pursue must necessarily be only an interludepolicy--owing to all this and much else that is altogether unmentionableat present the most unmistakable signs that EUROPE WISHES TO BE ONEare now overlooked or arbitrarily and falsely misinterpreted. With allthe more profound and large-minded men of this century the real generaltendency of the mysterious labour of their souls was to prepare the wayfor that new SYNTHESIS and tentatively to anticipate the European ofthe future; only in their simulations or in their weaker moments inold age perhaps did they belong to the fatherlands--they only restedfrom themselves when they became patriots. I think of such men asNapoleon Goethe Beethoven Stendhal Heinrich Heine Schopenhauer: itmust not be taken amiss if I also count Richard Wagner among them aboutwhom one must not let oneself be deceived by his own misunderstandingsgeniuses like him have seldom the right to understand themselvesstill less of course by the unseemly noise with which he is nowresisted and opposed in France: the fact remains nevertheless thatRichard Wagner and the LATER FRENCH ROMANTICISM of the forties aremost closely and intimately related to one another. They are akinfundamentally akin in all the heights and depths of their requirements;it is Europe the ONE Europe whose soul presses urgently and longinglyoutwards and upwards in their multifarious and boisterous art--whitherinto a new light towards a new sun But who would attempt to expressaccurately what all these masters of new modes of speech could notexpress distinctly It is certain that the same storm and stresstormented them that they SOUGHT in the same manner these last greatseekers! All of them steeped in literature to their eyes and ears--thefirst artists of universal literary culture--for the most part eventhemselves writers poets intermediaries and blenders of the arts andthe senses Wagner as musician is reckoned among painters as poetamong musicians as artist generally among actors; all of them fanaticsfor EXPRESSION at any cost--I specially mention Delacroix the nearestrelated to Wagner; all of them great discoverers in the realm of thesublime also of the loathsome and dreadful still greater discoverersin effect in display in the art of the show-shop; all of them talentedfar beyond their genius out and out VIRTUOSI with mysterious accessesto all that seduces allures constrains and upsets; born enemies oflogic and of the straight line hankering after the strange theexotic the monstrous the crooked and the self-contradictory; as menTantaluses of the will plebeian parvenus who knew themselves to beincapable of a noble TEMPO or of a LENTO in life and action--thinkof Balzac for instance--unrestrained workers almost destroyingthemselves by work; antinomians and rebels in manners ambitious andinsatiable without equilibrium and enjoyment; all of them finallyshattering and sinking down at the Christian cross and with rightand reason for who of them would have been sufficiently profound andsufficiently original for an ANTI-CHRISTIAN philosophy;--on thewhole a boldly daring splendidly overbearing high-flying andaloft-up-dragging class of higher men who had first to teach theircentury--and it is the century of the MASSES--the conception higherman.... Let the German friends of Richard Wagner advise together as towhether there is anything purely German in the Wagnerian art or whetherits distinction does not consist precisely in coming from SUPER-GERMANsources and impulses: in which connection it may not be underratedhow indispensable Paris was to the development of his type which thestrength of his instincts made him long to visit at the mostdecisive time--and how the whole style of his proceedings of hisself-apostolate could only perfect itself in sight of the Frenchsocialistic original. On a more subtle comparison it will perhaps befound to the honour of Richard Wagners German nature that he hasacted in everything with more strength daring severity and elevationthan a nineteenth-century Frenchman could have done--owing to thecircumstance that we Germans are as yet nearer to barbarism than theFrench;--perhaps even the most remarkable creation of Richard Wagner isnot only at present but for ever inaccessible incomprehensible andinimitable to the whole latter-day Latin race: the figure of Siegfriedthat VERY FREE man who is probably far too free too hard toocheerful too healthy too ANTI-CATHOLIC for the taste of old and mellowcivilized nations. He may even have been a sin against Romanticism thisanti-Latin Siegfried: well Wagner atoned amply for this sin in his oldsad days when--anticipating a taste which has meanwhile passed intopolitics--he began with the religious vehemence peculiar to him topreach at least THE WAY TO ROME if not to walk therein.--Thatthese last words may not be misunderstood I will call to my aid a fewpowerful rhymes which will even betray to less delicate ears what Imean--what I mean COUNTER TO the last Wagner and his Parsifal music:----Is this our mode--From German heart came this vexed ululating FromGerman body this self-lacerating Is ours this priestly hand-dilationThis incense-fuming exaltation Is ours this faltering fallingshambling This quite uncertain ding-dong-dangling This slynun-ogling Ave-hour-bell ringing This wholly false enrapturedheaven-oerspringing--Is this our mode--Think well!--ye still wait foradmission--For what ye hear is ROME--ROMES FAITH BY INTUITION!CHAPTER IX. WHAT IS NOBLE. EVERY elevation of the type man has hitherto been the work of anaristocratic society and so it will always be--a society believing ina long scale of gradations of rank and differences of worth among humanbeings and requiring slavery in some form or other. Without the PATHOSOF DISTANCE such as grows out of the incarnated difference of classesout of the constant out-looking and down-looking of the ruling caste onsubordinates and instruments and out of their equally constantpractice of obeying and commanding of keeping down and keeping at adistance--that other more mysterious pathos could never have arisen thelonging for an ever new widening of distance within the soul itselfthe formation of ever higher rarer further more extended morecomprehensive states in short just the elevation of the type manthe continued self-surmounting of man to use a moral formula ina supermoral sense. To be sure one must not resign oneself toany humanitarian illusions about the history of the origin of anaristocratic society that is to say of the preliminary condition forthe elevation of the type man: the truth is hard. Let us acknowledgeunprejudicedly how every higher civilization hitherto has ORIGINATED!Men with a still natural nature barbarians in every terrible sense ofthe word men of prey still in possession of unbroken strength of willand desire for power threw themselves upon weaker more moral morepeaceful races perhaps trading or cattle-rearing communities or uponold mellow civilizations in which the final vital force was flickeringout in brilliant fireworks of wit and depravity. At the commencementthe noble caste was always the barbarian caste: their superiority didnot consist first of all in their physical but in their psychicalpower--they were more COMPLETE men which at every point also impliesthe same as more complete beasts.. Corruption--as the indication that anarchy threatens to break outamong the instincts and that the foundation of the emotions calledlife is convulsed--is something radically different according tothe organization in which it manifests itself. When for instance anaristocracy like that of France at the beginning of the Revolutionflung away its privileges with sublime disgust and sacrificed itselfto an excess of its moral sentiments it was corruption:--it was reallyonly the closing act of the corruption which had existed for centuriesby virtue of which that aristocracy had abdicated step by step itslordly prerogatives and lowered itself to a FUNCTION of royalty inthe end even to its decoration and parade-dress. The essential thinghowever in a good and healthy aristocracy is that it should not regarditself as a function either of the kingship or the commonwealth butas the SIGNIFICANCE and highest justification thereof--that it shouldtherefore accept with a good conscience the sacrifice of a legionof individuals who FOR ITS SAKE must be suppressed and reduced toimperfect men to slaves and instruments. Its fundamental belief mustbe precisely that society is NOT allowed to exist for its own sake butonly as a foundation and scaffolding by means of which a select classof beings may be able to elevate themselves to their higher duties andin general to a higher EXISTENCE: like those sun-seeking climbing plantsin Java--they are called Sipo Matador--which encircle an oak solong and so often with their arms until at last high above it butsupported by it they can unfold their tops in the open light andexhibit their happiness.. To refrain mutually from injury from violence from exploitationand put ones will on a par with that of others: this may result in acertain rough sense in good conduct among individuals when the necessaryconditions are given namely the actual similarity of the individualsin amount of force and degree of worth and their co-relation within oneorganization. As soon however as one wished to take this principlemore generally and if possible even as the FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OFSOCIETY it would immediately disclose what it really is--namely a Willto the DENIAL of life a principle of dissolution and decay. Here onemust think profoundly to the very basis and resist all sentimentalweakness: life itself is ESSENTIALLY appropriation injury conquestof the strange and weak suppression severity obtrusion ofpeculiar forms incorporation and at the least putting it mildestexploitation;--but why should one for ever use precisely these wordson which for ages a disparaging purpose has been stamped Even theorganization within which as was previously supposed theindividuals treat each other as equal--it takes place in everyhealthy aristocracy--must itself if it be a living and not a dyingorganization do all that towards other bodies which the individualswithin it refrain from doing to each other it will have to be theincarnated Will to Power it will endeavour to grow to gain groundattract to itself and acquire ascendancy--not owing to any morality orimmorality but because it LIVES and because life IS precisely Will toPower. On no point however is the ordinary consciousness of Europeansmore unwilling to be corrected than on this matter people now raveeverywhere even under the guise of science about coming conditions ofsociety in which the exploiting character is to be absent--that soundsto my ears as if they promised to invent a mode of life which shouldrefrain from all organic functions. Exploitation does not belong to adepraved or imperfect and primitive society it belongs to the nature ofthe living being as a primary organic function it is a consequenceof the intrinsic Will to Power which is precisely the Will toLife--Granting that as a theory this is a novelty--as a reality it isthe FUNDAMENTAL FACT of all history let us be so far honest towardsourselves!. In a tour through the many finer and coarser moralities which havehitherto prevailed or still prevail on the earth I found certain traitsrecurring regularly together and connected with one another untilfinally two primary types revealed themselves to me and a radicaldistinction was brought to light. There is MASTER-MORALITY andSLAVE-MORALITY--I would at once add however that in all higher andmixed civilizations there are also attempts at the reconciliation ofthe two moralities but one finds still oftener the confusion andmutual misunderstanding of them indeed sometimes their closejuxtaposition--even in the same man within one soul. The distinctionsof moral values have either originated in a ruling caste pleasantlyconscious of being different from the ruled--or among the ruled classthe slaves and dependents of all sorts. In the first case when it isthe rulers who determine the conception good it is the exalted prouddisposition which is regarded as the distinguishing feature and thatwhich determines the order of rank. The noble type of man separatesfrom himself the beings in whom the opposite of this exalted prouddisposition displays itself he despises them. Let it at once be notedthat in this first kind of morality the antithesis good and badmeans practically the same as noble and despicable--the antithesisgood and EVIL is of a different origin. The cowardly the timid theinsignificant and those thinking merely of narrow utility are despised;moreover also the distrustful with their constrained glances theself-abasing the dog-like kind of men who let themselves be abusedthe mendicant flatterers and above all the liars:--it is a fundamentalbelief of all aristocrats that the common people are untruthful. Wetruthful ones--the nobility in ancient Greece called themselves. It isobvious that everywhere the designations of moral value were at firstapplied to MEN; and were only derivatively and at a later period appliedto ACTIONS; it is a gross mistake therefore when historians of moralsstart with questions like Why have sympathetic actions been praisedThe noble type of man regards HIMSELF as a determiner of values; hedoes not require to be approved of; he passes the judgment: What isinjurious to me is injurious in itself; he knows that it is he himselfonly who confers honour on things; he is a CREATOR OF VALUES. Hehonours whatever he recognizes in himself: such morality equalsself-glorification. In the foreground there is the feeling of plenitudeof power which seeks to overflow the happiness of high tension theconsciousness of a wealth which would fain give and bestow:--the nobleman also helps the unfortunate but not--or scarcely--out of pity butrather from an impulse generated by the super-abundance of power. Thenoble man honours in himself the powerful one him also who has powerover himself who knows how to speak and how to keep silence whotakes pleasure in subjecting himself to severity and hardness and hasreverence for all that is severe and hard. Wotan placed a hard heart inmy breast says an old Scandinavian Saga: it is thus rightly expressedfrom the soul of a proud Viking. Such a type of man is even proud of notbeing made for sympathy; the hero of the Saga therefore adds warningly:He who has not a hard heart when young will never have one. The nobleand brave who think thus are the furthest removed from the moralitywhich sees precisely in sympathy or in acting for the good of othersor in DESINTERESSEMENT the characteristic of the moral; faithin oneself pride in oneself a radical enmity and irony towardsselflessness belong as definitely to noble morality as do a carelessscorn and precaution in presence of sympathy and the warm heart.--Itis the powerful who KNOW how to honour it is their art their domainfor invention. The profound reverence for age and for tradition--all lawrests on this double reverence--the belief and prejudice in favour ofancestors and unfavourable to newcomers is typical in the morality ofthe powerful; and if reversely men of modern ideas believe almostinstinctively in progress and the future and are more and morelacking in respect for old age the ignoble origin of these ideas hascomplacently betrayed itself thereby. A morality of the ruling classhowever is more especially foreign and irritating to present-day tastein the sternness of its principle that one has duties only to onesequals; that one may act towards beings of a lower rank towards allthat is foreign just as seems good to one or as the heart desiresand in any case beyond good and evil: it is here that sympathy andsimilar sentiments can have a place. The ability and obligation toexercise prolonged gratitude and prolonged revenge--both only within thecircle of equals--artfulness in retaliation RAFFINEMENT of the ideain friendship a certain necessity to have enemies as outlets for theemotions of envy quarrelsomeness arrogance--in fact in order to bea good FRIEND: all these are typical characteristics of the noblemorality which as has been pointed out is not the morality of modernideas and is therefore at present difficult to realize and also tounearth and disclose.--It is otherwise with the second type of moralitySLAVE-MORALITY. Supposing that the abused the oppressed the sufferingthe unemancipated the weary and those uncertain of themselves shouldmoralize what will be the common element in their moral estimatesProbably a pessimistic suspicion with regard to the entire situation ofman will find expression perhaps a condemnation of man together withhis situation. The slave has an unfavourable eye for the virtues of thepowerful; he has a skepticism and distrust a REFINEMENT of distrust ofeverything good that is there honoured--he would fain persuade himselfthat the very happiness there is not genuine. On the other hand THOSEqualities which serve to alleviate the existence of sufferers arebrought into prominence and flooded with light; it is here thatsympathy the kind helping hand the warm heart patience diligencehumility and friendliness attain to honour; for here these are the mostuseful qualities and almost the only means of supporting the burden ofexistence. Slave-morality is essentially the morality of utility.Here is the seat of the origin of the famous antithesis good andevil:--power and dangerousness are assumed to reside in the evila certain dreadfulness subtlety and strength which do not admit ofbeing despised. According to slave-morality therefore the evil manarouses fear; according to master-morality it is precisely the goodman who arouses fear and seeks to arouse it while the bad man isregarded as the despicable being. The contrast attains its maximum whenin accordance with the logical consequences of slave-morality a shadeof depreciation--it may be slight and well-intentioned--at last attachesitself to the good man of this morality; because according to theservile mode of thought the good man must in any case be the SAFEman: he is good-natured easily deceived perhaps a little stupid unbonhomme. Everywhere that slave-morality gains the ascendancy languageshows a tendency to approximate the significations of the words goodand stupid.--A last fundamental difference: the desire for FREEDOMthe instinct for happiness and the refinements of the feeling of libertybelong as necessarily to slave-morals and morality as artifice andenthusiasm in reverence and devotion are the regular symptoms of anaristocratic mode of thinking and estimating.--Hence we can understandwithout further detail why love AS A PASSION--it is our Europeanspecialty--must absolutely be of noble origin; as is well known itsinvention is due to the Provencal poet-cavaliers those brilliantingenious men of the gai saber to whom Europe owes so much andalmost owes itself.. Vanity is one of the things which are perhaps most difficult fora noble man to understand: he will be tempted to deny it where anotherkind of man thinks he sees it self-evidently. The problem for him isto represent to his mind beings who seek to arouse a good opinion ofthemselves which they themselves do not possess--and consequently alsodo not deserve--and who yet BELIEVE in this good opinionafterwards. This seems to him on the one hand such bad taste and soself-disrespectful and on the other hand so grotesquely unreasonablethat he would like to consider vanity an exception and is doubtfulabout it in most cases when it is spoken of. He will say forinstance: I may be mistaken about my value and on the other handmay nevertheless demand that my value should be acknowledged by othersprecisely as I rate it:--that however is not vanity but self-conceitor in most cases that which is called humility and alsomodesty. Or he will even say: For many reasons I can delight inthe good opinion of others perhaps because I love and honour themand rejoice in all their joys perhaps also because their good opinionendorses and strengthens my belief in my own good opinion perhapsbecause the good opinion of others even in cases where I do not shareit is useful to me or gives promise of usefulness:--all this howeveris not vanity. The man of noble character must first bring it homeforcibly to his mind especially with the aid of history that fromtime immemorial in all social strata in any way dependent the ordinaryman WAS only that which he PASSED FOR:--not being at all accustomed tofix values he did not assign even to himself any other value than thatwhich his master assigned to him it is the peculiar RIGHT OF MASTERS tocreate values. It may be looked upon as the result of an extraordinaryatavism that the ordinary man even at present is still always WAITINGfor an opinion about himself and then instinctively submitting himselfto it; yet by no means only to a good opinion but also to a badand unjust one think for instance of the greater part of theself-appreciations and self-depreciations which believing women learnfrom their confessors and which in general the believing Christianlearns from his Church. In fact conformably to the slow rise of thedemocratic social order and its cause the blending of the bloodof masters and slaves the originally noble and rare impulse ofthe masters to assign a value to themselves and to think well ofthemselves will now be more and more encouraged and extended; butit has at all times an older ampler and more radically ingrainedpropensity opposed to it--and in the phenomenon of vanity this olderpropensity overmasters the younger. The vain person rejoices over EVERYgood opinion which he hears about himself quite apart from the pointof view of its usefulness and equally regardless of its truth orfalsehood just as he suffers from every bad opinion: for he subjectshimself to both he feels himself subjected to both by that oldestinstinct of subjection which breaks forth in him.--It is the slavein the vain mans blood the remains of the slaves craftiness--and howmuch of the slave is still left in woman for instance!--whichseeks to SEDUCE to good opinions of itself; it is the slave too whoimmediately afterwards falls prostrate himself before these opinions asthough he had not called them forth.--And to repeat it again: vanity isan atavism.. A SPECIES originates and a type becomes established and strong inthe long struggle with essentially constant UNFAVOURABLE conditions. Onthe other hand it is known by the experience of breeders that specieswhich receive super-abundant nourishment and in general a surplus ofprotection and care immediately tend in the most marked way to developvariations and are fertile in prodigies and monstrosities also inmonstrous vices. Now look at an aristocratic commonwealth sayan ancient Greek polis or Venice as a voluntary or involuntarycontrivance for the purpose of REARING human beings; there are there menbeside one another thrown upon their own resources who want to maketheir species prevail chiefly because they MUST prevail or elserun the terrible danger of being exterminated. The favour thesuper-abundance the protection are there lacking under which variationsare fostered; the species needs itself as species as something whichprecisely by virtue of its hardness its uniformity and simplicity ofstructure can in general prevail and make itself permanent inconstant struggle with its neighbours or with rebellious orrebellion-threatening vassals. The most varied experience teaches itwhat are the qualities to which it principally owes the fact thatit still exists in spite of all Gods and men and has hitherto beenvictorious: these qualities it calls virtues and these virtues aloneit develops to maturity. It does so with severity indeed it desiresseverity; every aristocratic morality is intolerant in the educationof youth in the control of women in the marriage customs in therelations of old and young in the penal laws which have an eye onlyfor the degenerating: it counts intolerance itself among the virtuesunder the name of justice. A type with few but very marked featuresa species of severe warlike wisely silent reserved and reticentmen and as such with the most delicate sensibility for the charm andnuances of society is thus established unaffected by the vicissitudesof generations; the constant struggle with uniform UNFAVOURABLEconditions is as already remarked the cause of a type becomingstable and hard. Finally however a happy state of things results theenormous tension is relaxed; there are perhaps no more enemies among theneighbouring peoples and the means of life even of the enjoymentof life are present in superabundance. With one stroke the bond andconstraint of the old discipline severs: it is no longer regarded asnecessary as a condition of existence--if it would continue it canonly do so as a form of LUXURY as an archaizing TASTE. Variationswhether they be deviations into the higher finer and rarer ordeteriorations and monstrosities appear suddenly on the scene in thegreatest exuberance and splendour; the individual dares to be individualand detach himself. At this turning-point of history there manifestthemselves side by side and often mixed and entangled together amagnificent manifold virgin-forest-like up-growth and up-striving akind of TROPICAL TEMPO in the rivalry of growth and an extraordinarydecay and self-destruction owing to the savagely opposing and seeminglyexploding egoisms which strive with one another for sun and lightand can no longer assign any limit restraint or forbearance forthemselves by means of the hitherto existing morality. It was thismorality itself which piled up the strength so enormously which bentthe bow in so threatening a manner:--it is now out of date it isgetting out of date. The dangerous and disquieting point has beenreached when the greater more manifold more comprehensive life ISLIVED BEYOND the old morality; the individual stands out and isobliged to have recourse to his own law-giving his own arts andartifices for self-preservation self-elevation and self-deliverance.Nothing but new Whys nothing but new Hows no common formulas anylonger misunderstanding and disregard in league with each other decaydeterioration and the loftiest desires frightfully entangled thegenius of the race overflowing from all the cornucopias of good and bada portentous simultaneousness of Spring and Autumn full of new charmsand mysteries peculiar to the fresh still inexhausted still unweariedcorruption. Danger is again present the mother of morality greatdanger; this time shifted into the individual into the neighbour andfriend into the street into their own child into their own heartinto all the most personal and secret recesses of their desires andvolitions. What will the moral philosophers who appear at this time haveto preach They discover these sharp onlookers and loafers that theend is quickly approaching that everything around them decays andproduces decay that nothing will endure until the day after tomorrowexcept one species of man the incurably MEDIOCRE. The mediocre alonehave a prospect of continuing and propagating themselves--they willbe the men of the future the sole survivors; be like them! becomemediocre! is now the only morality which has still a significancewhich still obtains a hearing.--But it is difficult to preach thismorality of mediocrity! it can never avow what it is and what itdesires! it has to talk of moderation and dignity and duty and brotherlylove--it will have difficulty IN CONCEALING ITS IRONY!. There is an INSTINCT FOR RANK which more than anything else isalready the sign of a HIGH rank; there is a DELIGHT in the NUANCESof reverence which leads one to infer noble origin and habits. Therefinement goodness and loftiness of a soul are put to a perilous testwhen something passes by that is of the highest rank but is notyet protected by the awe of authority from obtrusive touches andincivilities: something that goes its way like a living touchstoneundistinguished undiscovered and tentative perhaps voluntarily veiledand disguised. He whose task and practice it is to investigate soulswill avail himself of many varieties of this very art to determine theultimate value of a soul the unalterable innate order of rank to whichit belongs: he will test it by its INSTINCT FOR REVERENCE. DIFFERENCEENGENDRE HAINE: the vulgarity of many a nature spurts up suddenly likedirty water when any holy vessel any jewel from closed shrines anybook bearing the marks of great destiny is brought before it; whileon the other hand there is an involuntary silence a hesitation of theeye a cessation of all gestures by which it is indicated that a soulFEELS the nearness of what is worthiest of respect. The way in which onthe whole the reverence for the BIBLE has hitherto been maintainedin Europe is perhaps the best example of discipline and refinement ofmanners which Europe owes to Christianity: books of such profoundnessand supreme significance require for their protection an externaltyranny of authority in order to acquire the PERIOD of thousands ofyears which is necessary to exhaust and unriddle them. Much has beenachieved when the sentiment has been at last instilled into the massesthe shallow-pates and the boobies of every kind that they are notallowed to touch everything that there are holy experiences beforewhich they must take off their shoes and keep away the unclean hand--itis almost their highest advance towards humanity. On the contrary inthe so-called cultured classes the believers in modern ideas nothingis perhaps so repulsive as their lack of shame the easy insolence ofeye and hand with which they touch taste and finger everything; and itis possible that even yet there is more RELATIVE nobility of taste andmore tact for reverence among the people among the lower classes ofthe people especially among peasants than among the newspaper-readingDEMIMONDE of intellect the cultured class.. It cannot be effaced from a mans soul what his ancestors havepreferably and most constantly done: whether they were perhaps diligenteconomizers attached to a desk and a cash-box modest and citizen-likein their desires modest also in their virtues; or whether they wereaccustomed to commanding from morning till night fond of rude pleasuresand probably of still ruder duties and responsibilities; or whetherfinally at one time or another they have sacrificed old privileges ofbirth and possession in order to live wholly for their faith--for theirGod--as men of an inexorable and sensitive conscience which blushesat every compromise. It is quite impossible for a man NOT to havethe qualities and predilections of his parents and ancestors in hisconstitution whatever appearances may suggest to the contrary. This isthe problem of race. Granted that one knows something of the parentsit is admissible to draw a conclusion about the child: any kindof offensive incontinence any kind of sordid envy or of clumsyself-vaunting--the three things which together have constituted thegenuine plebeian type in all times--such must pass over to the child assurely as bad blood; and with the help of the best education and cultureone will only succeed in DECEIVING with regard to such heredity.--Andwhat else does education and culture try to do nowadays! In our verydemocratic or rather very plebeian age education and culture MUSTbe essentially the art of deceiving--deceiving with regard to originwith regard to the inherited plebeianism in body and soul. An educatorwho nowadays preached truthfulness above everything else and called outconstantly to his pupils: Be true! Be natural! Show yourselves as youare!--even such a virtuous and sincere ass would learn in a short timeto have recourse to the FURCA of Horace NATURAM EXPELLERE: with whatresults Plebeianism USQUE RECURRET. FOOTNOTE: Horaces EpistlesI. x. .. At the risk of displeasing innocent ears I submit that egoismbelongs to the essence of a noble soul I mean the unalterable beliefthat to a being such as we other beings must naturally be insubjection and have to sacrifice themselves. The noble soul accepts thefact of his egoism without question and also without consciousness ofharshness constraint or arbitrariness therein but rather as somethingthat may have its basis in the primary law of things:--if he sought adesignation for it he would say: It is justice itself. He acknowledgesunder certain circumstances which made him hesitate at first thatthere are other equally privileged ones; as soon as he has settled thisquestion of rank he moves among those equals and equally privilegedones with the same assurance as regards modesty and delicate respectwhich he enjoys in intercourse with himself--in accordance with aninnate heavenly mechanism which all the stars understand. It is anADDITIONAL instance of his egoism this artfulness and self-limitationin intercourse with his equals--every star is a similar egoist; hehonours HIMSELF in them and in the rights which he concedes to them hehas no doubt that the exchange of honours and rights as the ESSENCE ofall intercourse belongs also to the natural condition of things. Thenoble soul gives as he takes prompted by the passionate and sensitiveinstinct of requital which is at the root of his nature. The notion offavour has INTER PARES neither significance nor good repute; theremay be a sublime way of letting gifts as it were light upon one fromabove and of drinking them thirstily like dew-drops; but for thosearts and displays the noble soul has no aptitude. His egoism hinders himhere: in general he looks aloft unwillingly--he looks either FORWARDhorizontally and deliberately or downwards--HE KNOWS THAT HE IS ON AHEIGHT.. One can only truly esteem him who does not LOOK OUT FORhimself.--Goethe to Rath Schlosser.. The Chinese have a proverb which mothers even teach their children:SIAO-SIN MAKE THY HEART SMALL. This is the essentially fundamentaltendency in latter-day civilizations. I have no doubt that an ancientGreek also would first of all remark the self-dwarfing in us Europeansof today--in this respect alone we should immediately be distastefulto him.. What after all is ignobleness--Words are vocal symbols forideas; ideas however are more or less definite mental symbolsfor frequently returning and concurring sensations for groups ofsensations. It is not sufficient to use the same words in order tounderstand one another: we must also employ the same words for the samekind of internal experiences we must in the end have experiences INCOMMON. On this account the people of one nation understand one anotherbetter than those belonging to different nations even when they usethe same language; or rather when people have lived long together undersimilar conditions of climate soil danger requirement toil thereORIGINATES therefrom an entity that understands itself--namely anation. In all souls a like number of frequently recurring experienceshave gained the upper hand over those occurring more rarely: aboutthese matters people understand one another rapidly and always morerapidly--the history of language is the history of a process ofabbreviation; on the basis of this quick comprehension people alwaysunite closer and closer. The greater the danger the greater is theneed of agreeing quickly and readily about what is necessary; not tomisunderstand one another in danger--that is what cannot at all bedispensed with in intercourse. Also in all loves and friendships one hasthe experience that nothing of the kind continues when the discoveryhas been made that in using the same words one of the two parties hasfeelings thoughts intuitions wishes or fears different from those ofthe other. The fear of the eternal misunderstanding: that is the goodgenius which so often keeps persons of different sexes from toohasty attachments to which sense and heart prompt them--and NOT someSchopenhauerian genius of the species! Whichever groups of sensationswithin a soul awaken most readily begin to speak and give the word ofcommand--these decide as to the general order of rank of its values anddetermine ultimately its list of desirable things. A mans estimates ofvalue betray something of the STRUCTURE of his soul and wherein itsees its conditions of life its intrinsic needs. Supposing now thatnecessity has from all time drawn together only such men as couldexpress similar requirements and similar experiences by similar symbolsit results on the whole that the easy COMMUNICABILITY of needwhich implies ultimately the undergoing only of average and COMMONexperiences must have been the most potent of all the forces whichhave hitherto operated upon mankind. The more similar the more ordinarypeople have always had and are still having the advantage; the moreselect more refined more unique and difficultly comprehensible areliable to stand alone; they succumb to accidents in their isolation andseldom propagate themselves. One must appeal to immense opposing forcesin order to thwart this natural all-too-natural PROGRESSUS IN SIMILEthe evolution of man to the similar the ordinary the average thegregarious--to the IGNOBLE--!. The more a psychologist--a born an unavoidable psychologistand soul-diviner--turns his attention to the more select cases andindividuals the greater is his danger of being suffocated by sympathy:he NEEDS sternness and cheerfulness more than any other man. Forthe corruption the ruination of higher men of the more unusuallyconstituted souls is in fact the rule: it is dreadful to have such arule always before ones eyes. The manifold torment of the psychologistwho has discovered this ruination who discovers once and thendiscovers ALMOST repeatedly throughout all history this universalinner desperateness of higher men this eternal too late! in everysense--may perhaps one day be the cause of his turning withbitterness against his own lot and of his making an attempt atself-destruction--of his going to ruin himself. One may perceivein almost every psychologist a tell-tale inclination for delightfulintercourse with commonplace and well-ordered men; the fact is therebydisclosed that he always requires healing that he needs a sortof flight and forgetfulness away from what his insight andincisiveness--from what his business--has laid upon his conscience.The fear of his memory is peculiar to him. He is easily silenced by thejudgment of others; he hears with unmoved countenance how people honouradmire love and glorify where he has PERCEIVED--or he even concealshis silence by expressly assenting to some plausible opinion. Perhapsthe paradox of his situation becomes so dreadful that preciselywhere he has learnt GREAT SYMPATHY together with great CONTEMPT themultitude the educated and the visionaries have on their part learntgreat reverence--reverence for great men and marvelous animals forthe sake of whom one blesses and honours the fatherland the earth thedignity of mankind and ones own self to whom one points the youngand in view of whom one educates them. And who knows but in all greatinstances hitherto just the same happened: that the multitude worshippeda God and that the God was only a poor sacrificial animal! SUCCESShas always been the greatest liar--and the work itself is a success;the great statesman the conqueror the discoverer are disguised intheir creations until they are unrecognizable; the work of the artistof the philosopher only invents him who has created it is REPUTEDto have created it; the great men as they are reverenced are poorlittle fictions composed afterwards; in the world of historical valuesspurious coinage PREVAILS. Those great poets for example such asByron Musset Poe Leopardi Kleist Gogol I do not venture to mentionmuch greater names but I have them in my mind as they now appear andwere perhaps obliged to be: men of the moment enthusiastic sensuousand childish light-minded and impulsive in their trust and distrust;with souls in which usually some flaw has to be concealed; often takingrevenge with their works for an internal defilement often seekingforgetfulness in their soaring from a too true memory often lost inthe mud and almost in love with it until they become like theWill-o-the-Wisps around the swamps and PRETEND TO BE stars--the peoplethen call them idealists--often struggling with protracted disgustwith an ever-reappearing phantom of disbelief which makes them coldand obliges them to languish for GLORIA and devour faith as it isout of the hands of intoxicated adulators:--what a TORMENT these greatartists are and the so-called higher men in general to him who has oncefound them out! It is thus conceivable that it is just from woman--whois clairvoyant in the world of suffering and also unfortunately eagerto help and save to an extent far beyond her powers--that THEY havelearnt so readily those outbreaks of boundless devoted SYMPATHY whichthe multitude above all the reverent multitude do not understandand overwhelm with prying and self-gratifying interpretations. Thissympathizing invariably deceives itself as to its power; woman wouldlike to believe that love can do EVERYTHING--it is the SUPERSTITIONpeculiar to her. Alas he who knows the heart finds out how poorhelpless pretentious and blundering even the best and deepest loveis--he finds that it rather DESTROYS than saves!--It is possible thatunder the holy fable and travesty of the life of Jesus there is hiddenone of the most painful cases of the martyrdom of KNOWLEDGE ABOUT LOVE:the martyrdom of the most innocent and most craving heart thatnever had enough of any human love that DEMANDED love that demandedinexorably and frantically to be loved and nothing else with terribleoutbursts against those who refused him their love; the story of a poorsoul insatiated and insatiable in love that had to invent hell to sendthither those who WOULD NOT love him--and that at last enlightenedabout human love had to invent a God who is entire love entireCAPACITY for love--who takes pity on human love because it is sopaltry so ignorant! He who has such sentiments he who has suchKNOWLEDGE about love--SEEKS for death!--But why should one deal withsuch painful matters Provided of course that one is not obliged to doso.. The intellectual haughtiness and loathing of every man who hassuffered deeply--it almost determines the order of rank HOW deeply mencan suffer--the chilling certainty with which he is thoroughly imbuedand coloured that by virtue of his suffering he KNOWS MORE than theshrewdest and wisest can ever know that he has been familiar withand at home in many distant dreadful worlds of which YOU knownothing!--this silent intellectual haughtiness of the sufferer thispride of the elect of knowledge of the initiated of the almostsacrificed finds all forms of disguise necessary to protect itself fromcontact with officious and sympathizing hands and in general from allthat is not its equal in suffering. Profound suffering makes noble:it separates.--One of the most refined forms of disguise is Epicurismalong with a certain ostentatious boldness of taste which takessuffering lightly and puts itself on the defensive against all thatis sorrowful and profound. They are gay men who make use of gaietybecause they are misunderstood on account of it--they WISH to bemisunderstood. There are scientific minds who make use of sciencebecause it gives a gay appearance and because scientificness leads tothe conclusion that a person is superficial--they WISH to mislead to afalse conclusion. There are free insolent minds which would fain concealand deny that they are broken proud incurable hearts the cynicism ofHamlet--the case of Galiani; and occasionally folly itself is the maskof an unfortunate OVER-ASSURED knowledge.--From which it follows that itis the part of a more refined humanity to have reverence for the maskand not to make use of psychology and curiosity in the wrong place.. That which separates two men most profoundly is a different senseand grade of purity. What does it matter about all their honesty andreciprocal usefulness what does it matter about all their mutualgood-will: the fact still remains--they cannot smell each other! Thehighest instinct for purity places him who is affected with it in themost extraordinary and dangerous isolation as a saint: for it is justholiness--the highest spiritualization of the instinct in question. Anykind of cognizance of an indescribable excess in the joy of the bathany kind of ardour or thirst which perpetually impels the soul outof night into the morning and out of gloom out of affliction intoclearness brightness depth and refinement:--just as much as such atendency DISTINGUISHES--it is a noble tendency--it also SEPARATES.--Thepity of the saint is pity for the FILTH of the human all-too-human.And there are grades and heights where pity itself is regarded by him asimpurity as filth.. Signs of nobility: never to think of lowering our duties to therank of duties for everybody; to be unwilling to renounce or to shareour responsibilities; to count our prerogatives and the exercise ofthem among our DUTIES.. A man who strives after great things looks upon every one whomhe encounters on his way either as a means of advance or a delay andhindrance--or as a temporary resting-place. His peculiar lofty BOUNTYto his fellow-men is only possible when he attains his elevation anddominates. Impatience and the consciousness of being always condemnedto comedy up to that time--for even strife is a comedy and conceals theend as every means does--spoil all intercourse for him; this kind ofman is acquainted with solitude and what is most poisonous in it.. THE PROBLEM OF THOSE WHO WAIT.--Happy chances are necessary andmany incalculable elements in order that a higher man in whom thesolution of a problem is dormant may yet take action or break forthas one might say--at the right moment. On an average it DOES NOT happen;and in all corners of the earth there are waiting ones sitting whohardly know to what extent they are waiting and still less that theywait in vain. Occasionally too the waking call comes too late--thechance which gives permission to take action--when their best youthand strength for action have been used up in sitting still; and how manya one just as he sprang up has found with horror that his limbs arebenumbed and his spirits are now too heavy! It is too late he hassaid to himself--and has become self-distrustful and henceforth for everuseless.--In the domain of genius may not the Raphael withouthands taking the expression in its widest sense perhaps not be theexception but the rule--Perhaps genius is by no means so rare: butrather the five hundred HANDS which it requires in order to tyrannizeover the GREEK INSERTED HERE the right time--in order to takechance by the forelock!.

To haveor not to have ones emotions ones For and Against according tochoice; to lower oneself to them for hours; to SEAT oneself on them asupon horses and often as upon asses:--for one must know how to makeuse of their stupidity as well as of their fire. To conserve onesthree hundred foregrounds; also ones black spectacles: for there arecircumstances when nobody must look into our eyes still less into ourmotives. And to choose for company that roguish and cheerful vicepoliteness. And to remain master of ones four virtues courageinsight sympathy and solitude. For solitude is a virtue with us asa sublime bent and bias to purity which divines that in the contact ofman and man--in society--it must be unavoidably impure. All societymakes one somehow somewhere or sometime--commonplace.. The greatest events and thoughts--the greatest thoughts howeverare the greatest events--are longest in being comprehended: thegenerations which are contemporary with them do not EXPERIENCE suchevents--they live past them. Something happens there as in the realm ofstars. The light of the furthest stars is longest in reaching man; andbefore it has arrived man DENIES--that there are stars there. Howmany centuries does a mind require to be understood--that is also astandard one also makes a gradation of rank and an etiquette therewithsuch as is necessary for mind and for star.. Here is the prospect free the mind exalted. FOOTNOTE: GoethesFaust Part II Act V. The words of Dr. Marianus.--But there is areverse kind of man who is also upon a height and has also a freeprospect--but looks DOWNWARDS.. What is noble What does the word noble still mean for usnowadays How does the noble man betray himself how is he recognizedunder this heavy overcast sky of the commencing plebeianism by whicheverything is rendered opaque and leaden--It is not his actions whichestablish his claim--actions are always ambiguous always inscrutable;neither is it his works. One finds nowadays among artists and scholarsplenty of those who betray by their works that a profound longing fornobleness impels them; but this very NEED of nobleness is radicallydifferent from the needs of the noble soul itself and is in fact theeloquent and dangerous sign of the lack thereof. It is not the worksbut the BELIEF which is here decisive and determines the order ofrank--to employ once more an old religious formula with a new and deepermeaning--it is some fundamental certainty which a noble soul has aboutitself something which is not to be sought is not to be found andperhaps also is not to be lost.--THE NOBLE SOUL HAS REVERENCE FORITSELF.--. There are men who are unavoidably intellectual let them turnand twist themselves as they will and hold their hands before theirtreacherous eyes--as though the hand were not a betrayer; it alwayscomes out at last that they have something which they hide--namelyintellect. One of the subtlest means of deceiving at least as long aspossible and of successfully representing oneself to be stupiderthan one really is--which in everyday life is often as desirable asan umbrella--is called ENTHUSIASM including what belongs to it forinstance virtue. For as Galiani said who was obliged to know it: VERTUEST ENTHOUSIASME.. In the writings of a recluse one always hears something of the echoof the wilderness something of the murmuring tones and timid vigilanceof solitude; in his strongest words even in his cry itself theresounds a new and more dangerous kind of silence of concealment. He whohas sat day and night from years end to years end alone with hissoul in familiar discord and discourse he who has become a cave-bearor a treasure-seeker or a treasure-guardian and dragon in his cave--itmay be a labyrinth but can also be a gold-mine--his ideas themselveseventually acquire a twilight-colour of their own and an odour as muchof the depth as of the mould something uncommunicative and repulsivewhich blows chilly upon every passer-by. The recluse does not believethat a philosopher--supposing that a philosopher has always in the firstplace been a recluse--ever expressed his actual and ultimate opinions inbooks: are not books written precisely to hide what is in us--indeedhe will doubt whether a philosopher CAN have ultimate and actualopinions at all; whether behind every cave in him there is not and mustnecessarily be a still deeper cave: an ampler stranger richerworld beyond the surface an abyss behind every bottom beneath everyfoundation. Every philosophy is a foreground philosophy--this is arecluses verdict: There is something arbitrary in the fact that thePHILOSOPHER came to a stand here took a retrospect and looked around;that he HERE laid his spade aside and did not dig any deeper--thereis also something suspicious in it. Every philosophy also CONCEALS aphilosophy; every opinion is also a LURKING-PLACE every word is also aMASK.. Every deep thinker is more afraid of being understood than of beingmisunderstood. The latter perhaps wounds his vanity; but the formerwounds his heart his sympathy which always says: Ah why would youalso have as hard a time of it as I have. Man a COMPLEX mendacious artful and inscrutable animal uncannyto the other animals by his artifice and sagacity rather than by hisstrength has invented the good conscience in order finally to enjoy hissoul as something SIMPLE; and the whole of morality is a long audaciousfalsification by virtue of which generally enjoyment at the sight ofthe soul becomes possible. From this point of view there is perhaps muchmore in the conception of art than is generally believed.. A philosopher: that is a man who constantly experiences seeshears suspects hopes and dreams extraordinary things; who is struckby his own thoughts as if they came from the outside from above andbelow as a species of events and lightning-flashes PECULIAR TO HIM; whois perhaps himself a storm pregnant with new lightnings; a portentousman around whom there is always rumbling and mumbling and gaping andsomething uncanny going on. A philosopher: alas a being who oftenruns away from himself is often afraid of himself--but whose curiosityalways makes him come to himself again.. A man who says: I like that I take it for my own and mean toguard and protect it from every one; a man who can conduct a casecarry out a resolution remain true to an opinion keep hold of a womanpunish and overthrow insolence; a man who has his indignation and hissword and to whom the weak the suffering the oppressed and even theanimals willingly submit and naturally belong; in short a man who is aMASTER by nature--when such a man has sympathy well! THAT sympathy hasvalue! But of what account is the sympathy of those who suffer! Or ofthose even who preach sympathy! There is nowadays throughout almost thewhole of Europe a sickly irritability and sensitiveness towards painand also a repulsive irrestrainableness in complaining an effeminizingwhich with the aid of religion and philosophical nonsense seeksto deck itself out as something superior--there is a regular cult ofsuffering. The UNMANLINESS of that which is called sympathy by suchgroups of visionaries is always I believe the first thing thatstrikes the eye.--One must resolutely and radically taboo this latestform of bad taste; and finally I wish people to put the good amuletGAI SABER gay science in ordinary language on heart and neck asa protection against it.. THE OLYMPIAN VICE.--Despite the philosopher who as a genuineEnglishman tried to bring laughter into bad repute in all thinkingminds--Laughing is a bad infirmity of human nature which everythinking mind will strive to overcome Hobbes--I would evenallow myself to rank philosophers according to the quality of theirlaughing--up to those who are capable of GOLDEN laughter. And supposingthat Gods also philosophize which I am strongly inclined to believeowing to many reasons--I have no doubt that they also know how to laughthereby in an overman-like and new fashion--and at the expense of allserious things! Gods are fond of ridicule: it seems that they cannotrefrain from laughter even in holy matters.. The genius of the heart as that great mysterious one possessesit the tempter-god and born rat-catcher of consciences whose voice candescend into the nether-world of every soul who neither speaks a wordnor casts a glance in which there may not be some motive or touchof allurement to whose perfection it pertains that he knows how toappear--not as he is but in a guise which acts as an ADDITIONALconstraint on his followers to press ever closer to him to follow himmore cordially and thoroughly;--the genius of the heart which imposessilence and attention on everything loud and self-conceited whichsmoothes rough souls and makes them taste a new longing--to lie placidas a mirror that the deep heavens may be reflected in them;--the geniusof the heart which teaches the clumsy and too hasty hand to hesitateand to grasp more delicately; which scents the hidden and forgottentreasure the drop of goodness and sweet spirituality under thick darkice and is a divining-rod for every grain of gold long buried andimprisoned in mud and sand; the genius of the heart from contact withwhich every one goes away richer; not favoured or surprised not asthough gratified and oppressed by the good things of others; but richerin himself newer than before broken up blown upon and sounded by athawing wind; more uncertain perhaps more delicate more fragile morebruised but full of hopes which as yet lack names full of a new willand current full of a new ill-will and counter-current... but what am Idoing my friends Of whom am I talking to you Have I forgotten myselfso far that I have not even told you his name Unless it be that youhave already divined of your own accord who this questionable Godand spirit is that wishes to be PRAISED in such a manner For as ithappens to every one who from childhood onward has always been on hislegs and in foreign lands I have also encountered on my path manystrange and dangerous spirits; above all however and again and againthe one of whom I have just spoken: in fact no less a personage thanthe God DIONYSUS the great equivocator and tempter to whom as youknow I once offered in all secrecy and reverence my first-fruits--thelast as it seems to me who has offered a SACRIFICE to him for Ihave found no one who could understand what I was then doing. Inthe meantime however I have learned much far too much about thephilosophy of this God and as I said from mouth to mouth--I the lastdisciple and initiate of the God Dionysus: and perhaps I might at lastbegin to give you my friends as far as I am allowed a little taste ofthis philosophy In a hushed voice as is but seemly: for it has to dowith much that is secret new strange wonderful and uncanny. Thevery fact that Dionysus is a philosopher and that therefore Gods alsophilosophize seems to me a novelty which is not unensnaring and mightperhaps arouse suspicion precisely among philosophers;--among you myfriends there is less to be said against it except that it comes toolate and not at the right time; for as it has been disclosed to me youare loth nowadays to believe in God and gods. It may happen too thatin the frankness of my story I must go further than is agreeable to thestrict usages of your ears Certainly the God in question went furthervery much further in such dialogues and was always many paces ahead ofme... Indeed if it were allowed I should have to give him accordingto human usage fine ceremonious tides of lustre and merit I shouldhave to extol his courage as investigator and discoverer his fearlesshonesty truthfulness and love of wisdom. But such a God does not knowwhat to do with all that respectable trumpery and pomp. Keep that hewould say for thyself and those like thee and whoever else requireit! I--have no reason to cover my nakedness! One suspects that thiskind of divinity and philosopher perhaps lacks shame--He once said:Under certain circumstances I love mankind--and referred thereby toAriadne who was present; in my opinion man is an agreeable braveinventive animal that has not his equal upon earth he makes his wayeven through all labyrinths. I like man and often think how I canstill further advance him and make him stronger more evil and moreprofound.--Stronger more evil and more profound I asked in horror.Yes he said again stronger more evil and more profound; also morebeautiful--and thereby the tempter-god smiled with his halcyon smileas though he had just paid some charming compliment. One here sees atonce that it is not only shame that this divinity lacks;--and in generalthere are good grounds for supposing that in some things the Gods couldall of them come to us men for instruction. We men are--more human.--. Alas! what are you after all my written and painted thoughts! Notlong ago you were so variegated young and malicious so full of thornsand secret spices that you made me sneeze and laugh--and now Youhave already doffed your novelty and some of you I fear are readyto become truths so immortal do they look so pathetically honest sotedious! And was it ever otherwise What then do we write and paintwe mandarins with Chinese brush we immortalisers of things which LENDthemselves to writing what are we alone capable of painting Alas onlythat which is just about to fade and begins to lose its odour! Alasonly exhausted and departing storms and belated yellow sentiments! Alasonly birds strayed and fatigued by flight which now let themselves becaptured with the hand--with OUR hand! We immortalize what cannot liveand fly much longer things only which are exhausted and mellow! And itis only for your AFTERNOON you my written and painted thoughts forwhich alone I have colours many colours perhaps many variegatedsoftenings and fifty yellows and browns and greens and reds;--butnobody will divine thereby how ye looked in your morning you suddensparks and marvels of my solitude you my old beloved--EVIL thoughts!FROM THE HEIGHTSBy F W NietzscheTranslated by L.

The world now laughs the grisly veil was torn     And Light and Dark were one that wedding-morn.PREFACE.It is often enough and always with great surprise intimated to me thatthere is something both ordinary and unusual in all my writings fromthe Birth of Tragedy to the recently published Prelude to aPhilosophy of the Future: they all contain I have been told snaresand nets for short sighted birds and something that is almost aconstant subtle incitement to an overturning of habitual opinions andof approved customs. What! Everything is merely--human--all too humanWith this exclamation my writings are gone through not without acertain dread and mistrust of ethic itself and not without a dispositionto ask the exponent of evil things if those things be not simplymisrepresented. My writings have been termed a school of distrust stillmore of disdain: also and more happily of courage audacity even. Andin fact I myself do not believe that anybody ever looked into the worldwith a distrust as deep as mine seeming as I do not simply the timelyadvocate of the devil but to employ theological terms an enemy andchallenger of God; and whosoever has experienced any of the consequencesof such deep distrust anything of the chills and the agonies ofisolation to which such an unqualified difference of standpoint condemnshim endowed with it will also understand how often I must have soughtrelief and self-forgetfulness from any source--through any object ofveneration or enmity of scientific seriousness or wanton lightness;also why I when I could not find what I was in need of had to fashionit for myself counterfeiting it or imagining it and what poet orwriter has ever done anything else and what other purpose can all theart in the world possibly have That which I always stood most in needof in order to effect my cure and self-recovery was faith faith enoughnot to be thus isolated not to look at life from so singular a point ofview--a magic apprehension in eye and mind of relationship andequality a calm confidence in friendship a blindness free fromsuspicion and questioning to two sidedness; a pleasure in externalssuperficialities the near the accessible in all things possessed ofcolor skin and seeming. Perhaps I could be fairly reproached with muchart in this regard many fine counterfeitings; for example thatwisely or wilfully I had shut my eyes to Schopenhauers blind willtowards ethic at a time when I was already clear sighted enough on thesubject of ethic; likewise that I had deceived myself concerning RichardWagners incurable romanticism as if it were a beginning and not anend; likewise concerning the Greeks likewise concerning the Germans andtheir future--and there may be perhaps a long list of such likewises.Granted however that all this were true and with justice urgedagainst me what does it signify what can it signify in regard to howmuch of the self-sustaining capacity how much of reason and higherprotection are embraced in such self-deception--and how much morefalsity is still necessary to me that I may therewith always reassuremyself regarding the luxury of my truth. Enough I still live; and lifeis not considered now apart from ethic; it _will_ have deception; itthrives lebt on deception ... but am I not beginning to do all overagain what I have always done I the old immoralist and birdsnarer--talk unmorally ultramorally beyond good and evilThus then have I evolved for myself the free spirits to whom thisdiscouraging-encouraging work under the general title Human All TooHuman is dedicated. Such free spirits do not really exist and neverdid exist. But I stood in need of them as I have pointed out in orderthat some good might be mixed with my evils illness lonelinessstrangeness _acedia_ incapacity: to serve as gay spirits andcomrades with whom one may talk and laugh when one is disposed to talkand laugh and whom one may send to the devil when they grow wearisome.They are some compensation for the lack of friends. That such freespirits can possibly exist that our Europe will yet number among hersons of to-morrow or of the day after to-morrow such a brilliant andenthusiastic company alive and palpable and not merely as in my casefantasms and imaginary shades I myself can by no means doubt. I seethem already coming slowly slowly. May it not be that I am doing alittle something to expedite their coming when I describe in advance theinfluences under which I see them evolving and the ways along which theytravelIt may be conjectured that a soul in which the type of free spirit canattain maturity and completeness had its decisive and deciding event inthe form of a great emancipation or unbinding and that prior to thatevent it seemed only the more firmly and forever chained to its placeand pillar. What binds strongest What cords seem almost unbreakable Inthe case of mortals of a choice and lofty nature they will be those ofduty: that reverence which in youth is most typical that timidity andtenderness in the presence of the traditionally honored and the worthythat gratitude to the soil from which we sprung for the hand thatguided us for the relic before which we were taught to pray--theirsublimest moments will themselves bind these souls most strongly. Thegreat liberation comes suddenly to such prisoners like an earthquake:the young soul is all at once shaken torn apart cast forth--itcomprehends not itself what is taking place. An involuntary onwardimpulse rules them with the mastery of command; a will a wish aredeveloped to go forward anywhere at any price; a strong dangerouscuriosity regarding an undiscovered world flames and flashes in alltheir being. Better to die than live _here_--so sounds the temptingvoice: and this here this at home constitutes all they havehitherto loved. A sudden dread and distrust of that which they loved aflash of contempt for that which is called their duty a mutinouswilful volcanic-like longing for a far away journey strange scenes andpeople annihilation petrifaction a hatred surmounting love perhaps asacrilegious impulse and look backwards to where they so long prayedand loved perhaps a flush of shame for what they did and at the sametime an exultation at having done it an inner intoxicatingdelightful tremor in which is betrayed the sense of victory--a victoryover what over whom a riddle-like victory fruitful in questioning andwell worth questioning but the _first_ victory for all--such things ofpain and ill belong to the history of the great liberation. And it is atthe same time a malady that can destroy a man this first outbreak ofstrength and will for self-destination self-valuation this will forfree will: and how much illness is forced to the surface in the franticstrivings and singularities with which the freedman the liberated seekshenceforth to attest his mastery over things! He roves fiercely aroundwith an unsatisfied longing and whatever objects he may encounter mustsuffer from the perilous expectancy of his pride; he tears to pieceswhatever attracts him. With a sardonic laugh he overturns whatever hefinds veiled or protected by any reverential awe: he would see whatthese things look like when they are overturned. It is wilfulness anddelight in the wilfulness of it if he now perhaps gives his approvalto that which has heretofore been in ill repute--if in curiosity andexperiment he penetrates stealthily to the most forbidden things. Inthe background during all his plunging and roaming--for he is asrestless and aimless in his course as if lost in a wilderness--is theinterrogation mark of a curiosity growing ever more dangerous. Can wenot upset every standard and is good perhaps evil and God only aninvention and a subtlety of the devil Is everything in the lastresort false And if we are dupes are we not on that very accountdupers also _must_ we not be dupers also Such reflections lead andmislead him ever further on ever further away. Solitude that dreadgoddess and mater saeva cupidinum encircles and besets him ever morethreatening more violent more heart breaking--but who to-day knowswhat solitude isFrom this morbid solitude from the deserts of such trial years the wayis yet far to that great overflowing certainty and healthiness whichcannot dispense even with sickness as a means and a grappling hook ofknowledge; to that matured freedom of the spirit which is in an equaldegree self mastery and discipline of the heart and gives access tothe path of much and various reflection--to that inner comprehensivenessand self satisfaction of over-richness which precludes all danger thatthe spirit has gone astray even in its own path and is sittingintoxicated in some corner or other; to that overplus of plastichealing imitative and restorative power which is the very sign ofvigorous health that overplus which confers upon the free spirit theperilous prerogative of spending a life in experiment and of runningadventurous risks: the past-master-privilege of the free spirit. In theinterval there may be long years of convalescence years filled withmany hued painfully-bewitching transformations dominated and led to thegoal by a tenacious will for health that is often emboldened to assumethe guise and the disguise of health. There is a middle ground to thiswhich a man of such destiny can not subsequently recall without emotion;he basks in a special fine sun of his own with a feeling of birdlikefreedom birdlike visual power birdlike irrepressibleness a somethingextraneous Drittes in which curiosity and delicate disdain haveunited. A free spirit--this refreshing term is grateful in any moodit almost sets one aglow. One lives--no longer in the bonds of love andhate without a yes or no here or there indifferently best pleased toevade to avoid to beat about neither advancing nor retreating. One ishabituated to the bad like a person who all at once sees a fearfulhurly-burly _beneath_ him--and one was the counterpart of him whobothers himself with things that do not concern him. As a matter of factthe free spirit is bothered with mere things--and how manythings--which no longer _concern_ him.A step further in recovery: and the free spirit draws near to lifeagain slowly indeed almost refractorily almost distrustfully. Thereis again warmth and mellowness: feeling and fellow feeling acquiredepth lambent airs stir all about him. He almost feels: it seems as ifnow for the first time his eyes are open to things _near_. He is inamaze and sits hushed: for where had he been These near and immediatethings: how changed they seem to him! He looks gratefully back--gratefulfor his wandering his self exile and severity his lookings afar andhis bird flights in the cold heights. How fortunate that he has notlike a sensitive dull home body remained always in the house and athome! He had been beside himself beyond a doubt. Now for the firsttime he really sees himself--and what surprises in the process. Whathitherto unfelt tremors! Yet what joy in the exhaustion the oldsickness the relapses of the convalescent! How it delights himsuffering to sit still to exercise patience to lie in the sun! Who sowell as he appreciates the fact that there comes balmy weather even inwinter who delights more in the sunshine athwart the wall They arethe most appreciative creatures in the world and also the most humblethese convalescents and lizards crawling back towards life: there aresome among them who can let no day slip past them without addressingsome song of praise to its retreating light. And speaking seriously itis a fundamental cure for all pessimism the cankerous vice as is wellknown of all idealists and humbugs to become ill in the manner ofthese free spirits to remain ill quite a while and then bit by bit growhealthy--I mean healthier. It is wisdom worldly wisdom to administereven health to oneself for a long time in small doses.About this time it becomes at last possible amid the flash lights of astill unestablished still precarious health for the free the everfreer spirit to begin to read the riddle of that great liberation ariddle which has hitherto lingered obscure well worth questioningalmost impalpable in his memory. If once he hardly dared to ask why soapart so alone renouncing all I loved renouncing respect itself whythis coldness this suspicion this hate for ones very virtues--nowhe dares and asks it loudly already hearing the answer you had tobecome master over yourself master of your own good qualities. Formerlythey were your masters: but they should be merely your tools along withother tools. You had to acquire power over your aye and no and learn tohold and withhold them in accordance with your higher aims. You had tograsp the perspective of every representation WerthschÃ¤tzung--thedislocation distortion and the apparent end or teleology of thehorizon besides whatever else appertains to the perspective: also theelement of demerit in its relation to opposing merit and the wholeintellectual cost of every affirmative every negative. You had to findout the _inevitable_ error in every Yes and in every No error asinseparable from life life itself as conditioned by the perspective andits inaccuracy. Above all you had to see with your own eyes wherethe error is always greatest: there namely where life is littlestnarrowest meanest least developed and yet cannot help looking uponitself as the goal and standard of things and smugly and ignobly andincessantly tearing to tatters all that is highest and greatest andrichest and putting the shreds into the form of questions from thestandpoint of its own well being. You had to see with your own eyes theproblem of classification Rangordnung regulation concerning rank andstation and how strength and sweep and reach of perspective wax upwardtogether: You had--enough the free spirit knows henceforward whichyou had it has obeyed and also what it now can do and what it now forthe first time _dare_. Ungerechtigkeit literally wrongfulness injustice unrighteousness.Accordingly the free spirit works out for itself an answer to thatriddle of its liberation and concludes by generalizing upon itsexperience in the following fashion: What I went through everyone mustgo through in whom any problem is germinated and strives to body itselfforth. The inner power and inevitability of this problem will assertthemselves in due course as in the case of any unsuspectedpregnancy--long before the spirit has seen this problem in its trueaspect and learned to call it by its right name. Our destiny exercisesits influence over us even when as yet we have not learned its nature:it is our future that lays down the law to our to-day. Granted that itis the problem of classification of which we free spirits may saythis is _our_ problem yet it is only now in the midday of our lifethat we fully appreciate what preparations shifts trials ordealsstages were essential to that problem before it could emerge to ourview and why we had to go through the various and contradictorylongings and satisfactions of body and soul as circumnavigators andadventurers of that inner world called man; as surveyors of thathigher and of that progression that is also calledman--crowding in everywhere almost without fear disdaining nothingmissing nothing testing everything sifting everything and eliminatingthe chance impurities--until at last we could say we free spirits:Here--a _new_ problem! Here a long ladder on the rungs of which weourselves have rested and risen which we have actually been at times.Here is a something higher a something deeper a something below us avastly extensive order Ordnung a comparative classificationRangordnung that we perceive: here--_our_ problem! Rangordnung: the meaning is the problem of grasping the relativeimportance of things. Uebereinander: one over another.To what stage in the development just outlined the present book belongsor is assigned is something that will be hidden from no augur orpsychologist for an instant. But where are there psychologists to-dayIn France certainly; in Russia perhaps; certainly not in Germany.Grounds are not wanting to be sure upon which the Germans of to-daymay adduce this fact to their credit: unhappily for one who in thismatter is fashioned and mentored in an un-German school! This _German_book which has found its readers in a wide circle of lands andpeoples--it has been some ten years on its rounds--and which must makeits way by means of any musical art and tune that will captivate theforeign ear as well as the native--this book has been read mostindifferently in Germany itself and little heeded there: to what is thatdue It requires too much I have been told it addresses itself tomen free from the press of petty obligations it demands fine andtrained perceptions it requires a surplus a surplus of time of thelightness of heaven and of the heart of otium in the most unrestrictedsense: mere good things that we Germans of to-day have not got andtherefore cannot give. After so graceful a retort my philosophy bidsme be silent and ask no more questions: at times as the proverb saysone remains a philosopher only because one says--nothing!Nice Spring .OF THE FIRST AND LAST THINGS.=Chemistry of the Notions and the Feelings.=--Philosophical problems inalmost all their aspects present themselves in the same interrogativeformula now that they did two thousand years ago: how can a thingdevelop out of its antithesis for example the reasonable from thenon-reasonable the animate from the inanimate the logical from theillogical altruism from egoism disinterestedness from greed truthfrom error The metaphysical philosophy formerly steered itself clear ofthis difficulty to such extent as to repudiate the evolution of onething from another and to assign a miraculous origin to what it deemedhighest and best due to the very nature and being of thething-in-itself. The historical philosophy on the other hand whichcan no longer be viewed apart from physical science the youngest of allphilosophical methods discovered experimentally and its results willprobably always be the same that there is no antithesis whateverexcept in the usual exaggerations of popular or metaphysicalcomprehension and that an error of the reason is at the bottom of suchcontradiction. According to its explanation there is strictlyspeaking neither unselfish conduct nor a wholly disinterested point ofview. Both are simply sublimations in which the basic element seemsalmost evaporated and betrays its presence only to the keenestobservation. All that we need and that could possibly be given us in thepresent state of development of the sciences is a chemistry of themoral religious aesthetic conceptions and feeling as well as of thoseemotions which we experience in the affairs great and small of societyand civilization and which we are sensible of even in solitude. Butwhat if this chemistry established the fact that even in _its_ domainthe most magnificent results were attained with the basest and mostdespised ingredients Would many feel disposed to continue suchinvestigations Mankind loves to put by the questions of its origin andbeginning: must one not be almost inhuman in order to follow theopposite course=The Traditional Error of Philosophers.=--All philosophers make thecommon mistake of taking contemporary man as their starting point and oftrying through an analysis of him to reach a conclusion. Maninvoluntarily presents himself to them as an aeterna veritas as apassive element in every hurly-burly as a fixed standard of things. Yeteverything uttered by the philosopher on the subject of man is in thelast resort nothing more than a piece of testimony concerning manduring a very limited period of time. Lack of the historical sense isthe traditional defect in all philosophers. Many innocently take man inhis most childish state as fashioned through the influence of certainreligious and even of certain political developments as the permanentform under which man must be viewed. They will not learn that man hasevolved that the intellectual faculty itself is an evolutionwhereas some philosophers make the whole cosmos out of this intellectualfaculty. But everything essential in human evolution took place aeonsago long before the four thousand years or so of which we knowanything: during these man may not have changed very much. However thephilosopher ascribes instinct to contemporary man and assumes thatthis is one of the unalterable facts regarding man himself and henceaffords a clue to the understanding of the universe in general. Thewhole teleology is so planned that man during the last four thousandyears shall be spoken of as a being existing from all eternity andwith reference to whom everything in the cosmos from its very inceptionis naturally ordered. Yet everything evolved: there are no eternal factsas there are no absolute truths. Accordingly historical philosophisingis henceforth indispensable and with it honesty of judgment. geworden.=Appreciation of Simple Truths.=--It is the characteristic of anadvanced civilization to set a higher value upon little simple truthsascertained by scientific method than upon the pleasing and magnificenterrors originating in metaphysical and Ã¦sthetical epochs and peoples. Tobegin with the former are spoken of with contempt as if there could beno question of comparison respecting them so rigid homely prosaic andeven discouraging is the aspect of the first while so beautifuldecorative intoxicating and perhaps beatific appear the last named.Nevertheless the hardwon the certain the lasting and therefore thefertile in new knowledge is the higher; to hold fast to it is manly andevinces courage directness endurance. And not only individual men butall mankind will by degrees be uplifted to this manliness when they arefinally habituated to the proper appreciation of tenable enduringknowledge and have lost all faith in inspiration and in the miraculousrevelation of truth. The reverers of forms indeed with their standardsof beauty and taste may have good reason to laugh when the appreciationof little truths and the scientific spirit begin to prevail but thatwill be only because their eyes are not yet opened to the charm of theutmost simplicity of form or because men though reared in the rightlyappreciative spirit will still not be fully permeated by it so thatthey continue unwittingly imitating ancient forms and that ill enoughas anybody does who no longer feels any interest in a thing. Formerlythe mind was not brought into play through the medium of exact thought.Its serious business lay in the working out of forms and symbols. Thathas now changed. Any seriousness in symbolism is at present theindication of a deficient education. As our very acts become moreintellectual our tendencies more rational and our judgment forexample as to what seems reasonable is very different from what it wasa hundred years ago: so the forms of our lives grow ever moreintellectual and to the old fashioned eye perhaps uglier but onlybecause it cannot see that the richness of inner rational beauty alwaysspreads and deepens and that the inner rational aspect of all thingsshould now be of more consequence to us than the most beautifulexternality and the most exquisite limning.=Astrology and the Like.=--It is presumable that the objects of thereligious moral aesthetic and logical notions pertain simply to thesuperficialities of things although man flatters himself with thethought that here at least he is getting to the heart of the cosmos. Hedeceives himself because these things have power to make him so happyand so wretched and so he evinces in this respect the same conceitthat characterises astrology. Astrology presupposes that the heavenlybodies are regulated in their movements in harmony with the destiny ofmortals: the moral man presupposes that that which concerns himself mostnearly must also be the heart and soul of things.=Misconception of Dreams.=--In the dream mankind in epochs of crudeprimitive civilization thought they were introduced to a secondsubstantial world: here we have the source of all metaphysic. Withoutthe dream men would never have been incited to an analysis of theworld. Even the distinction between soul and body is wholly due to theprimitive conception of the dream as also the hypothesis of theembodied soul whence the development of all superstition and alsoprobably the belief in god. The dead still live: for they appear tothe living in dreams. So reasoned mankind at one time and through manythousands of years.=The Scientific Spirit Prevails only Partially not Wholly.=--Thespecialized minutest departments of science are dealt with purelyobjectively. But the general universal sciences considered as a greatbasic unity posit the question--truly a very living question--: to whatpurpose what is the use Because of this reference to utility they areas a whole less impersonal than when looked at in their specializedaspects. Now in the case of philosophy as forming the apex of thescientific pyramid this question of the utility of knowledge isnecessarily brought very conspicuously forward so that every philosophyhas unconsciously the air of ascribing the highest utility to itself.It is for this reason that all philosophies contain such a great amountof high flying metaphysic and such a shrinking from the seeminginsignificance of the deliverances of physical science: for thesignificance of knowledge in relation to life must be made to appear asgreat as possible. This constitutes the antagonism between thespecialties of science and philosophy. The latter aims as art aims atimparting to life and conduct the utmost depth and significance: in theformer mere knowledge is sought and nothing else--whatever else beincidentally obtained. Heretofore there has never been a philosophicalsystem in which philosophy itself was not made the apologist ofknowledge in the abstract. On this point at least each is optimisticand insists that to knowledge the highest utility must be ascribed. Theyare all under the tyranny of logic which is from its very natureoptimism.=The Discordant Element in Science.=--Philosophy severed itself fromscience when it put the question: what is that knowledge of the worldand of life through which mankind may be made happiest This happenedwhen the Socratic school arose: with the standpoint of _happiness_ thearteries of investigating science were compressed too tightly to permitof any circulation of the blood--and are so compressed to-day.=Pneumatic Explanation of Nature.=--Metaphysic reads the message ofnature as if it were written purely pneumatically as the church and itslearned ones formerly did where the bible was concerned. It requires agreat deal of expertness to apply to nature the same strict science ofinterpretation that the philologists have devised for all literatureand to apply it for the purpose of a simple direct interpretation ofthe message and at the same time not bring out a double meaning. Butas in the case of books and literature errors of exposition are farfrom being completely eliminated and vestiges of allegorical andmystical interpretations are still to be met with in the most cultivatedcircles so where nature is concerned the case is--actually much worse. Pneumatic is here used in the sense of spiritual. Pneuma being theGreek word in the New Testament for the Holy Spirit.--Ed.=Metaphysical World.=--It is true there may be a metaphysical world;the absolute possibility of it can scarcely be disputed. We see allthings through the medium of the human head and we cannot well cut offthis head: although there remains the question what part of the worldwould be left after it had been cut off. But that is a purely abstractscientific problem and one not much calculated to give men uneasiness:yet everything that has heretofore made metaphysical assumptionsvaluable fearful or delightful to men all that gave rise to them ispassion error and self deception: the worst systems of knowledge notthe best pin their tenets of belief thereto. When such methods are oncebrought to view as the basis of all existing religions and metaphysicsthey are already discredited. There always remains however thepossibility already conceded: but nothing at all can be made out ofthat to say not a word about letting happiness salvation and life hangupon the threads spun from such a possibility. Accordingly nothingcould be predicated of the metaphysical world beyond the fact that it isan elsewhere another sphere inaccessible and incomprehensible tous: it would become a thing of negative properties. Even were theexistence of such a world absolutely established it would neverthelessremain incontrovertible that of all kinds of knowledge knowledge ofsuch a world would be of least consequence--of even less consequencethan knowledge of the chemical analysis of water would be to a stormtossed mariner. Anderssein.=The Harmlessness of Metaphysic in the Future.=--As soon as religionart and ethics are so understood that a full comprehension of them canbe gained without taking refuge in the postulates of metaphysicalclaptrap at any point in the line of reasoning there will be a completecessation of interest in the purely theoretical problem of the thing initself and the phenomenon. For here too the same truth applies: inreligion art and ethics we are not concerned with the essence of thecosmos. We are in the sphere of pure conception. No presentiment orintuition can carry us any further. With perfect tranquility thequestion of how our conception of the world could differ so sharply fromthe actual world as it is manifest to us will be relegated to thephysiological sciences and to the history of the evolution of ideas andorganisms. Wesen der Welt an sich.=Language as a Presumptive Science.=--The importance of language in thedevelopment of civilization consists in the fact that by means of itman placed one world his own alongside another a place of leveragethat he thought so firm as to admit of his turning the rest of thecosmos on a pivot that he might master it. In so far as man for ageslooked upon mere ideas and names of things as upon aeternae veritateshe evinced the very pride with which he raised himself above the brute.He really supposed that in language he possessed a knowledge of thecosmos. The language builder was not so modest as to believe that he wasonly giving names to things. On the contrary he thought he embodied thehighest wisdom concerning things in mere words; and in truthlanguage is the first movement in all strivings for wisdom. Here tooit is _faith in ascertained truth_ from which the mightiest fountainsof strength have flowed. Very tardily--only now--it dawns upon men thatthey have propagated a monstrous error in their belief in language.Fortunately it is too late now to arrest and turn back the evolutionaryprocess of the reason which had its inception in this belief. Logicitself rests upon assumptions to which nothing in the world of realitycorresponds. For example the correspondence of certain things to oneanother and the identity of those things at different periods of timeare assumptions pure and simple but the science of logic originated inthe positive belief that they were not assumptions at all butestablished facts. It is the same with the science of mathematics whichcertainly would never have come into existence if mankind had known fromthe beginning that in all nature there is no perfectly straight line notrue circle no standard of measurement. Glaube an die gefundene Wahrheit as distinguished from faith inwhat is taken on trust as truth.=Dream and Civilization.=--The function of the brain which is mostencroached upon in slumber is the memory; not that it is whollysuspended but it is reduced to a state of imperfection as in primitiveages of mankind was probably the case with everyone whether waking orsleeping. Uncontrolled and entangled as it is it perpetually confusesthings as a result of the most trifling similarities yet in the samemental confusion and lack of control the nations invented theirmythologies while nowadays travelers habitually observe how prone thesavage is to forgetfulness how his mind after the least exertion ofmemory begins to wander and lose itself until finally he uttersfalsehood and nonsense from sheer exhaustion. Yet in dreams we allresemble this savage. Inadequacy of distinction and error of comparisonare the basis of the preposterous things we do and say in dreams sothat when we clearly recall a dream we are startled that so much idiocylurks within us. The absolute distinctness of all dream-images due toimplicit faith in their substantial reality recalls the conditions inwhich earlier mankind were placed for whom hallucinations hadextraordinary vividness entire communities and even entire nationslaboring simultaneously under them. Therefore: in sleep and in dream wemake the pilgrimage of early mankind over again.=Logic of the Dream.=--During sleep the nervous system through variousinner provocatives is in constant agitation. Almost all the organs actindependently and vigorously. The blood circulates rapidly. The postureof the sleeper compresses some portions of the body. The coverletsinfluence the sensations in different ways. The stomach carries on thedigestive process and acts upon other organs thereby. The intestines arein motion. The position of the head induces unaccustomed action. Thefeet shoeless no longer pressing the ground are the occasion of othersensations of novelty as is indeed the changed garb of the entirebody. All these things following the bustle and change of the dayresult through their novelty in a movement throughout the entiresystem that extends even to the brain functions. Thus there are ahundred circumstances to induce perplexity in the mind a questioning asto the cause of this excitation. Now the dream is a _seeking andpresenting of reasons_ for these excitations of feeling of the supposedreasons that is to say. Thus for example whoever has his feet boundwith two threads will probably dream that a pair of serpents are coiledabout his feet. This is at first a hypothesis then a belief with anaccompanying imaginative picture and the argument: these snakes must bethe _causa_ of those sensations which I the sleeper now have. Soreasons the mind of the sleeper. The conditions precedent as thusconjectured become owing to the excitation of the fancy presentrealities. Everyone knows from experience how a dreamer will transformone piercing sound for example that of a bell into another of quite adifferent nature say the report of cannon. In his dream he becomesaware first of the effects which he explains by a subsequent hypothesisand becomes persuaded of the purely conjectural nature of the sound. Buthow comes it that the mind of the dreamer goes so far astray when thesame mind awake is habitually cautious careful and so conservativein its dealings with hypotheses why does the first plausiblehypothesis of the cause of a sensation gain credit in the dreamingstate For in a dream we look upon that dream as reality that is weaccept our hypotheses as fully established. I have no doubt that as menargue in their dreams to-day mankind argued even in their wakingmoments for thousands of years: the first _causa_ that occurred to themind with reference to anything that stood in need of explanation wasaccepted as the true explanation and served as such. Savages show thesame tendency in operation as the reports of travelers agree. In thedream this atavistic relic of humanity manifests its existence withinus for it is the foundation upon which the higher rational facultydeveloped itself and still develops itself in every individual. Dreamscarry us back to the earlier stages of human culture and afford us ameans of understanding it more clearly. Dream thought comes so easily tous now because we are so thoroughly trained to it through theinterminable stages of evolution during which this fanciful and facileform of theorising has prevailed. To a certain extent the dream is arestorative for the brain which during the day is called upon to meetthe many demands for trained thought made upon it by the conditions of ahigher civilization.--We may if we please become sensible even in ourwaking moments of a condition that is as a door and vestibule todreaming. If we close our eyes the brain immediately conjures up amedley of impressions of light and color apparently a sort of imitationand echo of the impressions forced in upon the brain during its wakingmoments. And now the mind in co-operation with the imaginationtransforms this formless play of light and color into definite figuresmoving groups landscapes. What really takes place is a sort ofreasoning from effect back to cause. As the brain inquires: whence theseimpressions of light and color it posits as the inducing causes of suchlights and colors those shapes and figures. They serve the brain as theoccasions of those lights and colors because the brain when the eyesare open and the senses awake is accustomed to perceiving the cause ofevery impression of light and color made upon it. Here again theimagination is continually interposing its images inasmuch as itparticipates in the production of the impressions made through thesenses day by day: and the dream-fancy does exactly the same thing--thatis the presumed cause is determined from the effect and _after_ theeffect: all this too with extraordinary rapidity so that in thismatter as in a matter of jugglery or sleight-of-hand a confusion ofthe mind is produced and an after effect is made to appear asimultaneous action an inverted succession of events even.--Fromthese considerations we can see how _late_ strict logical thought thetrue notion of cause and effect must have been in developing since ourintellectual and rational faculties to this very day revert to theseprimitive processes of deduction while practically half our lifetime isspent in the super-inducing conditions.--Even the poet the artistascribes to his sentimental and emotional states causes which are notthe true ones. To that extent he is a reminder of early mankind and canaid us in its comprehension.=Association.=--All strong feelings are associated with a variety ofallied sentiments and emotions. They stir up the memory at the sametime. When we are under their influence we are reminded of similarstates and we feel a renewal of them within us. Thus are formed habitualsuccessions of feelings and notions which at last when they followone another with lightning rapidity are no longer felt as complexitiesbut as unities. In this sense we hear of moral feelings of religiousfeelings as if they were absolute unities. In reality they are streamswith a hundred sources and tributaries. Here again the unity of theword speaks nothing for the unity of the thing. Miterklingen: to sound simultaneously with.=No Within and Without in the World.=--As Democritus transferred thenotions above and below to limitless space where they are destitute ofmeaning so the philosophers do generally with the idea within andwithout as regards the form and substance Wesen und Erscheinung ofthe world. What they claim is that through the medium of profoundfeelings one can penetrate deep into the soul of things Innre drawclose to the heart of nature. But these feelings are deep only in so faras with them are simultaneously aroused although almost imperceptiblycertain complicated groups of thoughts Gedankengruppen which we calldeep: a feeling is deep because we deem the thoughts accompanying itdeep. But deep thought can nevertheless be very widely sundered fromtruth as for instance every metaphysical thought. Take from deepfeeling the element of thought blended with it and all that remains is_strength_ of feeling which is no voucher for the validity ofknowledge as intense faith is evidence only of its own intensity andnot of the truth of that in which the faith is felt. Kein Innen und Aussen in der Welt: the above translation may seemtoo literal but some dispute has arisen concerning the precise idea theauthor means to convey.=Phenomenon and Thing-in-Itself.=--The philosophers are in the habit ofplacing themselves in front of life and experience--that which they callthe world of phenomena--as if they were standing before a picture thatis unrolled before them in its final completeness. This panorama theythink must be studied in every detail in order to reach some conclusionregarding the object represented by the picture. From effectaccordingly is deduced cause and from cause is deduced theunconditioned. This process is generally looked upon as affording theall sufficient explanation of the world of phenomena. On the other handone must while putting the conception of the metaphysical distinctlyforward as that of the unconditioned and consequently of theunconditioning absolutely deny any connection between the unconditionedof the metaphysical world and the world known to us: so thatthroughout phenomena there is no manifestation of the thing-in-itselfand getting from one to the other is out of the question. Thus is leftquite ignored the circumstance that the picture--that which we now calllife and experience--is a gradual evolution is indeed still inprocess of evolution and for that reason should not be regarded as anenduring whole from which any conclusion as to its author theall-sufficient reason could be arrived at or even pronounced out ofthe question. It is because we have for thousands of years looked intothe world with moral aesthetic religious predispositions with blindprejudice passion or fear and surfeited ourselves with indulgence inthe follies of illogical thought that the world has gradually become sowondrously motley frightful significant soulful: it has taken ontints but we have been the colorists: the human intellect upon thefoundation of human needs of human passions has reared all thesephenomena and injected its own erroneous fundamental conceptions intothings. Late very late the human intellect checks itself: and now theworld of experience and the thing-in-itself seem to it so severed and soantithetical that it denies the possibility of ones hinging upon theother--or else summons us to surrender our intellect our personal willto the secret and the awe-inspiring in order that thereby we may attaincertainty of certainty hereafter. Again there are those who havecombined all the characteristic features of our world ofphenomena--that is the conception of the world which has been formedand inherited through a series of intellectual vagaries--and instead ofholding the intellect responsible for it all have pronounced the verynature of things accountable for the present very sinister aspect of theworld and preached annihilation of existence. Through all these viewsand opinions the toilsome steady process of science which now for thefirst time begins to celebrate its greatest triumph in the genesis ofthought will definitely work itself out the result being perhaps tothe following effect: That which we now call the world is the result ofa crowd of errors and fancies which gradually developed in the generalevolution of organic nature have grown together and been transmitted tous as the accumulated treasure of all the past--as the _treasure_ forwhatever is worth anything in our humanity rests upon it. From thisworld of conception it is in the power of science to release us only toa slight extent--and this is all that could be wished--inasmuch as itcannot eradicate the influence of hereditary habits of feeling but itcan light up by degrees the stages of the development of that world ofconception and lift us at least for a time above the whole spectacle.Perhaps we may then perceive that the thing-in-itself is a meet subjectfor Homeric laughter: that it seemed so much everything indeed andis really a void--void that is to say of meaning.=Metaphysical Explanation.=--Man when he is young prizes metaphysicalexplanations because they make him see matters of the highest import inthings he found disagreeable or contemptible: and if he is not satisfiedwith himself this feeling of dissatisfaction is soothed when he seesthe most hidden world-problem or world-pain in that which he finds sodispleasing in himself. To feel himself more unresponsible and at thesame time to find things Dinge more interesting--that is to him thedouble benefit he owes to metaphysics. Later indeed he acquiresdistrust of the whole metaphysical method of explaining things: he thenperceives perhaps that those effects could have been attained just aswell and more scientifically by another method: that physical andhistorical explanations would at least have given that feeling offreedom from personal responsibility just as well while interest inlife and its problems would be stimulated perhaps even more.=The Fundamental Problems of Metaphysics.=--If a history of thedevelopment of thought is ever written the following propositionadvanced by a distinguished logician will be illuminated with a newlight: The universal primordial law of the apprehending subjectconsists in the inner necessity of cognizing every object by itself asin its essence a thing unto itself therefore as self-existing andunchanging in short as a substance. Even this law which is herecalled primordial is an evolution: it has yet to be shown howgradually this evolution takes place in lower organizations: how thedim mole eyes of such organizations see at first nothing but a blanksameness: how later when the various excitations of desire and aversionmanifest themselves various substances are gradually distinguished buteach with an attribute that is a special relationship to such anorganization. The first step towards the logical is judgment theessence of which according to the best logicians is belief. At thefoundation of all beliefs lie sensations of pleasure or pain in relationto the apprehending subject. A third feeling as the result of twoprior single separate feelings is judgment in its crudest form. Weorganic beings are primordially interested by nothing whatever in anything Ding except its relation to ourselves with reference to pleasureand pain. Between the moments in which we are conscious of thisrelation the states of feeling lie the moments of rest ofnot-feeling: then the world and every thing Ding have no interest forus: we observe no change in them as at present a person absorbed insomething does not notice anyone passing by. To plants all things areas a rule at rest eternal every object like itself. From the periodof lower organisms has been handed down to man the belief that there arelike things gleiche Dinge: only the trained experience attainedthrough the most advanced science contradicts this postulate. Theprimordial belief of all organisms is perhaps that all the rest of theworld is one thing and motionless.--Furthest away from this first steptowards the logical is the notion of causation: even to-day we thinkthat all our feelings and doings are at bottom acts of the free will;when the sentient individual contemplates himself he deems everyfeeling every change a something isolated disconnected that is tosay unqualified by any thing; it comes suddenly to the surfaceindependent of anything that went before or came after. We are hungrybut originally we do not know that the organism must be nourished: onthe contrary that feeling seems to manifest itself without reason orpurpose; it stands out by itself and seems quite independent. Therefore:the belief in the freedom of the will is a primordial error ofeverything organic as old as the very earliest inward prompting of thelogical faculty; belief in unconditioned substances and in like thingsgleiche Dinge is also a primordial and equally ancient error ofeverything organic. Inasmuch as all metaphysic has concerned itselfparticularly with substance and with freedom of the will it should bedesignated as the science that deals with the fundamental errors ofmankind as if they were fundamental truths.=Number.=--The invention of the laws of number has as its basis theprimordial and prior-prevailing delusion that many like things existalthough in point of fact there is no such thing is a duplicate orthat at least there are things but there is no thing. Theassumption of plurality always presupposes that _something_ exists whichmanifests itself repeatedly but just here is where the delusionprevails; in this very matter we feign realities unities that have noexistence. Our feelings notions of space and time are false for theylead when duly tested to logical contradictions. In all scientificdemonstrations we always unavoidably base our calculation upon somefalse standards of duration or measurement but as these standards areat least _constant_ as for example our notions of time and space theresults arrived at by science possess absolute accuracy and certainty intheir relationship to one another: one can keep on building uponthem--until is reached that final limit at which the erroneousfundamental conceptions the invariable breakdown come into conflictwith the results established--as for example in the case of the atomictheory. Here we always find ourselves obliged to give credence to athing or material substratum that is set in motion although at thesame time the whole scientific programme has had as its aim theresolving of everything material into motions themselves: here againwe distinguish with our feeling that which does the moving and thatwhich is moved and we never get out of this circle because thebelief in things has been from time immemorial rooted in ournature.--When Kant says the intellect does not derive its laws fromnature but dictates them to her he states the full truth as regardsthe _idea of nature_ which we form nature = world as notion that isas error but which is merely the synthesis of a host of errors of theintellect. To a world not the outcome of our conception the laws ofnumber are wholly inapplicable: such laws are valid only in the world ofmankind. Wir scheiden auch hier noch mit unserer Empfindung Bewegendes undBewegtes. Glaube an Dinge.=Some Backward Steps.=--One very forward step in education is taken whenman emerges from his superstitious and religious ideas and fears andfor instance no longer believes in the dear little angels or inoriginal sin and has stopped talking about the salvation of the soul:when he has taken this step to freedom he has nevertheless through theutmost exertion of his mental power to overcome metaphysics. Then abackward movement is necessary: he must appreciate the historicaljustification and to an equal extent the psychological considerationsin such a movement. He must understand that the greatest advances madeby mankind have resulted from such a course and that without this verybackward movement the highest achievements of man hitherto would havebeen impossible.--With regard to philosophical metaphysics I see evermore and more who have arrived at the negative goal that all positivemetaphysic is a delusion but as yet very few who go a few stepsbackward: one should look out over the last rungs of the ladder but nottry to stand on them that is to say. The most advanced as yet go onlyfar enough to free themselves from metaphysic and look back at it withan air of superiority: whereas here no less than in the hippodrome itis necessary to turn around in order to reach the end of the course.=Presumable Nature of the Victory of Doubt.=--Let us assume for amoment the validity of the skeptical standpoint: granted that there isno metaphysical world and that all the metaphysical explanations of theonly world we know are useless to us how would we then contemplate menand things Menschen und Dinge. This can be thought out and it isworth while doing so even if the question whether anything metaphysicalhas ever been demonstrated by or through Kant and Schopenhauer be putaltogether aside. For it is to all appearances highly probable thatmen on this point will be in the mass skeptical. The question thusbecomes: what sort of a notion will human society under the influenceof such a state of mind form of itself Perhaps the _scientificdemonstration_ of any metaphysical world is now so difficult thatmankind will never be free from a distrust of it. And when there isformed a feeling of distrust of metaphysics the results are in themass the same as if metaphysics were refuted altogether and _could_ nolonger be believed. In both cases the historical question with regardto an unmetaphysical disposition in mankind remains the same.=Disbelief in the monumentum aere perennius.=--A decideddisadvantage attending the termination of metaphysical modes ofthought is that the individual fixes his mind too attentively upon hisown brief lifetime and feels no strong inducement to aid in thefoundation of institutions capable of enduring for centuries: he wisheshimself to gather the fruit from the tree that he plants andconsequently he no longer plants those trees which require centuries ofconstant cultivation and are destined to afford shade to generationafter generation in the future. For metaphysical views inspire thebelief that in them is afforded the final sure foundation upon whichhenceforth the whole future of mankind may rest and be built up: theindividual promotes his own salvation; when for example he builds achurch or a monastery he is of opinion that he is doing something forthe salvation of his immortal soul:--Can science as well inspire suchfaith in the efficacy of her results In actual fact science requiresdoubt and distrust as her surest auxiliaries; nevertheless the sum ofthe irresistible that is all the onslaughts of skepticism all thedisintegrating effects of surviving truths can easily become so greatas for instance in the case of hygienic science as to inspire thedetermination to build eternal works upon it. At present the contrastbetween our excitated ephemeral existence and the tranquil repose ofmetaphysical epochs is too great because both are as yet in too closejuxtaposition. The individual man himself now goes through too manystages of inner and outer evolution for him to venture to make a planeven for his life time alone. A perfectly modern man indeed who wantsto build himself a house feels as if he were walling himself up alive ina mausoleum. Monument more enduring than brass: Horace Odes III:XXX.=Age of Comparison.=--The less men are bound by tradition the greateris the inner activity of motives the greater correspondingly theouter restlessness the promiscuous flow of humanity the polyphony ofstrivings. Who now feels any great impulse to establish himself and hisposterity in a particular place For whom moreover does there existat present any strong tie As all the methods of the arts were copiedfrom one another so were all the methods and advancements of moralcodes of manners of civilizations.--Such an age derives itssignificance from the fact that in it the various ideas codes mannersand civilizations can be compared and experienced side by side; whichwas impossible at an earlier period in view of the localised nature ofthe rule of every civilization corresponding to the limitation of allartistic effects by time and place. To-day the growth of the aestheticfeeling is decided owing to the great number of artistic forms whichoffer themselves for comparison. The majority--those that are condemnedby the method of comparison--will be allowed to die out. In the same waythere is to-day taking place a selection of the forms and customs of thehigher morality which can result only in the extinction of the vulgarmoralities. This is the age of comparison! That is its glory--but alsoits pain. Let us not however shrink from this pain. Rather would wecomprehend the nature of the task imposed upon us by our age asadequately as we can: posterity will bless us for doing so--a posteritythat knows itself to be developed through and above the narrow earlyrace-civilizations as well as the culture-civilization of comparisonbut yet looks gratefully back upon both as venerable monuments ofantiquity.=Possibility of Progress.=--When a master of the old civilization denalten Cultur vows to hold no more discussion with men who believe inprogress he is quite right. For the old civilization has itsgreatness and its advantages behind it and historic training forces oneto acknowledge that it can never again acquire vigor: only intolerablestupidity or equally intolerable fanaticism could fail to perceive thisfact. But men may consciously determine to evolve to a new civilizationwhere formerly they evolved unconsciously and accidentally. They can nowdevise better conditions for the advancement of mankind for theirnourishment training and education they can administer the earth as aneconomic power and particularly compare the capacities of men andselect them accordingly. This new conscious civilization is killing theother which on the whole has led but an unreflective animal and plantlife: it is also destroying the doubt of progress itself--progress ispossible. I mean: it is hasty and almost unreflective to assume thatprogress must _necessarily_ take place: but how can it be doubted thatprogress is possible On the other hand progress in the sense and alongthe lines of the old civilization is not even conceivable. If romanticfantasy employs the word progress in connection with certain aims andends identical with those of the circumscribed primitive nationalcivilizations the picture presented of progress is always borrowed fromthe past. The idea and the image of progress thus formed are quitewithout originality. Cultur culture civilisation etc. but there is no exact Englishequivalent.=Private Ethics and World Ethics.=--Since the extinction of the beliefthat a god guides the general destiny of the world and notwithstandingall the contortions and windings of the path of mankind leads itgloriously forward men must shape oecumenical world-embracing ends forthemselves. The older ethics namely Kants required of the individualsuch a course of conduct as he wishes all men to follow. This evincesmuch simplicity--as if any individual could determine off hand whatcourse of conduct would conduce to the welfare of humanity and whatcourse of conduct is preÃ«minently desirable! This is a theory like thatof freedom of competition which takes it for granted that the generalharmony of things _must_ prevail of itself in accordance with someinherent law of betterment or amelioration. It may be that a latercontemplation of the needs of mankind will reveal that it is by no meansdesirable that all men should regulate their conduct according to thesame principle; it may be best from the standpoint of certain ends yetto be attained that men during long periods should regulate theirconduct with reference to special and even in certain circumstancesevil objects. At any rate if mankind is not to be led astray by such auniversal rule of conduct it behooves it to attain a _knowledge of thecondition of culture_ that will serve as a scientific standard ofcomparison in connection with cosmical ends. Herein is comprised thetremendous mission of the great spirits of the next century.=Reaction as Progress.=--Occasionally harsh powerful impetuous yetnevertheless backward spirits appear who try to conjure back some pastera in the history of mankind: they serve as evidence that the newtendencies which they oppose are not yet potent enough that there issomething lacking in them: otherwise they the tendencies would betterwithstand the effects of this conjuring back process. Thus Luthersreformation shows that in his century all the impulses to freedom of thespirit were still uncertain lacking in vigor and immature. Sciencecould not yet rear her head. Indeed the whole Renaissance appears but asan early spring smothered in snow. But even in the present centurySchopenhauers metaphysic shows that the scientific spirit is not yetpowerful enough: for the whole mediaeval Christian world-standpointWeltbetrachtung and conception of man Mensch-Empfindung onceagain notwithstanding the slowly wrought destruction of all Christiandogma celebrated a resurrection in Schopenhauers doctrine. There ismuch science in his teaching although the science does not dominatebut instead of it the old trite metaphysical necessity. It is oneof the greatest and most priceless advantages of Schopenhauers teachingthat by it our feelings are temporarily forced back to those old humanand cosmical standpoints to which no other path could conduct us soeasily. The gain for history and justice is very great. I believe thatwithout Schopenhauers aid it would be no easy matter for anyone now todo justice to Christianity and its Asiatic relatives--a thing impossibleas regards the christianity that still survives. After according thisgreat triumph to justice after we have corrected in so essential arespect the historical point of view which the age of learning broughtwith it we may begin to bear still farther onward the banner ofenlightenment--a banner bearing the three names: Petrarch ErasmusVoltaire. We have taken a forward step out of reaction. Literally man-feeling or human outlook.=A Substitute for Religion.=--It is supposed to be a recommendation forphilosophy to say of it that it provides the people with a substitutefor religion. And in fact the training of the intellect doesnecessitate the convenient laying out of the track of thought since thetransition from religion by way of science entails a powerful perilousleap--something that should be advised against. With thisqualification the recommendation referred to is a just one. At the sametime it should be further explained that the needs which religionsatisfies and which science must now satisfy are not immutable. Eventhey can be diminished and uprooted. Think for instance of thechristian soul-need the sighs over ones inner corruption the anxietyregarding salvation--all notions that arise simply out of errors of thereason and require no satisfaction at all but annihilation. Aphilosophy can either so affect these needs as to appease them or elseput them aside altogether for they are acquired circumscribed needsbased upon hypotheses which those of science explode. Here for thepurpose of affording the means of transition for the sake of lighteningthe spirit overburdened with feeling art can be employed to far betterpurpose as these hypotheses receive far less support from art than froma metaphysical philosophy. Then from art it is easier to go over to areally emancipating philosophical science.=Discredited Words.=--Away with the disgustingly over-used wordsoptimism and pessimism! For the occasion for using them grows dailyless; only drivelers now find them indispensably necessary. What earthlyreason could anyone have for being an optimist unless he had a god todefend who _must_ have created the best of all possible worlds since heis himself all goodness and perfection--but what thinking man has nowany need for the hypothesis that there is a god--There is also nooccasion whatever for a pessimistic confession of faith unless one hasa personal interest in denouncing the advocate of god the theologian orthe theological philosopher and maintaining the counter propositionthat evil reigns that wretchedness is more potent than joy that theworld is a piece of botch work that phenomenon Erscheinung is but themanifestation of some evil spirit. But who bothers his head about thetheologians any more--except the theologians themselves Apart from alltheology and its antagonism it is manifest that the world is neithergood nor bad to say nothing about its being the best or the worst andthat these ideas of good and bad have significance only in relationto men indeed are without significance at all in view of the sense inwhich they are usually employed. The contemptuous and the eulogisticpoint of view must in every case be repudiated.=Intoxicated by the Perfume of Flowers.=--The ship of humanity it isthought acquires an ever deeper draught the more it is laden. It isbelieved that the more profoundly man thinks the more exquisitely hefeels the higher the standard he sets for himself the greater hisdistance from the other animals--the more he appears as a geniusGenie among animals--the nearer he gets to the true nature of theworld and to comprehension thereof: this indeed he really does throughscience but he thinks he does it far more adequately through hisreligions and arts. These are certainly a blossoming of the world butnot therefore _nearer the roots of the world_ than is the stalk. Onecannot learn best from it the nature of the world although nearlyeveryone thinks so. _Error_ has made men so deep sensitive andimaginative in order to bring forth such flowers as religions and arts.Pure apprehension would be unable to do that. Whoever should disclose tous the essence of the world would be undeceiving us most cruelly. Notthe world as thing-in-itself but the world as idea as error isrich in portent deep wonderful carrying happiness and unhappiness inits womb. This result leads to a philosophy of world negation: which atany rate can be as well combined with a practical world affirmation aswith its opposite. Vorstellung: this word sometimes corresponds to the English wordidea at others to conception or notion.=Evil Habits in Reaching Conclusions.=--The most usual erroneousconclusions of men are these: a thing exists therefore it is right:Here from capacity to live is deduced fitness from fitness is deducedjustification. So also: an opinion gives happiness therefore it is thetrue one its effect is good therefore it is itself good and true. Hereis predicated of the effect that it gives happiness that it is good inthe sense of utility and there is likewise predicated of the cause thatit is good but good in the sense of logical validity. Conversely theproposition would run: a thing cannot attain success cannotmaintain itself therefore it is evil: a belief troubles the believeroccasions pain therefore it is false. The free spirit who is sensibleof the defect in this method of reaching conclusions and has had tosuffer its consequences often succumbs to the temptation to come to thevery opposite conclusions which in general are of course equallyerroneous: a thing cannot maintain itself: therefore it is good; abelief is troublesome therefore it is true. Sache thing but not in the sense of Ding. Sache is of veryindefinite application res.=The Illogical is Necessary.=--Among the things which can bring athinker to distraction is the knowledge that the illogical is necessaryto mankind and that from the illogical springs much that is good. Theillogical is so imbedded in the passions in language in art inreligion and above all in everything that imparts value to life thatit cannot be taken away without irreparably injuring those beautifulthings. Only men of the utmost simplicity can believe that the natureman knows can be changed into a purely logical nature. Yet were theresteps affording approach to this goal how utterly everything would belost on the way! Even the most rational man needs nature again fromtime to time that is his illogical fundamental relationGrundstellung to all things.=Being Unjust is Essential.=--All judgments of the value of life areillogically developed and therefore unjust. The vice of the judgmentconsists first in the way in which the subject matter comes underobservation that is very incompletely; secondly in the way in whichthe total is summed up; and thirdly in the fact that each single itemin the totality of the subject matter is itself the result of defectiveperception and this from absolute necessity. No practical knowledge ofa man for example stood he never so near to us can be complete--sothat we could have a logical right to form a total estimate of him; allestimates are summary and must be so. Then the standard by which wemeasure our being is not an immutable quantity; we have moods andvariations and yet we should know ourselves as an invariable standardbefore we undertake to establish the nature of the relation of any thingSache to ourselves. Perhaps it will follow from all this that oneshould form no judgments whatever; if one could but merely _live_without having to form estimates without aversion and withoutpartiality!--for everything most abhorred is closely connected with anestimate as well as every strongest partiality. An inclination towardsa thing or from a thing without an accompanying feeling that thebeneficial is desired and the pernicious contemned an inclinationwithout a sort of experiential estimation of the desirability of an enddoes not exist in man. We are primordially illogical and hence unjustbeings _and can recognise this fact_: this is one of the greatest andmost baffling discords of existence.=Error Respecting Living for the Sake of Living Essential.=--Everybelief in the value and worthiness of life rests upon defectivethinking; it is for this reason alone possible that sympathy with thegeneral life and suffering of mankind is so imperfectly developed in theindividual. Even exceptional men who can think beyond their ownpersonalities do not have this general life in view but isolatedportions of it. If one is capable of fixing his observation uponexceptional cases I mean upon highly endowed individuals and puresouled beings if their development is taken as the true end ofworld-evolution and if joy be felt in their existence then it ispossible to believe in the value of life because in that case the restof humanity is overlooked: hence we have here defective thinking. Sotoo it is even if all mankind be taken into consideration and onespecies only of impulses the less egoistic brought under review andthose in consideration of the other impulses exalted: then somethingcould still be hoped of mankind in the mass and to that extent therecould exist belief in the value of life: here again as a result ofdefective thinking. Whatever attitude thus one may assume one is asa result of this attitude an exception among mankind. Now the greatmajority of mankind endure life without any great protest and believeto this extent in the value of existence but that is because eachindividual decides and determines alone and never comes out of his ownpersonality like these exceptions: everything outside of the personalhas no existence for them or at the utmost is observed as but a faintshadow. Consequently the value of life for the generality of mankindconsists simply in the fact that the individual attaches more importanceto himself than he does to the world. The great lack of imagination fromwhich he suffers is responsible for his inability to enter into thefeelings of beings other than himself and hence his sympathy with theirfate and suffering is of the slightest possible description. On theother hand whosoever really _could_ sympathise necessarily doubts thevalue of life; were it possible for him to sum up and to feel in himselfthe total consciousness of mankind he would collapse with a maledictionagainst existence--for mankind is in the mass without a goal andhence man cannot find in the contemplation of his whole courseanything to serve him as a mainstay and a comfort but rather a reasonto despair. If he looks beyond the things that immediately engage him tothe final aimlessness of humanity his own conduct assumes in his eyesthe character of a frittering away. To feel oneself however ashumanity not alone as an individual frittered away exactly as we seethe stray leaves frittered away by nature is a feeling transcending allfeeling. But who is capable of it Only a poet certainly: and poetsalways know how to console themselves.=For Tranquility.=--But will not our philosophy become thus a tragedyWill not truth prove the enemy of life of betterment A question seemsto weigh upon our tongue and yet will not put itself into words: whetherone _can_ knowingly remain in the domain of the untruthful or if one_must_ whether then death would not be preferable For there is nolonger any ought Sollen morality; so far as it is involved oughtis through our point of view as utterly annihilated as religion. Ourknowledge can permit only pleasure and pain benefit and injury tosubsist as motives. But how can these motives be distinguished from thedesire for truth Even they rest upon error in so far as alreadystated partiality and dislike and their very inaccurate estimatespalpably modify our pleasure and our pain. The whole of human life isdeeply involved in _untruth_. The individual cannot extricate it fromthis pit without thereby fundamentally clashing with his whole pastwithout finding his present motives of conduct as that of honorillegitimate and without opposing scorn and contempt to the ambitionswhich prompt one to have regard for the future and for ones happinessin the future. Is it true does there then remain but one way ofthinking which as a personal consequence brings in its train despairand as a theoretical consequence brings in its train a philosophy ofdecay disintegration self annihilation I believe the decidinginfluence as regards the after-effect of knowledge will be the_temperament_ of a man; I can in addition to this after-effect justmentioned suppose another by means of which a much simpler life andone freer from disturbances than the present could be lived; so that atfirst the old motives of vehement passion might still have strengthowing to hereditary habit but they would gradually grow weaker underthe influence of purifying knowledge. A man would live at last bothamong men and unto himself as in the natural state without praisereproach competition feasting ones eyes as if it were a play uponmuch that formerly inspired dread. One would be rid of the strenuouselement and would no longer feel the goad of the reflection that man isnot even as much as nature nor more than nature. To be sure thisrequires as already stated a good temperament a fortified gentle andnaturally cheerful soul a disposition that has no need to be on itsguard against its own eccentricities and sudden outbreaks and that inits utterances manifests neither sullenness nor a snarling tone--thosefamiliar disagreeable characteristics of old dogs and old men that havebeen a long time chained up. Rather must a man from whom the ordinarybondages of life have fallen away to so great an extent so do that heonly lives on in order to grow continually in knowledge and to learn toresign without envy and without disappointment much yes nearlyeverything that has value in the eyes of men. He must be content withsuch a free fearless soaring above men manners laws and traditionalestimates of things as the most desirable of all situations. He willfreely share the joy of being in such a situation and he has perhapsnothing else to share--in which renunciation and self-denial really mostconsist. But if more is asked of him he will with a benevolent shakeof the head refer to his brother the free man of fact and willperhaps not dissemble a little contempt: for as regards his freedomthereby hangs a tale. den mit dessen Freiheit hat es eine eigene Bewandtniss.HISTORY OF THE MORAL FEELINGS.=Advantages of Psychological Observation.=--That reflection regardingthe human all-too-human--or as the learned jargon is: psychologicalobservation--is among the means whereby the burden of life can be madelighter that practice in this art affords presence of mind in difficultsituations and entertainment amid a wearisome environment aye thatmaxims may be culled in the thorniest and least pleasing paths of lifeand invigoration thereby obtained: this much was believed was known--informer centuries. Why was this forgotten in our own century duringwhich at least in Germany yes in Europe poverty as regardspsychological observation would have been manifest in many ways hadthere been anyone to whom this poverty could have manifested itself. Notonly in the novel in the romance in philosophical standpoints--theseare the works of exceptional men; still more in the state of opinionregarding public events and personages; above all in general societywhich says much about men but nothing whatever about man there istotally lacking the art of psychological analysis and synthesis. But whyis the richest and most harmless source of entertainment thus allowed torun to waste Why is the greatest master of the psychological maxim nolonger read--for with no exaggeration whatever be it said: theeducated person in Europe who has read La Rochefoucauld and hisintellectual and artistic affinities is very hard to find; still harderthe person who knows them and does not disparage them. Apparently toothis unusual reader takes far less pleasure in them than the formadopted by these artists should afford him: for the subtlest mind cannotadequately appreciate the art of maxim-making unless it has had trainingin it unless it has competed in it. Without such practicalacquaintance one is apt to look upon this making and forming as a mucheasier thing than it really is; one is not keenly enough alive to thefelicity and the charm of success. Hence present day readers of maximshave but a moderate tempered pleasure in them scarcely indeed a trueperception of their merit so that their experiences are about the sameas those of the average beholder of cameos: people who praise becausethey cannot appreciate and are very ready to admire and still readierto turn away.=Objection.=--Or is there a counter-proposition to the dictum thatpsychological observation is one of the means of consoling lighteningcharming existence Have enough of the unpleasant effects of this artbeen experienced to justify the person striving for culture in turninghis regard away from it In all truth a certain blind faith in thegoodness of human nature an implanted distaste for any disparagement ofhuman concerns a sort of shamefacedness at the nakedness of the soulmay be far more desirable things in the general happiness of a man thanthis only occasionally advantageous quality of psychologicalsharpsightedness; and perhaps belief in the good in virtuous men andactions in a plenitude of disinterested benevolence has been moreproductive of good in the world of men in so far as it has made men lessdistrustful. If Plutarchs heroes are enthusiastically imitated and areluctance is experienced to looking too critically into the motives oftheir actions not the knowledge but the welfare of human society ispromoted thereby: psychological error and above all obtuseness in regardto it help human nature forward whereas knowledge of the truth is morepromoted by means of the stimulating strength of a hypothesis; as LaRochefoucauld in the first edition of his Sentences and Moral Maximshas expressed it: What the world calls virtue is ordinarily but aphantom created by the passions and to which we give a good name inorder to do whatever we please with impunity. La Rochefoucauld andthose other French masters of soul-searching to the number of whom haslately been added a German the author of Psychological Observationsare like expert marksmen who again and again hit the black spot--but itis the black spot in human nature. Their art inspires amazement butfinally some spectator inspired not by the scientific spirit but by ahumanitarian feeling execrates an art that seems to implant in the soula taste for belittling and impeaching mankind.=Nevertheless.=--The matter therefore as regards pro and con standsthus: in the present state of philosophy an awakening of the moralobservation is essential. The repulsive aspect of psychologicaldissection with the knife and tweezers entailed by the process can nolonger be spared humanity. Such is the imperative duty of any sciencethat investigates the origin and history of the so-called moral feelingsand which in its progress is called upon to posit and to solveadvanced social problems:--The older philosophy does not recognize thenewer at all and through paltry evasions has always gone astray in theinvestigation of the origin and history of human estimatesWerthschÃ¤tzungen. With what results may now be very clearly perceivedsince it has been shown by many examples how the errors of the greatestphilosophers have their origin in a false explanation of certain humanactions and feelings; how upon the foundation of an erroneous analysisfor example of the so called disinterested actions a false ethic isreared to support which religion and like mythological monstrositiesare called in until finally the shades of these troubled spiritscollapse in physics and in the comprehensive world point of view. But ifit be established that superficiality of psychological observation hasheretofore set the most dangerous snares for human judgment anddeduction and will continue to do so all the greater need is there ofthat steady continuance of labor that never wearies putting stone uponstone little stone upon little stone; all the greater need is there ofa courage that is not ashamed of such humble labor and that will opposepersistence to all contempt. It is finally also true that countlesssingle observations concerning the human all-too-human have beenfirst made and uttered in circles accustomed not to furnish matter forscientific knowledge but for intellectual pleasure-seeking; and theoriginal home atmosphere--a very seductive atmosphere--of the moralmaxim has almost inextricably interpenetrated the entire species sothat the scientific man involuntarily manifests a sort of mistrust ofthis species and of its seriousness. But it is sufficient to point tothe consequences: for already it is becoming evident that events of themost portentous nature are developing in the domain of psychologicalobservation. What is the leading conclusion arrived at by one of thesubtlest and calmest of thinkers the author of the work Concerning theOrigin of the Moral Feelings as a result of his thorough and incisiveanalysis of human conduct The moral man he says stands no nearerthe knowable metaphysical world than the physical man. Thisdictum grown hard and cutting beneath the hammer-blow of historicalknowledge can some day perhaps in some future or other serve as theaxe that will be laid to the root of the metaphysical necessities ofmen--whether more to the blessing than to the banning of universal wellbeing who can say--but in any event a dictum fraught with the mostmomentous consequences fruitful and fearful at once and confrontingthe world in the two faced way characteristic of all great facts. Der moralische Mensch sagt er steht der intelligiblenmetaphysischen Welt nicht nÃ¤her als der physische Mensch.=To What Extent Useful.=--Therefore whether psychological observationis more an advantage than a disadvantage to mankind may always remainundetermined: but there is no doubt that it is necessary becausescience can no longer dispense with it. Science however recognizes noconsiderations of ultimate goals or ends any more than nature does; butas the latter duly matures things of the highest fitness for certainends without any intention of doing it so will true science doing withideas what nature does with matter promote the purposes and thewelfare of humanity as occasion may afford and in many ways andattain fitness to ends--but likewise without having intended it. als die Nachahmung der Natur in Begriffen literally: as thecounterfeit of nature in regard to ideas.He to whom the atmospheric conditions of such a prospect are too wintryhas too little fire in him: let him look about him and he will becomesensible of maladies requiring an icy air and of people who are sokneaded together out of ardor and intellect that they can scarcelyfind anywhere an atmosphere too cold and cutting for them. Moreover: astoo serious individuals and nations stand in need of trivialrelaxations; as others too volatile and excitable require onerousweighty ordeals to render them entirely healthy: should not we the moreintellectual men of this age which is swept more and more byconflagrations catch up every cooling and extinguishing appliance wecan find that we may always remain as self contained steady and calm aswe are now and thereby perhaps serve this age as its mirror and selfreflector when the occasion arises=The Fable of Discretionary Freedom.=--The history of the feelings onthe basis of which we make everyone responsible hence the so-calledmoral feelings is traceable in the following leading phases. At firstsingle actions are termed good or bad without any reference to theirmotive but solely because of the utilitarian or prejudicialconsequences they have for the community. In time however the originof these designations is forgotten but it is imagined that action initself without reference to its consequences contains the propertygood or bad: with the same error according to which languagedesignates the stone itself as hardness the tree itself asgreenness--for the reason therefore that what is a consequence iscomprehended as a cause. Accordingly the goodness or badness isincorporated into the motive and any deed by itself is regarded asmorally ambiguous. A step further is taken and the predication good orbad is no longer made of the particular motives but of the entire natureof a man out of which motive grows as grow the plants out of the soil.Thus man is successively made responsible for his particular actsthen for his course of conduct then for his motives and finally forhis nature. Now at last is it discovered that this nature evencannot be responsible inasmuch as it is only and wholly a necessaryconsequence and is synthesised out of the elements and influence of pastand present things: therefore that man is to be made responsible fornothing neither for his nature nor his motives nor his course ofconduct nor his particular acts. By this process is gained theknowledge that the history of moral estimates is the history of errorof the error of responsibility: as is whatever rests upon the error ofthe freedom of the will. Schopenhauer concluded just the other waythus: since certain actions bring depression consciousness of guiltin their train there must then exist responsibility for there wouldbe no basis for this depression at hand if all mans affairs did notfollow their course of necessity--as they do indeed according to theopinion of this philosopher follow their course--but man himselfsubject to the same necessity would be just the man that he is--whichSchopenhauer denies. From the fact of such depression Schopenhauerbelieves himself able to prove a freedom which man in some way must havehad not indeed in regard to his actions but in regard to his nature:freedom therefore to be thus and so not to act thus and so. Out ofthe _esse_ the sphere of freedom and responsibility follows accordingto his opinion the _operari_ the spheres of invariable causationnecessity and irresponsibility. This depression indeed is dueapparently to the _operari_--in so far as it be delusive--but in truthto whatever _esse_ be the deed of a free will the basic cause of theexistence of an individual: in order to let man become whatever hewills to become his to will Wollen must precede hisexistence.--Here apart from the absurdity of the statement just madethere is drawn the wrong inference that the fact of the depressionexplains its character the rational admissibility of it: from such awrong inference does Schopenhauer first come to his fantastic consequentof the so called discretionary freedom intelligibeln Freiheit. Forthe origin of this fabulous entity Plato and Kant are equallyresponsible. But depression after the act does not need to be rational:indeed it is certainly not so at all for it rests upon the erroneousassumption that the act need not necessarily have come to pass.Therefore: only because man deems himself free but not becausehe is free does he experience remorse and the stings ofconscience.--Moreover this depression is something that can be grownout of; in many men it is not present at all as a consequence of actswhich inspire it in many other men. It is a very varying thing and oneclosely connected with the development of custom and civilization andperhaps manifest only during a relatively brief period of the worldshistory.--No one is responsible for his acts no one for his nature; tojudge is tantamount to being unjust. This applies as well when theindividual judges himself. The proposition is as clear as sunlight andyet here everyone prefers to go back to darkness and untruth: for fearof the consequences.=Above Animal.=--The beast in us must be wheedled: ethic is necessarythat we may not be torn to pieces. Without the errors involved in theassumptions of ethics man would have remained an animal. Thus has hetaken himself as something higher and imposed rigid laws upon himself.He feels hatred consequently for states approximating the animal:whence the former contempt for the slave as a not-yet-man as a thingis to be explained.=Unalterable Character.=--That character is unalterable is not in thestrict sense true; rather is this favorite proposition valid only tothe extent that during the brief life period of a man the potent newmotives can not usually press down hard enough to obliterate the linesimprinted by ages. Could we conceive of a man eighty thousand years oldwe should have in him an absolutely alterable character; so that thematurities of successive varying individuals would develop in him. Theshortness of human life leads to many erroneous assertions concerningthe qualities of man.=Classification of Enjoyments and Ethic.=--The once accepted comparativeclassification of enjoyments according to which an inferior higherhighest egoism may crave one or another enjoyment now decides as toethical status or unethical status. A lower enjoyment for examplesensual pleasure preferred to a more highly esteemed one for examplehealth rates as unethical as does welfare preferred to freedom. Thecomparative classification of enjoyments is not however alike or thesame at all periods; when anyone demands satisfaction of the law he isfrom the point of view of an earlier civilization moral from that ofthe present non-moral. Unethical indicates therefore that a man isnot sufficiently sensible to the higher finer impulses which thepresent civilization has brought with it or is not sensible to them atall; it indicates backwardness but only from the point of view of thecontemporary degree of distinction.--The comparative classification ofenjoyments itself is not determined according to absolute ethics; butafter each new ethical adjustment it is then decided whether conduct beethical or the reverse.=Inhuman Men as Survivals.=--Men who are now inhuman must serve us assurviving specimens of earlier civilizations. The mountain height ofhumanity here reveals its lower formations which might otherwise remainhidden from view. There are surviving specimens of humanity whose brainsthrough the vicissitudes of heredity have escaped proper development.They show us what we all were and thus appal us; but they are as littleresponsible on this account as is a piece of granite for being granite.In our own brains there must be courses and windings corresponding tosuch characters just as in the forms of some human organs there survivetraces of fishhood. But these courses and windings are no longer the bedin which flows the stream of our feeling.=Gratitude and Revenge.=--The reason the powerful man is grateful isthis. His benefactor has through his benefaction invaded the domain ofthe powerful man and established himself on an equal footing: thepowerful man in turn invades the domain of the benefactor and getssatisfaction through the act of gratitude. It is a mild form of revenge.By not obtaining the satisfaction of gratitude the powerful would haveshown himself powerless and have ranked as such thenceforward. Henceevery society of the good that is to say of the powerful originallyplaces gratitude among the first of duties.--Swift has added the dictumthat man is grateful in the same degree that he is revengeful.=Two-fold Historical Origin of Good and Evil.=--The notion of good andbad has a two-fold historical origin: namely first in the spirit ofruling races and castes. Whoever has power to requite good with good andevil with evil and actually brings requital that is is grateful andrevengeful acquires the name of being good; whoever is powerless andcannot requite is called bad. A man belongs as a good individual tothe good of a community who have a feeling in common because all theindividuals are allied with one another through the requiting sentiment.A man belongs as a bad individual to the bad to a mass ofsubjugated powerless men who have no feeling in common. The good are acaste the bad are a quantity like dust. Good and bad is for aconsiderable period tantamount to noble and servile master and slave.On the other hand an enemy is not looked upon as bad: he can requite.The Trojan and the Greek are in Homer both good. Not he who does noharm but he who is despised is deemed bad. In the community of thegood individuals the quality of goodness is inherited; it isimpossible for a bad individual to grow from such a rich soil. Ifnotwithstanding one of the good individuals does something unworthy ofhis goodness recourse is had to exorcism; thus the guilt is ascribed toa deity the while it is declared that this deity bewitched the good maninto madness and blindness.--Second in the spirit of the subjugatedthe powerless. Here every other man is to the individual hostileinconsiderate greedy inhuman avaricious be he noble or servile; badis the characteristic term for man for every living being indeed thatis recognized at all even for a god: human divine these notions aretantamount to devilish bad. Manifestations of goodness sympathyhelpfulness are regarded with anxiety as trickiness preludes to anevil end deception subtlety in short as refined badness. With such apredisposition in individuals a feeling in common can scarcely arise atall at most only the rudest form of it: so that everywhere that thisconception of good and evil prevails the destruction of theindividuals their race and nation is imminent.--Our existing moralityhas developed upon the foundation laid by ruling races and castes.=Sympathy Greater than Suffering.=--There are circumstances in whichsympathy is stronger than the suffering itself. We feel more pain forinstance when one of our friends becomes guilty of a reprehensibleaction than if we had done the deed ourselves. We once that is hadmore faith in the purity of his character than he had himself. Hence ourlove for him apparently because of this very faith is stronger thanis his own love for himself. If indeed his egoism really suffers moreas a result than our egoism inasmuch as he must take the consequencesof his fault to a greater extent than ourselves nevertheless theunegoistic--this word is not to be taken too strictly but simply as amodified form of expression--in us is more affected by his guilt thanthe unegoistic in him.=Hypochondria.=--There are people who from sympathy and anxiety forothers become hypochondriacal. The resulting form of compassion isnothing else than sickness. So also is there a Christian hypochondriafrom which those singular religiously agitated people suffer who placealways before their eyes the suffering and death of Christ.=Economy of Blessings.=--The advantageous and the pleasing as thehealthiest growths and powers in the intercourse of men are suchprecious treasures that it is much to be wished the use made of thesebalsamic means were as economical as possible: but this is impossible.Economy in the use of blessings is the dream of the craziest ofUtopians.=Well-Wishing.=--Among the small but infinitely plentiful and thereforevery potent things to which science must pay more attention than to thegreat uncommon things well-wishing must be reckoned; I mean thosemanifestations of friendly disposition in intercourse that laughter ofthe eye every hand pressure every courtesy from which in generalevery human act gets its quality. Every teacher every functionary addsthis element as a gratuity to whatever he does as a duty; it is theperpetual well spring of humanity like the waves of light in whicheverything grows; thus in the narrowest circles within the familylife blooms and flowers only through this kind feeling. Thecheerfulness friendliness and kindness of a heart are unfailingsources of unegoistic impulse and have made far more for civilizationthan those other more noised manifestations of it that are styledsympathy benevolence and sacrifice. But it is customary to depreciatethese little tokens of kindly feeling and indeed there is not much ofthe unegoistic in them. The sum of these little doses is very greatnevertheless; their combined strength is of the greatest ofstrengths.--Thus too much more happiness is to be found in the worldthan gloomy eyes discover: that is if the calculation be just and allthese pleasing moments in which every day even the meanest human lifeis rich be not forgotten. Wohl-wollen kind feeling. It stands here for benevolence but notbenevolence in the restricted sense of the word now prevailing.=The Desire to Inspire Compassion.=--La Rochefoucauld in the mostnotable part of his self portraiture first printed  reaches thevital spot of truth when he warns all those endowed with reason to be ontheir guard against compassion when he advises that this sentiment beleft to men of the masses who stand in need of the promptings of theemotions since they are not guided by reason to induce them to giveaid to the suffering and to be of service in misfortune: whereascompassion in his and Platos view deprives the heart of strength.To be sure sympathy should be manifested but men should take care notto feel it; for the unfortunate are rendered so dull that themanifestation of sympathy affords them the greatest happiness in theworld.--Perhaps a more effectual warning against this compassion can begiven if this need of the unfortunate be considered not simply asstupidity and intellectual weakness not as a sort of distraction of thespirit entailed by misfortune itself and thus indeed does LaRochefoucauld seem to view it but as something quite different and moremomentous. Let note be taken of children who cry and scream in order tobe compassionated and who therefore await the moment when theircondition will be observed; come into contact with the sick and theoppressed in spirit and try to ascertain if the wailing and sighing theposturing and posing of misfortune do not have as end and aim thecausing of pain to the beholder: the sympathy which each beholdermanifests is a consolation to the weak and suffering only in as much asthey are made to perceive that at least they have the powernotwithstanding all their weakness to inflict pain. The unfortunateexperiences a species of joy in the sense of superiority which themanifestation of sympathy entails; his imagination is exalted; he isalways strong enough then to cause the world pain. Thus is the thirstfor sympathy a thirst for self enjoyment and at the expense of onesfellow creatures: it shows man in the whole ruthlessness of his own dearself: not in his mere dullness as La Rochefoucauld thinks.--In socialconversation three fourths of all the questions are asked and threefourths of all the replies are made in order to inflict some littlepain; that is why so many people crave social intercourse: it gives thema sense of their power. In these countless but very small doses in whichthe quality of badness is administered it proves a potent stimulant oflife: to the same extent that well wishing--Wohl-wollen distributedthrough the world in like manner is one of the ever readyrestoratives.--But will many honorable people be found to admit thatthere is any pleasure in administering pain that entertainment--andrare entertainment--is not seldom found in causing others at least inthought some pain and in raking them with the small shot ofwickedness The majority are too ignoble and a few are too good to knowanything of this pudendum: the latter may consequently be prompt todeny that Prosper MÃ©rimÃ©e is right when he says: Know also thatnothing is more common than to do wrong for the pleasure of doing it.=How Appearance Becomes Reality.=--The actor cannot at last refraineven in moments of the deepest pain from thinking of the effectproduced by his deportment and by his surroundings--for example even atthe funeral of his own child: he will weep at his own sorrow and itsmanifestations as though he were his own audience. The hypocrite whoalways plays one and the same part finally ceases to be a hypocrite; asin the case of priests who when young men are always eitherconsciously or unconsciously hypocrites and finally become naturallyand then really without affectation mere priests: or if the fatherdoes not carry it to this extent the son who inherits his fatherscalling and gets the advantage of the paternal progress does. Whenanyone during a long period and persistently wishes to appearsomething it will at last prove difficult for him to be anything else.The calling of almost every man even of the artist begins withhypocrisy with an imitation of deportment with a copying of theeffective in manner. He who always wears the mask of a friendly man mustat last gain a power over friendliness of disposition without which theexpression itself of friendliness is not to be gained--and finallyfriendliness of disposition gains the ascendancy over him--he _is_benevolent.=The Point of Honor in Deception.=--In all great deceivers onecharacteristic is prominent to which they owe their power. In the veryact of deception amid all the accompaniments the agitation in thevoice the expression the bearing in the crisis of the scene therecomes over them a belief in themselves; this it is that acts soeffectively and irresistibly upon the beholders. Founders of religionsdiffer from such great deceivers in that they never come out of thisstate of self deception or else they have very rarely a few momentsof enlightenment in which they are overcome by doubt; generallyhowever they soothe themselves by ascribing such moments ofenlightenment to the evil adversary. Self deception must exist that bothclasses of deceivers may attain far reaching results. For men believe inthe truth of all that is manifestly believed with due implicitness byothers.=Presumed Degrees of Truth.=--One of the most usual errors of deductionis: because someone truly and openly is against us therefore he speaksthe truth. Hence the child has faith in the judgments of its elders theChristian in the assertions of the founder of the church. So too itwill not be admitted that all for which men sacrificed life andhappiness in former centuries was nothing but delusion: perhaps it isalleged these things were degrees of truth. But what is really meant isthat if a person sincerely believes a thing and has fought and died forhis faith it would be too _unjust_ if only delusion had inspired him.Such a state of affairs seems to contradict eternal justice. For thatreason the heart of a sensitive man pronounces against his head thejudgment: between moral conduct and intellectual insight there mustalways exist an inherent connection. It is unfortunately otherwise:for there is no eternal justice.=Falsehood.=--Why do men as a rule speak the truth in the ordinaryaffairs of life Certainly not for the reason that a god has forbiddenlying. But because first: it is more convenient as falsehood entailsinvention make-believe and recollection wherefore Swift says thatwhoever invents a lie seldom realises the heavy burden he takes up: hemust namely for every lie that he tells insert twenty more.Therefore because in plain ordinary relations of life it is expedientto say without circumlocution: I want this I have done this and thelike; therefore because the way of freedom and certainty is surer thanthat of ruse.--But if it happens that a child is brought up in sinisterdomestic circumstances it will then indulge in falsehood as matter ofcourse and involuntarily say anything its own interests may prompt: aninclination for truth an aversion to falsehood is quite foreign anduncongenial to it and hence it lies in all innocence.=Ethic Discredited for Faiths Sake.=--No power can sustain itself whenit is represented by mere humbugs: the Catholic Church may possess everso many worldly sources of strength but its true might is comprisedin those still numberless priestly natures who make their lives sternand strenuous and whose looks and emaciated bodies are eloquent of nightvigils fasts ardent prayer perhaps even of whip lashes: these thingsmake men tremble and cause them anxiety: what if it be reallyimperative to live thus This is the dreadful question which theiraspect occasions. As they spread this doubt they lay anew the prop oftheir power: even the free thinkers dare not oppose suchdisinterestedness with severe truth and cry: Thou deceived onedeceive not!--Only the difference of standpoint separates them fromhim: no difference in goodness or badness. But things we cannotaccomplish ourselves we are apt to criticise unfairly. Thus we are toldof the cunning and perverted acts of the Jesuits but we overlook theself mastery that each Jesuit imposes upon himself and also the factthat the easy life which the Jesuit manuals advocate is for the benefitnot of the Jesuits but the laity. Indeed it may be questioned whetherwe enlightened ones would become equally competent workers as the resultof similar tactics and organization and equally worthy of admiration asthe result of self mastery indefatigable industry and devotion.=Victory of Knowledge over Radical Evil.=--It proves a material gain tohim who would attain knowledge to have had during a considerable periodthe idea that mankind is a radically bad and perverted thing: it is afalse idea as is its opposite but it long held sway and its roots havereached down even to ourselves and our present world. In order tounderstand _ourselves_ we must understand _it_; but in order to attain aloftier height we must step above it. We then perceive that there is nosuch thing as sin in the metaphysical sense: but also in the samesense no such thing as virtue; that this whole domain of ethicalnotions is one of constant variation; that there are higher and deeperconceptions of good and evil moral and immoral. Whoever desires no moreof things than knowledge of them attains speedily to peace of mind andwill at most err through lack of knowledge but scarcely througheagerness for knowledge or through sin as the world calls it. He willnot ask that eagerness for knowledge be interdicted and rooted out; buthis single all powerful ambition to _know_ as thoroughly and as fullyas possible will soothe him and moderate all that is strenuous in hiscircumstances. Moreover he is now rid of a number of disturbingnotions; he is no longer beguiled by such words as hell-painsinfulness unworthiness: he sees in them merely the flitting shadowpictures of false views of life and of the world.=Ethic as Mans Self-Analysis.=--A good author whose heart is really inhis work wishes that someone would arise and wholly refute him if onlythereby his subject be wholly clarified and made plain. The maid in lovewishes that she could attest the fidelity of her own passion throughthe faithlessness of her beloved. The soldier wishes to sacrifice hislife on the field of his fatherlands victory: for in the victory of hisfatherland his highest end is attained. The mother gives her child whatshe deprives herself of--sleep the best nourishment and in certaincircumstances her health her self.--But are all these acts unegoisticAre these moral deeds miracles because they are in Schopenhauersphrase impossible and yet accomplished Is it not evident that in allfour cases man loves one part of himself a thought a longing anexperience more than he loves another part of himself that he thusanalyses his being and sacrifices one part of it to another part Isthis essentially different from the behavior of the obstinate man whosays I would rather be shot than go a step out of my way for thisfellow--Preference for something wish impulse longing is presentin all four instances: to yield to it with all its consequences is notunegoistic.--In the domain of the ethical man conducts himself not asindividuum but as dividuum.=What Can be Promised.=--Actions can be promised but not feelings forthese are involuntary. Whoever promises somebody to love him always orto hate him always or to be ever true to him promises something thatit is out of his power to bestow. But he really can promise such coursesof conduct as are the ordinary accompaniments of love of hate offidelity but which may also have their source in motives quitedifferent: for various ways and motives lead to the same conduct. Thepromise to love someone always means consequently: as long as I loveyou I will manifest the deportment of love; but if I cease to love youmy deportment although from some other motive will be just the sameso that to the people about us it will seem as if my love remainedunchanged.--Hence it is the continuance of the deportment of love thatis promised in every instance in which eternal love provided no elementof self deception be involved is sworn.=Intellect and Ethic.=--One must have a good memory to be able to keepthe promises one makes. One must have a strong imagination in order tofeel sympathy. So closely is ethics connected with intellectualcapacity.=Desire for Vengeance and Vengeance Itself.=--To meditate revenge andattain it is tantamount to an attack of fever that passes away: but tomeditate revenge without possessing the strength or courage to attain itis tantamount to suffering from a chronic malady or poisoning of bodyand soul. Ethics which takes only the motive into account rates bothcases alike: people generally estimate the first case as the worstbecause of the consequences which the deed of vengeance may entail.Both views are short sighted.=Ability to Wait.=--Ability to wait is so hard to acquire that greatpoets have not disdained to make inability to wait the central motive oftheir poems. So Shakespeare in Othello Sophocles in Ajax whose suicidewould not have seemed to him so imperative had he only been able to coolhis ardor for a day as the oracle foreboded: apparently he would thenhave repulsed somewhat the fearful whispers of distracted thought andhave said to himself: Who has not already in my situation mistaken asheep for a hero is it so extraordinary a thing On the contrary it issomething universally human: Ajax should thus have soothed himself.Passion will not wait: the tragic element in the lives of great men doesnot generally consist in their conflict with time and the inferiorityof their fellowmen but in their inability to put off their work a yearor two: they cannot wait.--In all duels the friends who advise have butto ascertain if the principals can wait: if this be not possible a duelis rational inasmuch as each of the combatants may say: either Icontinue to live and the other dies instantly or vice versa. To waitin such circumstances would be equivalent to the frightful martyrdom ofenduring dishonor in the presence of him responsible for the dishonor:and this can easily cost more anguish than life is worth.=Glutting Revenge.=--Coarse men who feel a sense of injury are in thehabit of rating the extent of their injury as high as possible and ofstating the occasion of it in greatly exaggerated language in order tobe able to feast themselves on the sentiments of hatred and revenge thusaroused.=Value of Disparagement.=--Not a few perhaps the majority of men findit necessary in order to retain their self esteem and a certainuprightness in conduct to mentally disparage and belittle all thepeople they know. But as the inferior natures are in the majority and asa great deal depends upon whether they retain or lose this uprightnessso--=The Man in a Rage.=--We should be on our guard against the man who isenraged against us as against one who has attempted our life for thefact that we still live consists solely in the inability to kill: werelooks sufficient it would have been all up with us long since. Toreduce anyone to silence by physical manifestations of savagery or by aterrorizing process is a relic of under civilization. So too that coldlook which great personages cast upon their servitors is a remnant ofthe caste distinction between man and man; a specimen of rude antiquity:women the conservers of the old have maintained this survival toomore perfectly than men.=Whither Honesty May Lead.=--Someone once had the bad habit ofexpressing himself upon occasion and with perfect honesty on thesubject of the motives of his conduct which were as good or as bad asthe motives of all men. He aroused first disfavor then suspicionbecame gradually of ill repute and was pronounced a person of whomsociety should beware until at last the law took note of such aperverted being for reasons which usually have no weight with it or towhich it closes its eyes. Lack of taciturnity concerning what isuniversally held secret and an irresponsible predisposition to see whatno one wants to see--oneself--brought him to prison and to early death.=Punishable not Punished.=--Our crime against criminals consists in thefact that we treat them as rascals.=Sancta simplicitas of Virtue.=--Every virtue has its privilege: forexample that of contributing its own little bundle of wood to thefuneral pyre of one condemned.=Morality and Consequence.=--Not alone the beholders of an act generallyestimate the ethical or unethical element in it by the result: no theone who performed the act does the same. For the motives and theintentions are seldom sufficiently apparent and amid them the memoryitself seems to become clouded by the results of the act so that a manoften ascribes the wrong motives to his acts or regards the remotemotives as the direct ones. Success often imparts to an action all thebrilliance and honor of good intention while failure throws the shadowof conscience over the most estimable deeds. Hence arises the familiarmaxim of the politician: Give me only success: with it I can win allthe noble souls over to my side--and make myself noble even in my owneyes.--In like manner will success prove an excellent substitute for abetter argument. To this very day many well educated men think thetriumph of Christianity over Greek philosophy is a proof of the superiortruth of the former--although in this case it was simply the coarser andmore powerful that triumphed over the more delicate and intellectual. Asregards superiority of truth it is evident that because of it thereviving sciences have connected themselves point for point with thephilosophy of Epicurus while Christianity has point for pointrecoiled from it.=Love and Justice.=--Why is love so highly prized at the expense ofjustice and why are such beautiful things spoken of the former as if itwere a far higher entity than the latter Is the former not palpably afar more stupid thing than the latter--Certainly and on that veryaccount so much the more agreeable to everybody: it is blind and has arich horn of plenty out of which it distributes its gifts to everyoneeven when they are unmerited even when no thanks are returned. It isimpartial like the rain which according to the bible and experiencewets not alone the unjust but in certain circumstances the just aswell and to their skins at that.=Execution.=--How comes it that every execution causes us more pain thana murder It is the coolness of the executioner the painfulpreparation the perception that here a man is being used as aninstrument for the intimidation of others. For the guilt is not punishedeven if there be any: this is ascribable to the teachers the parentsthe environment in ourselves not in the murderer--I mean thepredisposing circumstances.=Hope.=--Pandora brought the box containing evils and opened it. It wasthe gift of the gods to men a gift of most enticing appearanceexternally and called the box of happiness. Thereupon all the evilsliving moving things flew out: from that time to the present they flyabout and do ill to men by day and night. One evil only did not fly outof the box: Pandora shut the lid at the behest of Zeus and it remainedinside. Now man has this box of happiness perpetually in the house andcongratulates himself upon the treasure inside of it; it is at hisservice: he grasps it whenever he is so disposed for he knows not thatthe box which Pandora brought was a box of evils. Hence he looks uponthe one evil still remaining as the greatest source of happiness--it ishope.--Zeus intended that man notwithstanding the evils oppressing himshould continue to live and not rid himself of life but keep on makinghimself miserable. For this purpose he bestowed hope upon man: it is intruth the greatest of evils for it lengthens the ordeal of man.=Degree of Moral Susceptibility Unknown.=--The fact that one has or hasnot had certain profoundly moving impressions and insights intothings--for example an unjustly executed slain or martyred father afaithless wife a shattering serious accident--is the factor uponwhich the excitation of our passions to white heat principally dependsas well as the course of our whole lives. No one knows to what lengthscircumstances sympathy emotion may lead him. He does not know thefull extent of his own susceptibility. Wretched environment makes himwretched. It is as a rule not the quality of our experience but itsquantity upon which depends the development of our superiority orinferiority from the point of view of good and evil.=The Martyr Against His Will.=--In a certain movement there was a manwho was too cowardly and vacillating ever to contradict his comrades. Hewas made use of in each emergency every sacrifice was demanded of himbecause he feared the disfavor of his comrades more than he feareddeath: he was a petty abject spirit. They perceived this and upon thefoundation of the qualities just mentioned they elevated him to thealtitude of a hero and finally even of a martyr. Although the cowardlycreature always inwardly said No he always said Yes with his lips evenupon the scaffold where he died for the tenets of his party: for besidehim stood one of his old associates who so domineered him with look andword that he actually went to his death with the utmost fortitude andhas ever since been celebrated as a martyr and exalted character.=General Standard.=--One will rarely err if extreme actions be ascribedto vanity ordinary actions to habit and mean actions to fear.=Misunderstanding of Virtue.=--Whoever has obtained his experience ofvice in connection with pleasure as in the case of one with a youth ofwild oats behind him comes to the conclusion that virtue must beconnected with self denial. Whoever on the other hand has been verymuch plagued by his passions and vices longs to find in virtue the restand peace of the soul. That is why it is possible for two virtuouspeople to misunderstand one another wholly.=The Ascetic.=--The ascetic makes out of virtue a slavery.=Honor Transferred from Persons to Things.=--Actions prompted by love orby the spirit of self sacrifice for others are universally honoredwherever they are manifest. Hence is magnified the value set uponwhatever things may be loved or whatever things conduce to selfsacrifice: although in themselves they may be worth nothing much. Avaliant army is evidence of the value of the thing it fights for.=Ambition a Substitute for Moral Feeling.=--Moral feeling should neverbecome extinct in natures that are destitute of ambition. The ambitiouscan get along without moral feeling just as well as with it.--Hence thesons of retired ambitionless families generally become by a series ofrapid gradations when they lose moral feeling the most absolutelunkheads.=Vanity Enriches.=--How poor the human mind would be without vanity! Asit is it resembles a well stacked and ever renewed ware-emporium thatattracts buyers of every class: they can find almost everything havealmost everything provided they bring with them the right kind ofmoney--admiration.=Senility and Death.=--Apart from the demands made by religion it maywell be asked why it is more honorable in an aged man who feels thedecline of his powers to await slow extinction than to fix a term tohis existence himself Suicide in such a case is a quite natural and dueproceeding that ought to command respect as a triumph of reason: and didin fact command respect during the times of the masters of Greekphilosophy and the bravest Roman patriots who usually died by their ownhand. Eagerness on the other hand to keep alive from day to day withthe anxious counsel of physicians without capacity to attain any nearerto ones ideal of life is far less worthy of respect.--Religions arevery rich in refuges from the mandate of suicide: hence they ingratiatethemselves with those who cling to life.=Delusions Regarding Victim and Regarding Evil Doer.=--When the rich mantakes a possession away from the poor man for example a prince whodeprives a plebeian of his beloved there arises in the mind of the poorman a delusion: he thinks the rich man must be wholly perverted to takefrom him the little that he has. But the rich man appreciates the valueof a single possession much less because he is accustomed to manypossessions so that he cannot put himself in the place of the poor manand does not act by any means as ill as the latter supposes. Both have atotally false idea of each other. The iniquities of the mighty whichbulk most largely in history are not nearly so monstrous as they seem.The hereditary consciousness of being a superior being with superiorenvironment renders one very callous and lulls the conscience to rest.We all feel when the difference between ourselves and some other beingis exceedingly great that no element of injustice can be involved andwe kill a fly with no qualms of conscience whatever. So too it is noindication of wickedness in Xerxes whom even the Greeks represent asexceptionally noble that he deprived a father of his son and had himdrawn and quartered because the latter had manifested a troublesomeominous distrust of an entire expedition: the individual was in thiscase brushed aside as a pestiferous insect. He was too low and mean tojustify continued sentiments of compunction in the ruler of the world.Indeed no cruel man is ever as cruel in the main as his victim thinks.The idea of pain is never the same as the sensation. The rule isprecisely analogous in the case of the unjust judge and of thejournalist who by means of devious rhetorical methods leads publicopinion astray. Cause and effect are in all these instances entwinedwith totally different series of feeling and thoughts whereas it isunconsciously assumed that principal and victim feel and think exactlyalike and because of this assumption the guilt of the one is based uponthe pain of the other.=The Souls Skin.=--As the bones flesh entrails and blood vessels areenclosed by a skin that renders the aspect of men endurable so theimpulses and passions of the soul are enclosed by vanity: it is the skinof the soul.=Sleep of Virtue.=--If virtue goes to sleep it will be more vigorouswhen it awakes.=Subtlety of Shame.=--Men are not ashamed of obscene thoughts but theyare ashamed when they suspect that obscene thoughts are attributed tothem.=Naughtiness Is Rare.=--Most people are too much absorbed in themselvesto be bad.=The Mite in the Balance.=--We are praised or blamed as the one or theother may be expedient for displaying to advantage our power ofdiscernment.=Luke : Improved.=--He that humbleth himself wisheth to be exalted.=Prevention of Suicide.=--There is a justice according to which we maydeprive a man of life but none that permits us to deprive him of death:this is merely cruelty.=Vanity.=--We set store by the good opinion of men first because it isof use to us and next because we wish to give them pleasure childrentheir parents pupils their teacher and well disposed persons allothers generally. Only when the good opinion of men is important tosomebody apart from personal advantage or the desire to give pleasuredo we speak of vanity. In this last case a man wants to give himselfpleasure but at the expense of his fellow creatures inasmuch as heinspires them with a false opinion of himself or else inspires goodopinion in such a way that it is a source of pain to others byarousing envy. The individual generally seeks through the opinion ofothers to attest and fortify the opinion he has of himself; but thepotent influence of authority--an influence as old as man himself--leadsmany also to strengthen their own opinion of themselves by means ofauthority that is to borrow from others the expedient of relying moreupon the judgment of their fellow men than upon their own.--Interest inoneself the wish to please oneself attains with the vain man suchproportions that he first misleads others into a false unduly exaltedestimate of himself and then relies upon the authority of others for hisself estimate; he thus creates the delusion that he pins his faithto.--It must however be admitted that the vain man does not desire toplease others so much as himself and he will often go so far on thisaccount as to overlook his own interests: for he often inspires hisfellow creatures with malicious envy and renders them ill disposed inorder that he may thus increase his own delight in himself.=Limits of the Love of Mankind.=--Every man who has declared that someother man is an ass or a scoundrel gets angry when the other manconclusively shows that the assertion was erroneous.=Weeping Morality.=--How much delight morality occasions! Think of theocean of pleasing tears that has flowed from the narration of noblegreat-hearted deeds!--This charm of life would disappear if the beliefin complete irresponsibility gained the upper hand.=Origin of Justice.=--Justice reasonableness has its origin amongapproximate equals in power as Thucydides in the dreadful conferencesof the Athenian and Melian envoys has rightly conceived. Thus wherethere exists no demonstrable supremacy and a struggle leads but tomutual useless damage the reflection arises that an understandingwould best be arrived at and some compromise entered into. Thereciprocal nature is hence the first nature of justice. Each party makesthe other content inasmuch as each receives what it prizes more highlythan the other. Each surrenders to the other what the other wants andreceives in return its own desire. Justice is therefore reprisal andexchange upon the basis of an approximate equality of power. Thusrevenge pertains originally to the domain of justice as it is a sort ofreciprocity. Equally so gratitude.--Justice reverts naturally to thestandpoint of self preservation therefore to the egoism of thisconsideration: why should I injure myself to no purpose and perhapsnever attain my end--So much for the origin of justice. Only becausemen through mental habits have forgotten the original motive of socalled just and rational acts and also because for thousands of yearschildren have been brought to admire and imitate such acts have theygradually assumed the appearance of being unegotistical. Upon thisappearance is founded the high estimate of them which moreover likeall estimates is continually developing for whatever is highlyesteemed is striven for imitated made the object of self sacrificewhile the merit of the pain and emulation thus expended is by eachindividual ascribed to the thing esteemed.--How slightly moral wouldthe world appear without forgetfulness! A poet could say that God hadposted forgetfulness as a sentinel at the portal of the temple of humanmerit!=Concerning the Law of the Weaker.=--Whenever any party for instance abesieged city yields to a stronger party under stipulated conditionsthe counter stipulation is that there be a reduction to insignificancea burning and destruction of the city and thus a great damage inflictedupon the stronger party. Thus arises a sort of equalization principleupon the basis of which a law can be established. The enemy has anadvantage to gain by its maintenance.--To this extent there is also alaw between slaves and masters limited only by the extent to which theslave may be useful to his master. The law goes originally only so faras the one party may appear to the other potent invincible stable andthe like. To such an extent then the weaker has rights but verylimited ones. Hence the famous dictum that each has as much law on hisside as his power extends or more accurately as his power is believedto extend.=The Three Phases of Morality Hitherto.=--It is the first evidence thatthe animal has become human when his conduct ceases to be based upon theimmediately expedient but upon the permanently useful; when he hastherefore grown utilitarian capable of purpose. Thus is manifested thefirst rule of reason. A still higher stage is attained when he regulateshis conduct upon the basis of honor by means of which he gains masteryof himself and surrenders his desires to principles; this lifts him farabove the phase in which he was actuated only by considerations ofpersonal advantage as he understood it. He respects and wishes to berespected. This means that he comprehends utility as a thing dependentupon what his opinion of others is and their opinion of him. Finally heregulates his conduct the highest phase of morality hitherto attainedby his own standard of men and things. He himself decides for himselfand for others what is honorable and what is useful. He has become alaw giver to opinion upon the basis of his ever higher developingconception of the utilitarian and the honorable. Knowledge makes himcapable of placing the highest utility that is the universalenduring utility before merely personal utility--of placing ennoblingrecognition of the enduring and universal before the merely temporary:he lives and acts as a collective individuality.=Ethic of the Developed Individual.=--Hitherto the altruistic has beenlooked upon as the distinctive characteristic of moral conduct and itis manifest that it was the consideration of universal utility thatprompted praise and recognition of altruistic conduct. Must not aradical departure from this point of view be imminent now that it isbeing ever more clearly perceived that in the most personalconsiderations the most general welfare is attained: so that conductinspired by the most personal considerations of advantage is just thesort which has its origin in the present conception of morality as auniversal utilitarianism To contemplate oneself as a completepersonality and bear the welfare of that personality in mind in all thatone does--this is productive of better results than any sympatheticsusceptibility and conduct in behalf of others. Indeed we all sufferfrom such disparagement of our own personalities which are at presentmade to deteriorate from neglect. Capacity is in fact divorced fromour personality in most cases and sacrificed to the state to scienceto the needy as if it were the bad which deserved to be made asacrifice. Now we are willing to labor for our fellowmen but only tothe extent that we find our own highest advantage in so doing no moreno less. The whole matter depends upon what may be understood as onesadvantage: the crude undeveloped rough individualities will be thevery ones to estimate it most inadequately.=Usage and Ethic.=--To be moral virtuous praiseworthy means to yieldobedience to ancient law and hereditary usage. Whether this obedience berendered readily or with difficulty is long immaterial. Enough that itbe rendered. Good finally comes to mean him who acts in thetraditional manner as a result of heredity or natural disposition thatis to say does what is customary with scarcely an effort whatever thatmay be for example revenges injuries when revenge as with the ancientGreeks was part of good morals. He is called good because he is goodto some purpose and as benevolence sympathy consideratenessmoderation and the like come in the general course of conduct to befinally recognized as good to some purpose as utilitarian thebenevolent man the helpful man is duly styled good. At first otherand more important kinds of utilitarian qualities stand in theforeground. Bad is not habitual unusual to do things not inaccordance with usage to oppose the traditional however rational orthe reverse the traditional may be. To do injury to ones social groupor community and to ones neighbor as thus understood is looked uponthrough all the variations of moral laws in different ages as thepeculiarly immoral act so that to-day we associate the word badwith deliberate injury to ones neighbor or community. Egoistic andnon-egoistic do not constitute the fundamental opposites that havebrought mankind to make a distinction between moral and immoral goodand bad; but adherence to traditional custom and emancipation from it.How the traditional had its origin is quite immaterial; in any event ithad no reference to good and bad or any categorical imperative but tothe all important end of maintaining and sustaining the community therace the confederation the nation. Every superstitious custom thatoriginated in a misinterpreted event or casualty entailed sometradition to adhere to which is moral. To break loose from it isdangerous more prejudicial to the community than to the individualbecause divinity visits the consequences of impiety and sacrilege uponthe community rather than upon the individual. Now every traditiongrows ever more venerable--the more remote is its origin the moreconfused that origin is. The reverence due to it increases fromgeneration to generation. The tradition finally becomes holy andinspires awe. Thus it is that the precept of piety is a far loftiermorality than that inculcated by altruistic conduct.=Delight in the Moral.=--A potent species of joy and thereby the sourceof morality is custom. The customary is done more easily bettertherefore preferably. A pleasure is felt in it and experience thus showsthat since this practice has held its own it must be good. A manner ormoral that lives and lets live is thus demonstrated advantageousnecessary in contradistinction to all new and not yet adoptedpractices. The custom is therefore the blending of the agreeable and theuseful. Moreover it does not require deliberation. As soon as man canexercise compulsion he exercises it to enforce and establish hiscustoms for they are to him attested lifewisdom. So too a communityof individuals constrains each one of their number to adopt the samemoral or custom. The error herein is this: Because a certain custom hasbeen agreeable to the feelings or at least because it proves a means ofmaintenance this custom must be imperative for it is regarded as theonly thing that can possibly be consistent with well being. The wellbeing of life seems to spring from it alone. This conception of thecustomary as a condition of existence is carried into the slightestdetail of morality. Inasmuch as insight into true causation is quiterestricted in all inferior peoples a superstitious anxiety is felt thateverything be done in due routine. Even when a custom is exceedinglyburdensome it is preserved because of its supposed vital utility. It isnot known that the same degree of satisfaction can be experiencedthrough some other custom and even higher degrees of satisfaction too.But it is fully appreciated that all customs do become more agreeablewith the lapse of time no matter how difficult they may have been foundin the beginning and that even the severest way of life may be rendereda matter of habit and therefore a pleasure.=Pleasure and Social Instinct.=--Through his relations with other menman derives a new species of delight in those pleasurable emotions whichhis own personality affords him; whereby the domain of pleasurableemotions is made infinitely more comprehensive. No doubt he hasinherited many of these feelings from the brutes which palpably feeldelight when they sport with one another as mothers with their young.So too the sexual relations must be taken into account: they makeevery young woman interesting to every young man from the standpoint ofpleasure and conversely. The feeling of pleasure originating in humanrelationships makes men in general better. The delight in common thepleasures enjoyed together heighten one another. The individual feels asense of security. He becomes better natured. Distrust and malicedissolve. For the man feels the sense of benefit and observes the samefeeling in others. Mutual manifestations of pleasure inspire mutualsympathy the sentiment of homogeneity. The same effect is felt also atmutual sufferings in a common danger in stormy weather. Upon such afoundation are built the earliest alliances: the object of which is themutual protection and safety from threatening misfortunes and thewelfare of each individual. And thus the social instinct develops frompleasure.=The Guiltless Nature of So-Called Bad Acts.=--All bad acts areinspired by the impulse to self preservation or more accurately bythe desire for pleasure and for the avoidance of pain in the individual.Thus are they occasioned but they are not therefore bad. Pain selfprepared does not exist except in the brains of the philosophers anymore than pleasure self prepared sympathy in the Schopenhauer sense.In the condition anterior to the state we kill the creature be it manor ape that attempts to pluck the fruit of a tree before we pluck itourselves should we happen to be hungry at the time and making for thattree: as we would do to-day so far as the brute is concerned if wewere wandering in savage regions.--The bad acts which most disturb us atpresent do so because of the erroneous supposition that the one who isguilty of them towards us has a free will in the matter and that it waswithin his discretion not to have done these evil things. This belief indiscretionary power inspires hate thirst for revenge malice theentire perversion of the mental processes whereas we would feel in noway incensed against the brute as we hold it irresponsible. To inflictpain not from the instinct of self preservation but in requital--this isthe consequence of false judgment and is equally a guiltless course ofconduct. The individual can in that condition which is anterior to thestate act with fierceness and violence for the intimidation of anothercreature in order to render his own power more secure as a result ofsuch acts of intimidation. Thus acts the powerful the superior theoriginal state founder who subjugates the weaker. He has the right todo so as the state nowadays assumes the same right or to be moreaccurate there is no right that can conflict with this. A foundationfor all morality can first be laid only when a stronger individuality ora collective individuality for example society the state subjects thesingle personalities hence builds upon their unification andestablishes a bond of union. Morality results from compulsion it isindeed itself one long compulsion to which obedience is rendered inorder that pain may be avoided. At first it is but custom later freeobedience and finally almost instinct. At last it is like everythinghabitual and natural associated with pleasure--and is then calledvirtue.=Shame.=--Shame exists wherever a mystery exists: but this is areligious notion which in the earlier period of human civilization hadgreat vogue. Everywhere there were circumscribed spots to which accesswas denied on account of some divine law except in specialcircumstances. At first these spots were quite extensive inasmuch asstipulated areas could not be trod by the uninitiated who when nearthem felt tremors and anxieties. This sentiment was frequentlytransferred to other relationships for example to sexual relationswhich as the privilege and gateway of mature age must be withdrawnfrom the contemplation of youth for its own advantage: relations whichmany divinities were busy in preserving and sanctifying images of whichdivinities were duly placed in marital chambers as guardians. InTurkish such an apartment is termed a harem or holy thing the same wordalso designating the vestibule of a mosque. So too Kingship isregarded as a centre from which power and brilliance stream forth as amystery to the subjects impregnated with secrecy and shame sentimentsstill quite operative among peoples who in other respects are withoutany shame at all. So too is the whole world of inward states theso-called soul even now for all non-philosophical persons amystery and during countless ages it was looked upon as a somethingof divine origin in direct communion with deity. It is therefore anadytum and occasions shame.=Judge Not.=--Care must be taken in the contemplation of earlier agesthat there be no falling into unjust scornfulness. The injustice inslavery the cruelty in the subjugation of persons and peoples must notbe estimated by our standard. For in that period the instinct of justicewas not so highly developed. Who dare reproach the Genoese Calvin forburning the physician Servetus at the stake It was a proceeding growingout of his convictions. And the Inquisition too had its justification.The only thing is that the prevailing views were false and led to thoseproceedings which seem so cruel to us simply because such views havebecome foreign to us. Besides what is the burning alive of oneindividual compared with eternal hell pains for everybody else And yetthis idea then had hold of all the world without in the least vitiatingwith its frightfulness the other idea of a god. Even we nowadays arehard and merciless to political revolutionists but that is because weare in the habit of believing the state a necessity and hence thecruelty of the proceeding is not so much understood as in the othercases where the points of view are repudiated. The cruelty to animalsshown by children and Italians is due to the same misunderstanding. Theanimal owing to the exigencies of the church catechism is placed toofar below the level of mankind.--Much too that is frightful andinhuman in history and which is almost incredible is rendered lessatrocious by the reflection that the one who commands and the one whoexecutes are different persons. The former does not witness theperformance and hence it makes no strong impression on him. The latterobeys a superior and hence feels no responsibility. Most princes andmilitary chieftains appear through lack of true perception cruel andhard without really being so.--Egoism is not bad because the idea of theneighbor--the word is of Christian origin and does not correspond totruth--is very weak in us and we feel ourselves in regard to him asfree from responsibility as if plants and stones were involved. Thatanother is in suffering must be learned and it can never be whollylearned.=Man Always Does Right.=--We do not blame nature when she sends athunder storm and makes us wet: why then do we term the man who inflictsinjury immoral Because in the latter case we assume a voluntaryruling free will and in the former necessity. But this distinction isa delusion. Moreover even the intentional infliction of injury is notin all circumstances termed immoral. Thus we kill a fly intentionallywithout thinking very much about it simply because its buzzing about isdisagreeable; and we punish a criminal and inflict pain upon him inorder to protect ourselves and society. In the first case it is theindividual who for the sake of preserving himself or in order to sparehimself pain does injury with design: in the second case it is thestate. All ethic deems intentional infliction of injury justified bynecessity; that is when it is a matter of self preservation. But thesetwo points of view are sufficient to explain all bad acts done by man tomen. It is desired to obtain pleasure or avoid pain. In any sense it isa question always of self preservation. Socrates and Plato are right:whatever man does he always does right: that is does what seems to himgood advantageous according to the degree of advancement his intellecthas attained which is always the measure of his rational capacity.=The Inoffensive in Badness.=--Badness has not for its object theinfliction of pain upon others but simply our own satisfaction as forinstance in the case of thirst for vengeance or of nerve excitation.Every act of teasing shows what pleasure is caused by the display ofour power over others and what feelings of delight are experienced inthe sense of domination. Is there then anything immoral in feelingpleasure in the pain of others Is malicious joy devilish asSchopenhauer says In the realm of nature we feel joy in breakingboughs shattering rocks fighting with wild beasts simply to attestour strength thereby. Should not the knowledge that another suffers onour account here in this case make the same kind of act which bythe way arouses no qualms of conscience in us immoral also But if wehad not this knowledge there would be no pleasure in ones ownsuperiority or power for this pleasure is experienced only in thesuffering of another as in the case of teasing. All pleasure is initself neither good nor bad. Whence comes the conviction that oneshould not cause pain in others in order to feel pleasure oneselfSimply from the standpoint of utility that is in consideration of theconsequences of ultimate pain since the injured party or state willdemand satisfaction and revenge. This consideration alone can have ledto the determination to renounce such pleasure.--Sympathy has thesatisfaction of others in view no more than as already stated badnesshas the pain of others in view. For there are at least two perhaps manymore elementary ingredients in personal gratification which enterlargely into our self satisfaction: one of them being the pleasure ofthe emotion of which species is sympathy with tragedy and anotherwhen the impulse is to action being the pleasure of exercising onespower. Should a sufferer be very dear to us we divest ourselves of painby the performance of acts of sympathy.--With the exception of some fewphilosophers men have placed sympathy very low in the rank of moralfeelings: and rightly.=Self Defence.=--If self defence is in general held a validjustification then nearly every manifestation of so called immoralegoism must be justified too. Pain is inflicted robbery or killingdone in order to maintain life or to protect oneself and ward off harm.A man lies when cunning and delusion are valid means of selfpreservation. To injure intentionally when our safety and our existenceare involved or the continuance of our well being is conceded to bemoral. The state itself injures from this motive when it hangscriminals. In unintentional injury the immoral of course can not bepresent as accident alone is involved. But is there any sort ofintentional injury in which our existence and the maintenance of ourwell being be not involved Is there such a thing as injuring fromabsolute badness for example in the case of cruelty If a man does notknow what pain an act occasions that act is not one of wickedness. Thusthe child is not bad to the animal not evil. It disturbs and rends itas if it were one of its playthings. Does a man ever fully know how muchpain an act may cause another As far as our nervous system extends weshield ourselves from pain. If it extended further that is to ourfellow men we would never cause anyone else any pain except in suchcases as we cause it to ourselves when we cut ourselves surgically toheal our ills or strive and trouble ourselves to gain health. Weconclude from analogy that something pains somebody and can inconsequence through recollection and the power of imagination feelpain also. But what a difference there always is between the tooth acheand the pain sympathy that the spectacle of tooth ache occasions!Therefore when injury is inflicted from so called badness the degree ofpain thereby experienced is always unknown to us: in so far however aspleasure is felt in the act a sense of ones own power of ones ownexcitation the act is committed to maintain the well being of theindividual and hence comes under the purview of self defence and lyingfor self preservation. Without pleasure there is no life; the strugglefor pleasure is the struggle for life. Whether the individual shallcarry on this struggle in such a way that he be called good or in such away that he be called bad is something that the standard and thecapacity of his own intellect must determine for him.=Justice that Rewards.=--Whoever has fully understood the doctrine ofabsolute irresponsibility can no longer include the so called rewardingand punishing justice in the idea of justice if the latter be taken tomean that to each be given his due. For he who is punished does notdeserve the punishment. He is used simply as a means to intimidateothers from certain acts. Equally he who is rewarded does not merit thereward. He could not act any differently than he did act. Hence thereward has only the significance of an encouragement to him and othersas a motive for subsequent acts. The praise is called out only to himwho is running in the race and not to him who has arrived at the goal.Something that comes to someone as his own is neither a punishment nor areward. It is given to him from utiliarian considerations without hishaving any claim to it in justice. Hence one must say the wise manpraises not because a good act has been done precisely as was oncesaid: the wise man punishes not because a bad act has been done but inorder that a bad act may not be done. If punishment and reward ceasedthere would cease with them the most powerful incentives to certain actsand away from other acts. The purposes of men demand their continuanceof punishment and reward and inasmuch as punishment and reward blameand praise operate most potently upon vanity these same purposes of menimperatively require the continuance of vanity.=The Water Fall.=--At the sight of a water fall we may opine that in thecountless curves spirations and dashes of the waves we behold freedomof the will and of the impulses. But everything is compulsoryeverything can be mathematically calculated. Thus it is too with humanacts. We would be able to calculate in advance every single action if wewere all knowing as well as every advance in knowledge every delusionevery bad deed. The acting individual himself is held fast in theillusion of volition. If on a sudden the entire movement of the worldstopped short and an all knowing and reasoning intelligence were thereto take advantage of this pause he could foretell the future of everybeing to the remotest ages and indicate the path that would be taken inthe worlds further course. The deception of the acting individual asregards himself the assumption of the freedom of the will is a part ofthis computable mechanism.=Non-Responsibility and Non-Guilt.=--The absolute irresponsibility ofman for his acts and his nature is the bitterest drop in the cup of himwho has knowledge if he be accustomed to behold in responsibility andduty the patent of nobility of his human nature. All his estimatespreferences dislikes are thus made worthless and false. His deepestsentiment with which he honored the sufferer the hero sprang from anerror. He may no longer praise no longer blame for it is irrational toblame and praise nature and necessity. Just as he cherishes thebeautiful work of art but does not praise it as it is incapable ofdoing anything for itself just as he stands in the presence of plantshe must stand in the presence of human conduct his own included. He mayadmire strength beauty capacity therein but he can discern no merit.The chemical process and the conflict of the elements the ordeal ofthe invalid who strives for convalescence are no more merits than thesoul-struggles and extremities in which one is torn this way and that bycontending motives until one finally decides in favor of thestrongest--as the phrase has it although in fact it is the strongestmotive that decides for us. All these motives however whatever finenames we may give them have grown from the same roots in which webelieve the baneful poisons lurk. Between good and bad actions there isno difference in kind but at most in degree. Good acts are sublimatedevil. Bad acts are degraded imbruted good. The very longing of theindividual for self gratification together with the fear of beingdeprived of it obtains satisfaction in all circumstances let theindividual act as he may that is as he must: be it in deeds of vanityrevenge pleasure utility badness cunning be it in deeds of selfsacrifice sympathy or knowledge. The degrees of rational capacitydetermine the direction in which this longing impels: every societyevery individual has constantly present a comparative classification ofbenefits in accordance with which conduct is determined and others arejudged. But this standard perpetually changes. Many acts are called badthat are only stupid because the degree of intelligence that decidedfor them was low. Indeed in a certain sense all acts now are stupidfor the highest degree of human intelligence that has yet been attainedwill in time most certainly be surpassed and then in retrospection allour present conduct and opinion will appear as narrow and petty as wenow deem the conduct and opinion of savage peoples and ages.--Toperceive all these things may occasion profound pain but there isnevertheless a consolation. Such pains are birth pains. The butterflyinsists upon breaking through the cocoon he presses through it tearsit to pieces only to be blinded and confused by the strange light bythe realm of liberty. By such men as are capable of this sadness--howfew there are!--will the first attempt be made to see if humanity mayconvert itself from a thing of morality to a thing of wisdom. The sun ofa new gospel sheds its first ray upon the loftiest height in the soulsof those few: but the clouds are massed there too thicker than everand not far apart are the brightest sunlight and the deepest gloom.Everything is necessity--so says the new knowledge: and this knowledgeis itself necessity. All is guiltlessness and knowledge is the way toinsight into this guiltlessness. If pleasure egoism vanity benecessary to attest the moral phenomena and their richest blooms theinstinct for truth and accuracy of knowledge; if delusion and confusionof the imagination were the only means whereby mankind could graduallylift itself up to this degree of self enlightenment and selfemancipation--who would venture to disparage the means Who would havethe right to feel sad if made aware of the goal to which those pathslead Everything in the domain of ethic is evolved changeabletottering; all things flow it is true--but all things are also in thestream: to their goal. Though within us the hereditary habit oferroneous judgment love hate may be ever dominant yet under theinfluence of awaking knowledge it will ever become weaker: a new habitthat of understanding not-loving not-hating looking from above growsup within us gradually and in the same soil and may perhaps inthousands of years be powerful enough to endow mankind with capacity todevelop the wise guiltless man conscious of guiltlessness asunfailingly as it now developes the unwise irrational guilt-consciousman--that is to say the necessary higher step not the opposite of it.THE RELIGIOUS LIFE.=The Double Contest Against Evil.=--If an evil afflicts us we can eitherso deal with it as to remove its cause or else so deal with it that itseffect upon our feeling is changed: hence look upon the evil as abenefit of which the uses will perhaps first become evident in somesubsequent period. Religion and art and also the metaphysicalphilosophy strive to effect an alteration of the feeling partly by analteration of our judgment respecting the experience for example withthe aid of the dictum whom God loves he chastizes partly by theawakening of a joy in pain in emotion especially whence the art oftragedy had its origin. The more one is disposed to interpret away andjustify the less likely he is to look directly at the causes of eviland eliminate them. An instant alleviation and narcotizing of pain asis usual in the case of tooth ache is sufficient for him even in theseverest suffering. The more the domination of religions and of allnarcotic arts declines the more searchingly do men look to theelimination of evil itself which is a rather bad thing for the tragicpoets--for there is ever less and less material for tragedy since thedomain of unsparing immutable destiny grows constantly morecircumscribed--and a still worse thing for the priests for these lasthave lived heretofore upon the narcoticizing of human ill.=Sorrow is Knowledge.=--How willingly would not one exchange the falseassertions of the homines religiosi that there is a god who commands usto be good who is the sentinel and witness of every act every momentevery thought who loves us who plans our welfare in everymisfortune--how willingly would not one exchange these for truths ashealing beneficial and grateful as those delusions! But there are nosuch truths. Philosophy can at most set up in opposition to them othermetaphysical plausibilities fundamental untruths as well. The tragedyof it all is that although one cannot believe these dogmas of religionand metaphysics if one adopts in heart and head the potent methods oftruth one has yet become through human evolution so tendersusceptible sensitive as to stand in need of the most effective meansof rest and consolation. From this state of things arises the dangerthat through the perception of truth or more accurately seeingthrough delusion one may bleed to death. Byron has put this intodeathless verse:     Sorrow is knowledge: they who know the most     Must mourn the deepest oer the fatal truth     The tree of knowledge is not that of life.Against such cares there is no better protective than the light fancy ofHorace at any rate during the darkest hours and sun eclipses of thesoul expressed in the words     quid aeternis minorem     consiliis animum fatigas     cur non sub alta vel platano vel hac     pinu jacentes. Then wherefore should you who are mortal outwear     Your soul with a profitless burden of care     Say why should we not flung at ease neath this pine     Or a plane-trees broad umbrage quaff gaily our wine                      Translation of Sir Theodore Martin.At any rate light fancy or heavy heartedness of any degree must bebetter than a romantic retrogression and desertion of ones flag anapproach to Christianity in any form: for with it in the present stateof knowledge one can have nothing to do without hopelessly defilingones intellectual integrity and surrendering it unconditionally. Thesewoes may be painful enough but without pain one cannot become a leaderand guide of humanity: and woe to him who would be such and lacks thispure integrity of the intellect!=The Truth in Religion.=--In the ages of enlightenment justice was notdone to the importance of religion of this there can be no doubt. It isalso equally certain that in the ensuing reaction of enlightenment thedemands of justice were far exceeded inasmuch as religion was treatedwith love even with infatuation and proclaimed as a profound indeedthe most profound knowledge of the world which science had but todivest of its dogmatic garb in order to possess truth in itsunmythical form. Religions must therefore--this was the contention ofall foes of enlightenment--sensu allegorico with regard for thecomprehension of the masses give expression to that ancient truth whichis wisdom in itself inasmuch as all science of modern times has led upto it instead of away from it. So that between the most ancient wisdomof man and all later wisdom there prevails harmony even similarity ofviewpoint; and the advancement of knowledge--if one be disposed toconcede such a thing--has to do not with its nature but with itspropagation. This whole conception of religion and science is throughand through erroneous and none would to-day be hardy enough tocountenance it had not Schopenhauers rhetoric taken it underprotection this high sounding rhetoric which now gains auditors afterthe lapse of a generation. Much as may be gained from Schopenhauersreligio-ethical human and cosmical oracle as regards the comprehensionof Christianity and other religions it is nevertheless certain that heerred regarding the value of religion to knowledge. He himself was inthis but a servile pupil of the scientific teachers of his time who hadall taken romanticism under their protection and renounced the spirit ofenlightenment. Had he been born in our own time it would have beenimpossible for him to have spoken of the sensus allegoricus of religion.He would instead have done truth the justice to say: never has areligion directly or indirectly either as dogma or as allegorycontained a truth. For all religions grew out of dread or necessity andcame into existence through an error of the reason. They have perhapsin times of danger from science incorporated some philosophicaldoctrine or other into their systems in order to make it possible tocontinue ones existence within them. But this is but a theological workof art dating from the time in which a religion began to doubt ofitself. These theological feats of art which are most common inChristianity as the religion of a learned age impregnated withphilosophy have led to this superstition of the sensus allegoricus ashas even more the habit of the philosophers namely thosehalf-natures the poetical philosophers and the philosophising artistsof dealing with their own feelings as if they constituted thefundamental nature of humanity and hence of giving their own religiousfeelings a predominant influence over the structure of their systems. Asthe philosophers mostly philosophised under the influence of hereditaryreligious habits or at least under the traditional influence of thismetaphysical necessity they naturally arrived at conclusionsclosely resembling the Judaic or Christian or Indian religioustenets--resembling in the way that children are apt to look like theirmothers: only in this case the fathers were not certain as to thematernity as easily happens--but in the innocence of their admirationthey fabled regarding the family likeness of all religion and science.In reality there exists between religion and true science neitherrelationship nor friendship not even enmity: they dwell in differentspheres. Every philosophy that lets the religious comet gleam throughthe darkness of its last outposts renders everything within it thatpurports to be science suspicious. It is all probably religionalthough it may assume the guise of science.--Moreover though all thepeoples agree concerning certain religious things for example theexistence of a god which by the way as regards this point is notthe case this fact would constitute an argument against the thingagreed upon for example the very existence of a god. The consensusgentium and especially hominum can probably amount only to an absurdity.Against it there is no consensus omnium sapientium whatever on anypoint with the exception of which Goethes verse speaks:     All greatest sages to all latest ages         Will smile wink and slily agree     Tis folly to wait till a fools empty pate         Has learned to be knowing and free.     So children of wisdom must look upon fools     As creatures whore never the better for schools.Stated without rhyme or metre and adapted to our case: the consensussapientium is to the effect that the consensus gentium amounts to anabsurdity.=Origin of Religious Worship.=--Let us transport ourselves back to thetimes in which religious life flourished most vigorously and we willfind a fundamental conviction prevalent which we no longer share andwhich has resulted in the closing of the door to religious life once forall so far as we are concerned: this conviction has to do with natureand intercourse with her. In those times nothing is yet known ofnatures laws. Neither for earth nor for heaven is there a must. Aseason sunshine rain can come or stay away as it pleases. There iswanting in particular all idea of natural causation. If a man rows itis not the oar that moves the boat but rowing is a magical ceremonywhereby a demon is constrained to move the boat. All illness deathitself is a consequence of magical influences. In sickness and deathnothing natural is conceived. The whole idea of natural course iswanting. The idea dawns first upon the ancient Greeks that is to say ina very late period of humanity in the conception of a Moira fateruling over the gods. If any person shoots off a bow there is always anirrational strength and agency in the act. If the wells suddenly rundry the first thought is of subterranean demons and their pranks. Itmust have been the dart of a god beneath whose invisible influence ahuman being suddenly collapses. In India the carpenter according toLubbock is in the habit of making devout offerings to his hammer andhatchet. A Brahmin treats the plume with which he writes a soldier theweapon that he takes into the field a mason his trowel a laborer hisplow in the same way. All nature is in the opinion of religiouspeople a sum total of the doings of conscious and willing beings animmense mass of complex volitions. In regard to all that takes placeoutside of us no conclusion is permissible that anything will resultthus and so must result thus and so that we are comparativelycalculable and certain in our experiences that man is the rule naturethe ruleless. This view forms the fundamental conviction that dominatescrude religion-producing early civilizations. We contemporary men feelexactly the opposite: the richer man now feels himself inwardly themore polyphone the music and the sounding of his soul the morepowerfully does the uniformity of nature impress him. We all withGoethe recognize in nature the great means of repose for the soul. Welisten to the pendulum stroke of this great clock with longing for restfor absolute calm and quiescence as if we could drink in the uniformityof nature and thereby arrive first at an enjoyment of oneself. Formerlyit was the reverse: if we carry ourselves back to the periods of crudecivilization or if we contemplate contemporary savages we will findthem most strongly influenced by rule by tradition. The individual isalmost automatically bound to rule and tradition and moves with theuniformity of a pendulum. To him nature--the uncomprehended fearfulmysterious nature--must seem the domain of freedom of volition ofhigher power indeed as an ultra-human degree of destiny as god. Everyindividual in such periods and circumstances feels that his existencehis happiness the existence and happiness of the family the statethe success or failure of every undertaking must depend upon thesedispositions of nature. Certain natural events must occur at the propertime and certain others must not occur. How can influence be exercisedover this fearful unknown how can this domain of freedom be broughtunder subjection thus he asks himself thus he worries: Is there nomeans to render these powers of nature as subject to rule and traditionas you are yourself--The cogitation of the superstitious andmagic-deluded man is upon the theme of imposing a law upon nature: andto put it briefly religious worship is the result of such cogitation.The problem which is present to every man is closely connected with thisone: how can the weaker party dictate laws to the stronger control itsacts in reference to the weaker At first the most harmless form ofinfluence is recollected that influence which is acquired when thepartiality of anyone has been won. Through beseeching and prayerthrough abject humiliation through obligations to regular gifts andpropitiations through flattering homages it is possible therefore toimpose some guidance upon the forces of nature to the extent that theirpartiality be won: love binds and is bound. Then agreements can beentered into by means of which certain courses of conduct are mutuallyconcluded vows are made and authorities prescribed. But far more potentis that species of power exercised by means of magic and incantation. Asa man is able to injure a powerful enemy by means of the magician andrender him helpless with fear as the love potion operates at adistance so can the mighty forces of nature in the opinion of weakermankind be controlled by similar means. The principal means ofeffecting incantations is to acquire control of something belonging tothe party to be influenced hair finger nails food from his tableeven his picture or his name. With such apparatus it is possible to actby means of magic for the basic principle is that to everythingspiritual corresponds something corporeal. With the aid of thiscorporeal element the spirit may be bound injured or destroyed. Thecorporeal affords the handle by which the spiritual can be laid hold of.In the same way that man influences mankind does he influences somespirit of nature for this latter has also its corporeal element thatcan be grasped. The tree and on the same basis the seed from which itgrew: this puzzling sequence seems to demonstrate that in both forms thesame spirit is embodied now large now small. A stone that suddenlyrolls is the body in which the spirit works. Does a huge boulder lie ina lonely moor It is impossible to think of mortal power having placedit there. The stone must have moved itself there. That is to say somespirit must dominate it. Everything that has a body is subject to magicincluding therefore the spirits of nature. If a god is directlyconnected with his portrait a direct influence by refraining fromdevout offerings by whippings chainings and the like can be broughtto bear upon him. The lower classes in China tie cords around thepicture of their god in order to defy his departing favor when he hasleft them in the lurch and tear the picture to pieces drag it throughthe streets into dung heaps and gutters crying: You dog of a spiritwe housed you in a beautiful temple we gilded you prettily we fed youwell we brought you offerings and yet how ungrateful you are! Similardisplays of resentment have been made against pictures of the mother ofgod and pictures of saints in Catholic countries during the presentcentury when such pictures would not do their duty during times ofpestilence and drought.Through all these magical relationships to nature countless ceremoniesare occasioned and finally when their complexity and confusion growtoo great pains are taken to systematize them to arrange them so thatthe favorable course of natures progress namely the great yearlycircle of the seasons may be brought about by a corresponding course ofthe ceremonial progress. The aim of religious worship is to influencenature to human advantage and hence to instil a subjection to law intoher that originally she has not whereas at present man desires to findout the subjection to law of nature in order to guide himself thereby.In brief the system of religious worship rests upon the idea of magicbetween man and man and the magician is older than the priest. But itrests equally upon other and higher ideas. It brings into prominence thesympathetic relation of man to man the existence of benevolencegratitude prayer of truces between enemies of loans upon security ofarrangements for the protection of property. Man even in very inferiordegrees of civilization does not stand in the presence of nature as ahelpless slave he is not willy-nilly the absolute servant of nature. Inthe Greek development of religion especially in the relationship to theOlympian gods it becomes possible to entertain the idea of an existenceside by side of two castes a higher more powerful and a lower lesspowerful: but both are bound together in some way on account of theirorigin and are one species. They need not be ashamed of one another.This is the element of distinction in Greek religion.=At the Contemplation of Certain Ancient Sacrificial Proceedings.=--Howmany sentiments are lost to us is manifest in the union of the farcicaleven of the obscene with the religious feeling. The feeling that thismixture is possible is becoming extinct. We realize the mixture onlyhistorically in the mysteries of Demeter and Dionysos and in theChristian Easter festivals and religious mysteries. But we stillperceive the sublime in connection with the ridiculous and the likethe emotional with the absurd. Perhaps a later age will be unable tounderstand even these combinations.=Christianity as Antiquity.=--When on a Sunday morning we hear the oldbells ringing we ask ourselves: Is it possible All this for a Jewcrucified two thousand years ago who said he was Gods son The proof ofsuch an assertion is lacking.--Certainly the Christian religionconstitutes in our time a protruding bit of antiquity from very remoteages and that its assertions are still generally believed--although menhave become so keen in the scrutiny of claims--constitutes the oldestrelic of this inheritance. A god who begets children by a mortal woman;a sage who demands that no more work be done that no more justice beadministered but that the signs of the approaching end of the world beheeded; a system of justice that accepts an innocent as a vicarioussacrifice in the place of the guilty; a person who bids his disciplesdrink his blood; prayers for miracles; sins against a god expiated upona god; fear of a hereafter to which death is the portal; the figure ofthe cross as a symbol in an age that no longer knows the purpose and theignominy of the cross--how ghostly all these things flit before us outof the grave of their primitive antiquity! Is one to believe that suchthings can still be believed=The Un-Greek in Christianity.=--The Greeks did not look upon theHomeric gods above them as lords nor upon themselves beneath asservants after the fashion of the Jews. They saw but the counterpart asin a mirror of the most perfect specimens of their own caste hence anideal but no contradiction of their own nature. There was a feeling ofmutual relationship resulting in a mutual interest a sort of alliance.Man thinks well of himself when he gives himself such gods and placeshimself in a relationship akin to that of the lower nobility with thehigher; whereas the Italian races have a decidedly vulgar religioninvolving perpetual anxiety because of bad and mischievous powers andsoul disturbers. Wherever the Olympian gods receded into the backgroundthere even Greek life became gloomier and more perturbed.--Christianityon the other hand oppressed and degraded humanity completely and sankit into deepest mire: into the feeling of utter abasement it suddenlyflashed the gleam of divine compassion so that the amazed andgrace-dazzled stupefied one gave a cry of delight and for a momentbelieved that the whole of heaven was within him. Upon this unhealthyexcess of feeling upon the accompanying corruption of heart and headChristianity attains all its psychological effects. It wants toannihilate debase stupefy amaze bedazzle. There is but one thingthat it does not want: measure standard das Maas and therefore is itin the worst sense barbarous asiatic vulgar un-Greek.=Being Religious to Some Purpose.=--There are certain insipidtraffic-virtuous people to whom religion is pinned like the hem of somegarb of a higher humanity. These people do well to remain religious: itadorns them. All who are not versed in some professionalweapon--including tongue and pen as weapons--are servile: to all suchthe Christian religion is very useful for then their servility assumesthe aspect of Christian virtue and is amazingly adorned.--People whosedaily lives are empty and colorless are readily religious. This iscomprehensible and pardonable but they have no right to demand thatothers whose daily lives are not empty and colorless should bereligious also.=The Everyday Christian.=--If Christianity with its allegations of anavenging God universal sinfulness choice of grace and the danger ofeternal damnation were true it would be an indication of weakness ofmind and character not to be a priest or an apostle or a hermit andtoil for ones own salvation. It would be irrational to lose sight ofones eternal well being in comparison with temporary advantage:Assuming these dogmas to be generally believed the every day Christianis a pitiable figure a man who really cannot count as far as three andwho for the rest just because of his intellectual incapacity does notdeserve to be as hard punished as Christianity promises he shall be.=Concerning the Cleverness of Christianity.=--It is a master stroke ofChristianity to so emphasize the unworthiness sinfulness anddegradation of men in general that contempt of ones fellow creaturesbecomes impossible. He may sin as much as he pleases he is not bynature different from me. It is I who in every way am unworthy andcontemptible. So says the Christian to himself. But even this feelinghas lost its keenest sting for the Christian does not believe in hisindividual degradation. He is bad in his general human capacity and hesoothes himself a little with the assertion that we are all alike.=Personal Change.=--As soon as a religion rules it has for itsopponents those who were its first disciples.=Fate of Christianity.=--Christianity arose to lighten the heart butnow it must first make the heart heavy in order to be able to lighten itafterwards. Christianity will consequently go down.=The Testimony of Pleasure.=--The agreeable opinion is accepted as true.This is the testimony of pleasure or as the church says the evidenceof strength of which all religions are so proud although they shouldall be ashamed of it. If a belief did not make blessed it would not bebelieved. How little it would be worth then!=Dangerous Play.=--Whoever gives religious feeling room must then alsolet it grow. He can do nothing else. Then his being gradually changes.The religious element brings with it affinities and kinships. The wholecircle of his judgment and feeling is clouded and draped in religiousshadows. Feeling cannot stand still. One should be on ones guard.=The Blind Pupil.=--As long as one knows very well the strength and theweakness of ones dogma ones art ones religion its strength isstill low. The pupil and apostle who has no eye for the weaknesses of adogma a religion and so on dazzled by the aspect of the master and byhis own reverence for him has on that very account generally morepower than the master. Without blind pupils the influence of a man andhis work has never become great. To give victory to knowledge oftenamounts to no more than so allying it with stupidity that the bruteforce of the latter forces triumph for the former.=The Breaking off of Churches.=--There is not sufficient religion in theworld merely to put an end to the number of religions.=Sinlessness of Men.=--If one have understood how Sin came into theworld namely through errors of the reason through which men in theirintercourse with one another and even individual men looked uponthemselves as much blacker and wickeder than was really the case oneswhole feeling is much lightened and man and the world appear together insuch a halo of harmlessness that a sentiment of well being is instilledinto ones whole nature. Man in the midst of nature is as a child leftto its own devices. This child indeed dreams a heavy anxious dream. Butwhen it opens its eyes it finds itself always in paradise.=Irreligiousness of Artists.=--Homer is so much at home among his godsand is as a poet so good natured to them that he must have beenprofoundly irreligious. That which was brought to him by the popularfaith--a mean crude and partially repulsive superstition--he dealt withas freely as the Sculptor with his clay therefore with the same freedomthat Ã†schylus and Aristophanes evinced and with which in later times thegreat artists of the renaissance and also Shakespeare and Goethe drewtheir pictures.=Art and Strength of False Interpretation.=--All the visions fearsexhaustions and delights of the saint are well known symptoms ofsickness which in him owing to deep rooted religious and psychologicaldelusions are explained quite differently that is not as symptoms ofsickness.--So too perhaps the demon of Socrates was nothing but amalady of the ear that he explained in view of his predominant moraltheory in a manner different from what would be thought rationalto-day. Nor is the case different with the frenzy and the frenziedspeeches of the prophets and of the priests of the oracles. It is alwaysthe degree of wisdom imagination capacity and morality in the heartand mind of the interpreters that got so much out of them. It is amongthe greatest feats of the men who are called geniuses and saints thatthey made interpreters for themselves who fortunately for mankind didnot understand them.=Reverence for Madness.=--Because it was perceived that an excitement ofsome kind often made the head clearer and occasioned fortunateinspirations it was concluded that the utmost excitement would occasionthe most fortunate inspirations. Hence the frenzied being was revered asa sage and an oracle giver. A false conclusion lies at the bottom of allthis.=Promises of Wisdom.=--Modern science has as its object as little painas possible as long a life as possible--hence a sort of eternalblessedness but of a very limited kind in comparison with the promisesof religion.=Forbidden Generosity.=--There is not enough of love and goodness in theworld to throw any of it away on conceited people.=Survival of Religious Training in the Disposition.=--The CatholicChurch and before it all ancient education controlled the whole domainof means through which man was put into certain unordinary moods andwithdrawn from the cold calculation of personal advantage and from calmrational reflection. A church vibrating with deep tones; gloomyregular restraining exhortations from a priestly band whoinvoluntarily communicate their own tension to their congregation andlead them to listen almost with anxiety as if some miracle were incourse of preparation; the awesome pile of architecture which as thehouse of a god rears itself vastly into the vague and in all itsshadowy nooks inspires fear of its nerve-exciting power--who would careto reduce men to the level of these things if the ideas upon which theyrest became extinct But the results of all these things arenevertheless not thrown away: the inner world of exalted emotionalprophetic profoundly repentant hope-blessed moods has become inborn inman largely through cultivation. What still exists in his soul wasformerly as he germinated grew and bloomed thoroughly disciplined.=Religious After-Pains.=--Though one believe oneself absolutely weanedaway from religion the process has yet not been so thorough as to makeimpossible a feeling of joy at the presence of religious feelings anddispositions without intelligible content as for example in music;and if a philosophy alleges to us the validity of metaphysical hopesthrough the peace of soul therein attainable and also speaks of thewhole true gospel in the look of Raphaels Madonna we greet suchdeclarations and innuendoes with a welcome smile. The philosopher hashere a matter easy of demonstration. He responds with that which he isglad to give namely a heart that is glad to accept. Hence it isobservable how the less reflective free spirits collide only with dogmasbut yield readily to the magic of religious feelings; it is a source ofpain to them to let the latter go simply on account of theformer.--Scientific philosophy must be very much on its guard lest onaccount of this necessity--an evolved and hence also a transitorynecessity--delusions are smuggled in. Even logicians speak ofpresentiments of truth in ethics and in art for example of thepresentiment that the essence of things is unity a thing whichnevertheless ought to be prohibited. Between carefully deduced truthsand such foreboded things there lies the abysmal distinction that theformer are products of the intellect and the latter of the necessity.Hunger is no evidence that there is food at hand to appease it. Hungermerely craves food. Presentiment does not denote that the existence ofa thing is known in any way whatever. It denotes merely that it isdeemed possible to the extent that it is desired or feared. Thepresentiment is not one step forward in the domain of certainty.--Itis involuntarily believed that the religious tinted sections of aphilosophy are better attested than the others but the case is atbottom just the opposite: there is simply the inner wish that it may beso that the thing which beautifies may also be true. This wish leads usto accept bad grounds as good.=Of the Christian Need of Salvation.=--Careful consideration must renderit possible to propound some explanation of that process in the soul ofa Christian which is termed need of salvation and to propound anexplanation too free from mythology: hence one purely psychological.Heretofore psychological explanations of religious conditions andprocesses have really been in disrepute inasmuch as a theology callingitself free gave vent to its unprofitable nature in this domain; for itsprincipal aim so far as may be judged from the spirit of its creatorSchleier-macher was the preservation of the Christian religion and themaintenance of the Christian theology. It appeared that in thepsychological analysis of religious facts a new anchorage and aboveall a new calling were to be gained. Undisturbed by such predecessorswe venture the following exposition of the phenomena alluded to. Man isconscious of certain acts which are very firmly implanted in the generalcourse of conduct: indeed he discovers in himself a predisposition tosuch acts that seems to him to be as unalterable as his very being. Howgladly he would essay some other kind of acts which in the generalestimate of conduct are rated the best and highest how gladly he wouldwelcome the consciousness of well doing which ought to follow unselfishmotive! Unfortunately however it goes no further than this longing:the discontent consequent upon being unable to satisfy it is added toall other kinds of discontent which result from his life destiny inparticular or which may be due to so called bad acts; so that a deepdepression ensues accompanied by a desire for some physician to removeit and all its causes.--This condition would not be found so bitter ifthe individual but compared himself freely with other men: for then hewould have no reason to be discontented with himself in particular as heis merely bearing his share of the general burden of human discontentand incompleteness. But he compares himself with a being who alone mustbe capable of the conduct that is called unegoistic and of an enduringconsciousness of unselfish motive with God. It is because he gazes intothis clear mirror that his own self seems so extraordinarily distractedand so troubled. Thereupon the thought of that being in so far as itflits before his fancy as retributive justice occasions him anxiety. Inevery conceivable small and great experience he believes he sees theanger of the being his threats the very implements and manacles of hisjudge and prison. What succors him in this danger which in theprospect of an eternal duration of punishment transcends in hideousnessall the horrors that can be presented to the imaginationBefore we consider this condition in its further effects we would admitto ourselves that man is betrayed into this condition not through hisfault and sin but through a series of delusions of the reason; thatit was the fault of the mirror if his own self appeared to him in thehighest degree dark and hateful and that that mirror was his own workthe very imperfect work of human imagination and judgment. In the firstplace a being capable of absolutely unegoistic conduct is as fabulous asthe phoenix. Such a being is not even thinkable for the very reason thatthe whole notion of unegoistic conduct when closely examinedvanishes into air. Never yet has a man done anything solely for othersand entirely without reference to a personal motive; indeed how could hepossibly do anything that had no reference to himself that is withoutinward compulsion which must always have its basis in a personal needHow could the ego act without ego--A god who on the other hand isall love as he is usually represented would not be capable of asolitary unegoistic act: whence one is reminded of a reflection ofLichtenbergs which is in truth taken from a lower sphere: We cannotpossibly feel for others as the expression goes; we feel only forourselves. The assertion sounds hard but it is not if rightlyunderstood. A man loves neither his father nor his mother nor his wifenor his child but simply the feelings which they inspire. Or as LaRochefoucauld says: If you think you love your mistress for the merelove of her you are very much mistaken. Why acts of love are morehighly prized than others namely not on account of their nature but onaccount of their utility has already been explained in the section onthe origin of moral feelings. But if a man should wish to be all lovelike the god aforesaid and want to do all things for others and nothingfor himself the procedure would be fundamentally impossible because he_must_ do a great deal for himself before there would be any possibilityof doing anything for the love of others. It is also essential thatothers be sufficiently egoistic to accept always and at all times thisself sacrifice and living for others so that the men of love and selfsacrifice have an interest in the survival of unloving and selfishegoists while the highest morality in order to maintain itself mustformally enforce the existence of immorality wherein it would be reallydestroying itself.--Further: the idea of a god perturbs and discouragesas long as it is accepted but as to how it originated can no longer inthe present state of comparative ethnological science be a matter ofdoubt and with the insight into the origin of this belief all faithcollapses. What happens to the Christian who compares his nature withthat of God is exactly what happened to Don Quixote who depreciated hisown prowess because his head was filled with the wondrous deeds of theheroes of chivalrous romance. The standard of measurement which bothemploy belongs to the domain of fable.--But if the idea of Godcollapses so too does the feeling of sin as a violation of divinerescript as a stain upon a god-like creation. There still apparentlyremains that discouragement which is closely allied with fear of thepunishment of worldly justice or of the contempt of ones fellow men.The keenest thorn in the sentiment of sin is dulled when it is perceivedthat ones acts have contravened human tradition human rules and humanlaws without having thereby endangered the eternal salvation of thesoul and its relations with deity. If finally men attain to theconviction of the absolute necessity of all acts and of their utterirresponsibility and then absorb it into their flesh and blood everyrelic of conscience pangs will disappear.If now as stated the Christian through certain delusive feelings isbetrayed into self contempt that is by a false and unscientific view ofhis acts and feelings he must nevertheless perceive with the utmostamazement that this state of self contempt of conscience pangs ofdespair in particular does not last that there are hours during whichall these things are wafted away from the soul and he feels himself oncemore free and courageous. The truth is that joy in his own being thefulness of his own powers in connection with the inevitable decline ofhis profound excitation with the lapse of time bore off the palm ofvictory. The man loves himself once more he feels it--but this very newlove this new self esteem seems to him incredible. He can see in itonly the wholly unmerited stream of the light of grace shed down uponhim. If he formerly saw in every event merely warnings threatspunishments and every kind of indication of divine anger he now readsinto his experiences the grace of god. The latter circumstance seems tohim full of love the former as a helpful pointing of the way and hisentirely joyful frame of mind now seems to him to be an absolute proofof the goodness of God. As formerly in his states of discouragement heinterpreted his conduct falsely so now he does the same with hisexperiences. His state of consolation is now regarded as the effectproduced by some external power. The love with which at bottom heloves himself seems to be the divine love. That which he calls graceand the preliminary of salvation is in reality self-graceself-salvation.Therefore a certain false psychology a certain kind of imaginativenessin the interpretation of motives and experiences is the essentialpreliminary to being a Christian and to experiencing the need ofsalvation. Upon gaining an insight into this wandering of the reason andthe imagination one ceases to be a Christian.=Of Christian Asceticism and Sanctity.=--Much as some thinkers haveexerted themselves to impart an air of the miraculous to those singularphenomena known as asceticism and sanctity to question which or toaccount for which upon a rational basis would be wickedness andsacrilege the temptation to this wickedness is none the less great. Apowerful impulse of nature has in every age led to protest against suchphenomena. At any rate science inasmuch as it is the imitation ofnature permits the casting of doubts upon the inexplicable characterand the supernal degree of such phenomena. It is true that heretoforescience has not succeeded in its attempts at explanation. The phenomenaremain unexplained still to the great satisfaction of those who reveremoral miracles. For speaking generally the unexplained must rank asthe inexplicable the inexplicable as the non-natural supernaturalmiraculous--so runs the demand in the souls of all the religious and allthe metaphysicians even the artists if they happen to be thinkerswhereas the scientific man sees in this demand the evilprinciple.--The universal first apparent truth that is encountered inthe contemplation of sanctity and asceticism is that their nature iscomplicated; for nearly always within the physical world as well as inthe moral the apparently miraculous may be traced successfully to thecomplex the obscure the multi-conditioned. Let us venture then toisolate a few impulses in the soul of the saint and the ascetic toconsider them separately and then view them as a synthetic development.There is an obstinacy against oneself certain sublimated forms of whichare included in asceticism. Certain kinds of men are under such a strongnecessity of exercising their power and dominating impulses that ifother objects are lacking or if they have not succeeded with otherobjects they will actually tyrannize over some portions of their ownnature or over sections and stages of their own personality. Thus domany thinkers bring themselves to views which are far from likely toincrease or improve their fame. Many deliberately bring down thecontempt of others upon themselves although they could easily haveretained consideration by silence. Others contradict earlier opinionsand do not shrink from the ordeal of being deemed inconsistent. On thecontrary they strive for this and act like eager riders who enjoyhorseback exercise most when the horse is skittish. Thus will men indangerous paths ascend to the highest steeps in order to laugh to scorntheir own fear and their own trembling limbs. Thus will the philosopherembrace the dogmas of asceticism humility sanctity in the light ofwhich his own image appears in its most hideous aspect. This crushing ofself this mockery of ones own nature this spernere se sperni out ofwhich religions have made so much is in reality but a very highdevelopment of vanity. The whole ethic of the sermon on the mountbelongs in this category: man has a true delight in mastering himselfthrough exaggerated pretensions or excessive expedients and laterdeifying this tyrannically exacting something within him. In everyscheme of ascetic ethics man prays to one part of himself as if it weregod and hence it is necessary for him to treat the rest of himself asdevil.=Man is Not at All Hours Equally Moral=; this is established. If onesmorality be judged according to ones capacity for great selfsacrificing resolutions and abnegations which when continual and madea habit are known as sanctity one is in affection or disposition themost moral: while higher excitement supplies wholly new impulses whichwere one calm and cool as ordinarily one would not deem oneself evencapable of. How comes this Apparently from the propinquity of all greatand lofty emotional states. If a man is brought to an extraordinarypitch of feeling he can resolve upon a fearful revenge or upon a fearfulrenunciation of his thirst for vengeance indifferently. He craves underthe influences of powerful emotion the great the powerful theimmense and if he chances to perceive that the sacrifice of himselfwill afford him as much satisfaction as the sacrifice of another orwill afford him more he will choose self sacrifice. What concerns himparticularly is simply the unloading of his emotion. Hence he readilyto relieve his tension grasps the darts of the enemy and buries them inhis own breast. That in self abnegation and not in revenge the elementof greatness consisted must have been brought home to mankind only afterlong habituation. A god who sacrifices himself would be the mostpowerful and most effective symbol of this sort of greatness. As theconquest of the most hardly conquered enemy the sudden mastering of apassion--thus does such abnegation _appear_: hence it passes for thesummit of morality. In reality all that is involved is the exchange ofone idea for another whilst the temperament remained at a like altitudea like tidal state. Men when coming out of the spell or resting fromsuch passionate excitation no longer understand the morality of suchinstants but the admiration of all who participated in the occasionsustains them. Pride is their support if the passion and thecomprehension of their act weaken. Therefore at bottom even such actsof self-abnegation are not moral inasmuch as they are not done with astrict regard for others. Rather do others afford the high strungtemperament an opportunity to lighten itself through such abnegation.=Even the Ascetic Seeks to Make Life Easier= and generally by means ofabsolute subjection to another will or to an all inclusive rule andritual pretty much as the Brahmin leaves absolutely nothing to his ownvolition but is guided in every moment of his life by some holyinjunction or other. This subjection is a potent means of acquiringdominion over oneself. One is occupied hence time does not bang heavyand there is no incitement of the personal will and of the individualpassion. The deed once done there is no feeling of responsibility northe sting of regret. One has given up ones own will once for all andthis is easier than to give it up occasionally as it is also easierwholly to renounce a desire than to yield to it in measured degree. Whenwe consider the present relation of man to the state we perceiveunconditional obedience is easier than conditional. The holy person alsomakes his lot easier through the complete surrender of his lifepersonality and it is all delusion to admire such a phenomenon as theloftiest heroism of morality. It is always more difficult to assertones personality without shrinking and without hesitation than to giveit up altogether in the manner indicated and it requires moreover moreintellect and thought.After having discovered in many of the less comprehensible actions meremanifestations of pleasure in emotion for its own sake I fancy I candetect in the self contempt which characterises holy persons and alsoin their acts of self torture through hunger and scourgingsdistortions and chaining of the limbs acts of madness simply a meanswhereby such natures may resist the general exhaustion of their will tolive their nerves. They employ the most painful expedients to escapeif only for a time from the heaviness and weariness in which they aresteeped by their great mental indolence and their subjection to a willother than their own.=The Most Usual Means= by which the ascetic and the sanctifiedindividual seeks to make life more endurable comprises certain combatsof an inner nature involving alternations of victory and prostration.For this purpose an enemy is necessary and he is found in the so calledinner enemy. That is the holy individual makes use of his tendency tovanity domineering and pride and of his mental longings in order tocontemplate his life as a sort of continuous battle and himself as abattlefield in which good and evil spirits wage war with varyingfortune. It is an established fact that the imagination is restrainedthrough the regularity and adequacy of sexual intercourse while on theother hand abstention from or great irregularity in sexual intercoursewill cause the imagination to run riot. The imaginations of many of theChristian saints were obscene to a degree; and because of the theorythat sexual desires were in reality demons that raged within them thesaints did not feel wholly responsible for them. It is to thisconviction that we are indebted for the highly instructive sincerity oftheir evidence against themselves. It was to their interest that thiscontest should always be kept up in some fashion because by means ofthis contest as already stated their empty lives gained distraction.In order that the contest might seem sufficiently great to inspiresympathy and admiration in the unsanctified it was essential thatsexual capacity be ever more and more damned and denounced. Indeed thedanger of eternal damnation was so closely allied to this capacity thatfor whole generations Christians showed their children with actualconscience pangs. What evil may not have been done to humanity throughthis! And yet here the truth is just upside down: an exceedinglyunseemly attitude for the truth. Christianity it is true had said thatevery man is conceived and born in sin and in the intolerable andexcessive Christianity of Calderon this thought is again perverted andentangled into the most distorted paradox extant in the well known lines     The greatest sin of man     Is the sin of being born.In all pessimistic religions the act of procreation is looked upon asevil in itself. This is far from being the general human opinion. It isnot even the opinion of all pessimists. Empedocles for example knowsnothing of anything shameful devilish and sinful in it. He sees ratherin the great field of bliss of unholiness simply a healthful and hopefulphenomenon Aphrodite. She is to him an evidence that strife does notalways rage but that some time a gentle demon is to wield the sceptre.The Christian pessimists of practice had as stated a direct interestin the prevalence of an opposite belief. They needed in the lonelinessand the spiritual wilderness of their lives an ever living enemy and auniversally known enemy through whose conquest they might appear to theunsanctified as utterly incomprehensible and half unnatural beings. Whenthis enemy at last as a result of their mode of life and theirshattered health took flight forever they were able immediately topeople their inner selves with new demons. The rise and fall of thebalance of cheerfulness and despair maintained their addled brains in atotally new fluctuation of longing and peace of soul. And in that periodpsychology served not only to cast suspicion on everything human but towound and scourge it to crucify it. Man wanted to find himself as baseand evil as possible. Man sought to become anxious about the state ofhis soul he wished to be doubtful of his own capacity. Everythingnatural with which man connects the idea of badness and sinfulness asfor instance is still customary in regard to the erotic injures anddegrades the imagination occasions a shamed aspect leads man to warupon himself and makes him uncertain distrustful of himself. Even hisdreams acquire a tincture of the unclean conscience. And yet thissuffering because of the natural element in certain things is whollysuperfluous. It is simply the result of opinions regarding the things.It is easy to understand why men become worse than they are if they arebrought to look upon the unavoidably natural as bad and later to feel itas of evil origin. It is the master stroke of religions and metaphysicsthat wish to make man out bad and sinful by nature to render naturesuspicious in his eyes and to so make himself evil for he learns tofeel himself evil when he cannot divest himself of nature. He graduallycomes to look upon himself after a long life lived naturally sooppressed by a weight of sin that supernatural powers become necessaryto relieve him of the burden; and with this notion comes the so calledneed of salvation which is the result not of a real but of an imaginarysinfulness. Go through the separate moral expositions in the vouchers ofchristianity and it will always be found that the demands are excessivein order that it may be impossible for man to satisfy them. The objectis not that he may become moral but that he may feel as sinful aspossible. If this feeling had not been rendered agreeable to man--whyshould he have improvised such an ideal and clung to it so long As inthe ancient world an incalculable strength of intellect and capacity forfeeling was squandered in order to increase the joy of living throughfeastful systems of worship so in the era of christianity an equallyincalculable quantity of intellectual capacity has been sacrificed inanother endeavor: that man should in every way feel himself sinful andthereby be moved inspired inspirited. To move to inspire to inspiritat any cost--is not this the freedom cry of an exhausted over-ripeover cultivated age The circle of all the natural sensations had beengone through a hundred times: the soul had grown weary. Then the saintsand the ascetics found a new order of ecstacies. They set themselvesbefore the eyes of all not alone as models for imitation to many but asfearful and yet delightful spectacles on the boundary line between thisworld and the next world where in that period everyone thought he sawat one time rays of heavenly light at another fearful threateningtongues of flame. The eye of the saint directed upon the fearfulsignificance of the shortness of earthly life upon the imminence of thelast judgment upon eternal life hereafter; this glowering eye in anemaciated body caused men in the old time world to tremble to thedepths of their being. To look to look away and shudder to feel anewthe fascination of the spectacle to yield to it sate oneself upon ituntil the soul trembled with ardor and fever--that was the last pleasureleft to classical antiquity when its sensibilities had been blunted bythe arena and the gladiatorial show.=To Sum Up All That Has Been Said=: that condition of soul at which thesaint or expectant saint is rejoiced is a combination of elements whichwe are all familiar with except that under other influences than thoseof mere religious ideation they customarily arouse the censure of men inthe same way that when combined with religion itself and regarded as thesupreme attainment of sanctity they are object of admiration and evenof prayer--at least in more simple times. Very soon the saint turns uponhimself that severity that is so closely allied to the instinct ofdomination at any price and which inspire even in the most solitaryindividual the sense of power. Soon his swollen sensitiveness of feelingbreaks forth from the longing to restrain his passions within it and istransformed into a longing to master them as if they were wild steedsthe master impulse being ever that of a proud spirit; next he craves acomplete cessation of all perturbing fascinating feelings a wakingsleep an enduring repose in the lap of a dull animal plant-likeindolence. Next he seeks the battle and extinguishes it within himselfbecause weariness and boredom confront him. He binds hisself-deification with self-contempt. He delights in the wild tumult ofhis desires and the sharp pain of sin in the very idea of being lost.He is able to play his very passions for instance the desire todomineer a trick so that he goes to the other extreme of abjecthumiliation and subjection so that his overwrought soul is without anyrestraint through this antithesis. And finally when indulgence invisions in talks with the dead or with divine beings overcomes himthis is really but a form of gratification that he craves perhaps aform of gratification in which all other gratifications are blended.Novalis one of the authorities in matters of sanctity because of hisexperience and instinct betrays the whole secret with the utmostsimplicity when he says: It is remarkable that the close connection ofgratification religion and cruelty has not long ago made men aware oftheir inner relationship and common tendency.=Not What the Saint is but what he was in= the eyes of thenon-sanctified gives him his historical importance. Because thereexisted a delusion respecting the saint his soul states being falselyviewed and his personality being sundered as much as possible fromhumanity as a something incomparable and supernatural because of thesethings he attained the extraordinary with which he swayed theimaginations of whole nations and whole ages. Even he knew himself notfor even he regarded his dispositions passions and actions inaccordance with a system of interpretation as artificial and exaggeratedas the pneumatic interpretation of the bible. The distorted and diseasedin his own nature with its blending of spiritual poverty defectiveknowledge ruined health overwrought nerves remained as hidden fromhis view as from the view of his beholders. He was neither aparticularly good man nor a particularly bad man but he stood forsomething that was far above the human standard in wisdom and goodness.Faith in him sustained faith in the divine and miraculous in areligious significance of all existence in an impending day ofjudgment. In the last rays of the setting sun of the ancient worldwhich fell upon the christian peoples the shadowy form of the saintattained enormous proportions--to such enormous proportions indeedthat down even to our own age which no longer believes in god thereare thinkers who believe in the saints.It stands to reason that this sketch of the saint made upon the modelof the whole species can be confronted with many opposing sketches thatwould create a more agreeable impression. There are certain exceptionsamong the species who distinguish themselves either by especialgentleness or especial humanity and perhaps by the strength of theirown personality. Others are in the highest degree fascinating becausecertain of their delusions shed a particular glow over their wholebeing as is the case with the founder of christianity who took himselffor the only begotten son of God and hence felt himself sinless; so thatthrough his imagination--that should not be too harshly judged since thewhole of antiquity swarmed with sons of god--he attained the same goalthe sense of complete sinlessness complete irresponsibility that cannow be attained by every individual through science.--In the same mannerI have viewed the saints of India who occupy an intermediate stationbetween the christian saints and the Greek philosophers and hence arenot to be regarded as a pure type. Knowledge and science--as far as theyexisted--and superiority to the rest of mankind by logical disciplineand training of the intellectual powers were insisted upon by theBuddhists as essential to sanctity just as they were denounced by thechristian world as the indications of sinfulness.
