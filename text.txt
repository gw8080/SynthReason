prefacesupposing that truth is a woman--what then is there not groundfor suspecting that all philosophers in so far as they have beendogmatists have failed to understand women--that the terribleseriousness and clumsy importunity with which they have usually paidtheir addresses to truth have been unskilled and unseemly methods forwinning a woman certainly she has never allowed herself to be won; andat present every kind of dogma stands with sad and discouraged mien--ifindeed it stands at all! for there are scoffers who maintain that ithas fallen that all dogma lies on the ground--nay more that it is atits last gasp. but to speak seriously there are good grounds for hopingthat all dogmatizing in philosophy whatever solemn whatever conclusiveand decided airs it has assumed may have been only a noble puerilismand tyronism; and probably the time is at hand when it will be onceand again understood what has actually sufficed for the basis of suchimposing and absolute philosophical edifices as the dogmatists havehitherto reared: perhaps some popular superstition of immemorial timesuch as the soul-superstition which in the form of subject- andego-superstition has not yet ceased doing mischief: perhaps someplay upon words a deception on the part of grammar or anaudacious generalization of very restricted very personal veryhuman--all-too-human facts. the philosophy of the dogmatists it is tobe hoped was only a promise for thousands of years afterwards as wasastrology in still earlier times in the service of which probably morelabour gold acuteness and patience have been spent than on anyactual science hitherto: we owe to it and to its super-terrestrialpretensions in asia and egypt the grand style of architecture. it seemsthat in order to inscribe themselves upon the heart of humanity witheverlasting claims all great things have first to wander about theearth as enormous and awe-inspiring caricatures: dogmatic philosophy hasbeen a caricature of this kind--for instance the vedanta doctrine inasia and platonism in europe. let us not be ungrateful to it althoughit must certainly be confessed that the worst the most tiresomeand the most dangerous of errors hitherto has been a dogmatisterror--namely platos invention of pure spirit and the good in itself.but now when it has been surmounted when europe rid of this nightmarecan again draw breath freely and at least enjoy a healthier--sleepwe whose duty is wakefulness itself are the heirs of all the strengthwhich the struggle against this error has fostered. it amounted tothe very inversion of truth and the denial of the perspective--thefundamental condition--of life to speak of spirit and the good as platospoke of them; indeed one might ask as a physician: how did such amalady attack that finest product of antiquity plato had the wickedsocrates really corrupted him was socrates after all a corrupter ofyouths and deserved his hemlock but the struggle against platoor--to speak plainer and for the people--the struggle againstthe ecclesiastical oppression of millenniums of christianity forchristianity is platonism for the people produced in europea magnificent tension of soul such as had not existed anywherepreviously; with such a tensely strained bow one can now aim at thefurthest goals. as a matter of fact the european feels this tension asa state of distress and twice attempts have been made in grand style tounbend the bow: once by means of jesuitism and the second time by meansof democratic enlightenment--which with the aid of liberty of the pressand newspaper-reading might in fact bring it about that the spiritwould not so easily find itself in distress! the germans inventedgunpowder--all credit to them! but they again made things square--theyinvented printing. but we who are neither jesuits nor democratsnor even sufficiently germans we good europeans and free very freespirits--we have it still all the distress of spirit and all thetension of its bow! and perhaps also the arrow the duty and whoknows the goal to aim at....sils maria upper engadine june .chapter i. prejudices of philosophers. the will to truth which is to tempt us to many a hazardousenterprise the famous truthfulness of which all philosophers havehitherto spoken with respect what questions has this will to truth notlaid before us! what strange perplexing questionable questions! it isalready a long story; yet it seems as if it were hardly commenced. isit any wonder if we at last grow distrustful lose patience and turnimpatiently away that this sphinx teaches us at last to ask questionsourselves who is it really that puts questions to us here what reallyis this will to truth in us in fact we made a long halt at thequestion as to the origin of this will--until at last we came to anabsolute standstill before a yet more fundamental question. we inquiredabout the value of this will. granted that we want the truth: why notrather untruth and uncertainty even ignorance the problem of thevalue of truth presented itself before us--or was it we who presentedourselves before the problem which of us is the oedipus here whichthe sphinx it would seem to be a rendezvous of questions and notes ofinterrogation. and could it be believed that it at last seems to us asif the problem had never been propounded before as if we were the firstto discern it get a sight of it and risk raising it for there is riskin raising it perhaps there is no greater risk.. how could anything originate out of its opposite for example truthout of error or the will to truth out of the will to deception or thegenerous deed out of selfishness or the pure sun-bright vision of thewise man out of covetousness such genesis is impossible; whoever dreamsof it is a fool nay worse than a fool; things of the highestvalue must have a different origin an origin of their own--in thistransitory seductive illusory paltry world in this turmoil ofdelusion and cupidity they cannot have their source. but rather inthe lap of being in the intransitory in the concealed god in thething-in-itself--there must be their source and nowhere else!--thismode of reasoning discloses the typical prejudice by whichmetaphysicians of all times can be recognized this mode of valuationis at the back of all their logical procedure; through this belief oftheirs they exert themselves for their knowledge for something thatis in the end solemnly christened the truth. the fundamental belief ofmetaphysicians is the belief in antitheses of values. it never occurredeven to the wariest of them to doubt here on the very threshold wheredoubt however was most necessary; though they had made a solemnvow de omnibus dubitandum. for it may be doubted firstly whetherantitheses exist at all; and secondly whether the popular valuationsand antitheses of value upon which metaphysicians have set theirseal are not perhaps merely superficial estimates merely provisionalperspectives besides being probably made from some corner perhaps frombelow--frog perspectives as it were to borrow an expression currentamong painters. in spite of all the value which may belong to the truethe positive and the unselfish it might be possible that a higherand more fundamental value for life generally should be assigned topretence to the will to delusion to selfishness and cupidity. itmight even be possible that what constitutes the value of those good andrespected things consists precisely in their being insidiouslyrelated knotted and crocheted to these evil and apparently opposedthings--perhaps even in being essentially identical with them. perhaps!but who wishes to concern himself with such dangerous perhapses!for that investigation one must await the advent of a new order ofphilosophers such as will have other tastes and inclinations thereverse of those hitherto prevalent--philosophers of the dangerousperhaps in every sense of the term. and to speak in all seriousness isee such new philosophers beginning to appear.. having kept a sharp eye on philosophers and having read betweentheir lines long enough i now say to myself that the greater part ofconscious thinking must be counted among the instinctive functions andit is so even in the case of philosophical thinking; one has here tolearn anew as one learned anew about heredity and innateness. aslittle as the act of birth comes into consideration in the whole processand procedure of heredity just as little is being-conscious opposedto the instinctive in any decisive sense; the greater part of theconscious thinking of a philosopher is secretly influenced by hisinstincts and forced into definite channels. and behind all logic andits seeming sovereignty of movement there are valuations or to speakmore plainly physiological demands for the maintenance of a definitemode of life for example that the certain is worth more than theuncertain that illusion is less valuable than truth such valuationsin spite of their regulative importance for us might notwithstanding beonly superficial valuations special kinds of _niaiserie_ such as maybe necessary for the maintenance of beings such as ourselves. supposingin effect that man is not just the measure of things.. the falseness of an opinion is not for us any objection to it: it ishere perhaps that our new language sounds most strangely. thequestion is how far an opinion is life-furthering life-preservingspecies-preserving perhaps species-rearing and we are fundamentallyinclined to maintain that the falsest opinions to which the syntheticjudgments a priori belong are the most indispensable to us thatwithout a recognition of logical fictions without a comparison ofreality with the purely imagined world of the absolute and immutablewithout a constant counterfeiting of the world by means of numbersman could not live--that the renunciation of false opinions would bea renunciation of life a negation of life. to recognise untruth as acondition of life; that is certainly to impugn the traditional ideas ofvalue in a dangerous manner and a philosophy which ventures to do sohas thereby alone placed itself beyond good and evil.. that which causes philosophers to be regarded half-distrustfullyand half-mockingly is not the oft-repeated discovery how innocent theyare--how often and easily they make mistakes and lose their way inshort how childish and childlike they are--but that there is notenough honest dealing with them whereas they all raise a loud andvirtuous outcry when the problem of truthfulness is even hinted at inthe remotest manner. they all pose as though their real opinions hadbeen discovered and attained through the self-evolving of a cold puredivinely indifferent dialectic in contrast to all sorts of mysticswho fairer and foolisher talk of inspiration whereas in fact aprejudiced proposition idea or suggestion which is generallytheir hearts desire abstracted and refined is defended by them witharguments sought out after the event. they are all advocates who do notwish to be regarded as such generally astute defenders also of theirprejudices which they dub truths--and very far from having theconscience which bravely admits this to itself very far from havingthe good taste of the courage which goes so far as to let this beunderstood perhaps to warn friend or foe or in cheerful confidenceand self-ridicule. the spectacle of the tartuffery of old kant equallystiff and decent with which he entices us into the dialecticby-ways that lead more correctly mislead to his categoricalimperative--makes us fastidious ones smile we who find no smallamusement in spying out the subtle tricks of old moralists and ethicalpreachers. or still more so the hocus-pocus in mathematical form bymeans of which spinoza has as it were clad his philosophy in mail andmask--in fact the love of his wisdom to translate the term fairlyand squarely--in order thereby to strike terror at once into the heartof the assailant who should dare to cast a glance on that invinciblemaiden that pallas athene:--how much of personal timidity andvulnerability does this masquerade of a sickly recluse betray!. it has gradually become clear to me what every great philosophy uptill now has consisted of--namely the confession of its originator anda species of involuntary and unconscious auto-biography; and moreoverthat the moral or immoral purpose in every philosophy has constitutedthe true vital germ out of which the entire plant has always grown.indeed to understand how the abstrusest metaphysical assertions of aphilosopher have been arrived at it is always well and wise to firstask oneself: what morality do they or does he aim at accordinglyi do not believe that an impulse to knowledge is the father ofphilosophy; but that another impulse here as elsewhere has only madeuse of knowledge and mistaken knowledge! as an instrument. but whoeverconsiders the fundamental impulses of man with a view to determininghow far they may have here acted as inspiring genii or as demons andcobolds will find that they have all practiced philosophy at one timeor another and that each one of them would have been only too glad tolook upon itself as the ultimate end of existence and the legitimatelord over all the other impulses. for every impulse is imperious and assuch attempts to philosophize. to be sure in the case of scholars inthe case of really scientific men it may be otherwise--better ifyou will; there there may really be such a thing as an impulse toknowledge some kind of small independent clock-work which when wellwound up works away industriously to that end without the rest ofthe scholarly impulses taking any material part therein. the actualinterests of the scholar therefore are generally in quite anotherdirection--in the family perhaps or in money-making or in politics;it is in fact almost indifferent at what point of research his littlemachine is placed and whether the hopeful young worker becomes agood philologist a mushroom specialist or a chemist; he is notcharacterised by becoming this or that. in the philosopher on thecontrary there is absolutely nothing impersonal; and above allhis morality furnishes a decided and decisive testimony as to who heis--that is to say in what order the deepest impulses of his naturestand to each other.. how malicious philosophers can be! i know of nothing more stingingthan the joke epicurus took the liberty of making on plato and theplatonists; he called them dionysiokolakes. in its original senseand on the face of it the word signifies flatterers ofdionysius--consequently tyrants accessories and lick-spittles;besides this however it is as much as to say they are all actorsthere is nothing genuine about them for dionysiokolax was a popularname for an actor. and the latter is really the malignant reproach thatepicurus cast upon plato: he was annoyed by the grandiose manner themise en scene style of which plato and his scholars were masters--ofwhich epicurus was not a master! he the old school-teacher of samoswho sat concealed in his little garden at athens and wrote threehundred books perhaps out of rage and ambitious envy of plato whoknows! greece took a hundred years to find out who the garden-godepicurus really was. did she ever find out. there is a point in every philosophy at which the conviction ofthe philosopher appears on the scene; or to put it in the words of anancient mystery:adventavit asinus pulcher et fortissimus.. you desire to live according to nature oh you noble stoics whatfraud of words! imagine to yourselves a being like nature boundlesslyextravagant boundlessly indifferent without purpose or considerationwithout pity or justice at once fruitful and barren and uncertain:imagine to yourselves indifference as a power--how could you livein accordance with such indifference to live--is not that justendeavouring to be otherwise than this nature is not living valuingpreferring being unjust being limited endeavouring to be differentand granted that your imperative living according to nature meansactually the same as living according to life--how could you dodifferently why should you make a principle out of what you yourselvesare and must be in reality however it is quite otherwise with you:while you pretend to read with rapture the canon of your law in natureyou want something quite the contrary you extraordinary stage-playersand self-deluders! in your pride you wish to dictate your morals andideals to nature to nature herself and to incorporate them therein;you insist that it shall be nature according to the stoa and wouldlike everything to be made after your own image as a vast eternalglorification and generalism of stoicism! with all your love for truthyou have forced yourselves so long so persistently and with suchhypnotic rigidity to see nature falsely that is to say stoicallythat you are no longer able to see it otherwise--and to crown all someunfathomable superciliousness gives you the bedlamite hope thatbecause you are able to tyrannize over yourselves--stoicism isself-tyranny--nature will also allow herself to be tyrannized over: isnot the stoic a part of nature... but this is an old and everlastingstory: what happened in old times with the stoics still happens todayas soon as ever a philosophy begins to believe in itself. it alwayscreates the world in its own image; it cannot do otherwise; philosophyis this tyrannical impulse itself the most spiritual will to power thewill to creation of the world the will to the causa prima.. the eagerness and subtlety i should even say craftiness withwhich the problem of the real and the apparent world is dealt with atpresent throughout europe furnishes food for thought and attention; andhe who hears only a will to truth in the background and nothing elsecannot certainly boast of the sharpest ears. in rare and isolatedcases it may really have happened that such a will to truth--a certainextravagant and adventurous pluck a metaphysicians ambition of theforlorn hope--has participated therein: that which in the end alwaysprefers a handful of certainty to a whole cartload of beautifulpossibilities; there may even be puritanical fanatics of consciencewho prefer to put their last trust in a sure nothing rather than in anuncertain something. but that is nihilism and the sign of a despairingmortally wearied soul notwithstanding the courageous bearing such avirtue may display. it seems however to be otherwise with strongerand livelier thinkers who are still eager for life. in that they sideagainst appearance and speak superciliously of perspective inthat they rank the credibility of their own bodies about as low as thecredibility of the ocular evidence that the earth stands still andthus apparently allowing with complacency their securest possessionto escape for what does one at present believe in more firmly thanin ones body--who knows if they are not really trying to win backsomething which was formerly an even securer possession somethingof the old domain of the faith of former times perhaps the immortalsoul perhaps the old god in short ideas by which they could livebetter that is to say more vigorously and more joyously than bymodern ideas there is distrust of these modern ideas in this modeof looking at things a disbelief in all that has been constructedyesterday and today; there is perhaps some slight admixture of satietyand scorn which can no longer endure the bric-a-brac of ideas of themost varied origin such as so-called positivism at present throws onthe market; a disgust of the more refined taste at the village-fairmotleyness and patchiness of all these reality-philosophasters in whomthere is nothing either new or true except this motleyness. therein itseems to me that we should agree with those skeptical anti-realists andknowledge-microscopists of the present day; their instinct which repelsthem from modern reality is unrefuted... what do their retrogradeby-paths concern us! the main thing about them is not that they wishto go back but that they wish to get away therefrom. a little morestrength swing courage and artistic power and they would be off--andnot back!. it seems to me that there is everywhere an attempt at present todivert attention from the actual influence which kant exercised ongerman philosophy and especially to ignore prudently the value whichhe set upon himself. kant was first and foremost proud of his table ofcategories; with it in his hand he said: this is the most difficultthing that could ever be undertaken on behalf of metaphysics. let usonly understand this could be! he was proud of having discovered anew faculty in man the faculty of synthetic judgment a priori. grantingthat he deceived himself in this matter; the development and rapidflourishing of german philosophy depended nevertheless on his pride andon the eager rivalry of the younger generation to discover if possiblesomething--at all events new faculties--of which to be stillprouder!--but let us reflect for a moment--it is high time to do so.how are synthetic judgments a priori possible kant asks himself--andwhat is really his answer by means of a means faculty--butunfortunately not in five words but so circumstantially imposinglyand with such display of german profundity and verbal flourishes thatone altogether loses sight of the comical niaiserie allemande involvedin such an answer. people were beside themselves with delight over thisnew faculty and the jubilation reached its climax when kant furtherdiscovered a moral faculty in man--for at that time germans were stillmoral not yet dabbling in the politics of hard fact. then camethe honeymoon of german philosophy. all the young theologians of thetubingen institution went immediately into the groves--all seeking forfaculties. and what did they not find--in that innocent rich andstill youthful period of the german spirit to which romanticism themalicious fairy piped and sang when one could not yet distinguishbetween finding and inventing! above all a faculty for thetranscendental; schelling christened it intellectual intuitionand thereby gratified the most earnest longings of the naturallypious-inclined germans. one can do no greater wrong to the whole ofthis exuberant and eccentric movement which was really youthfulnessnotwithstanding that it disguised itself so boldly in hoary and senileconceptions than to take it seriously or even treat it with moralindignation. enough however--the world grew older and the dreamvanished. a time came when people rubbed their foreheads and they stillrub them today. people had been dreaming and first and foremost--oldkant. by means of a means faculty--he had said or at least meant tosay. but is that--an answer an explanation or is it not rather merelya repetition of the question how does opium induce sleep by means ofa means faculty namely the virtus dormitiva replies the doctor inmoliere    quia est in eo virtus dormitiva    cujus est natura sensus assoupire.but such replies belong to the realm of comedy and it is high timeto replace the kantian question how are synthetic judgments a prioripossible by another question why is belief in such judgmentsnecessary--in effect it is high time that we should understandthat such judgments must be believed to be true for the sake of thepreservation of creatures like ourselves; though they still mightnaturally be false judgments! or more plainly spoken and roughly andreadily--synthetic judgments a priori should not be possible at all;we have no right to them; in our mouths they are nothing but falsejudgments. only of course the belief in their truth is necessary asplausible belief and ocular evidence belonging to the perspective viewof life. and finally to call to mind the enormous influence whichgerman philosophy--i hope you understand its right to inverted commasgoosefeet--has exercised throughout the whole of europe there isno doubt that a certain virtus dormitiva had a share in it; thanks togerman philosophy it was a delight to the noble idlers the virtuousthe mystics the artiste the three-fourths christians and thepolitical obscurantists of all nations to find an antidote to the stilloverwhelming sensualism which overflowed from the last century intothis in short--sensus assoupire..... as regards materialistic atomism it is one of the best-refutedtheories that have been advanced and in europe there is now perhapsno one in the learned world so unscholarly as to attach serioussignification to it except for convenient everyday use as anabbreviation of the means of expression--thanks chiefly to the poleboscovich: he and the pole copernicus have hitherto been the greatestand most successful opponents of ocular evidence. for while copernicushas persuaded us to believe contrary to all the senses that the earthdoes not stand fast boscovich has taught us to abjure the belief in thelast thing that stood fast of the earth--the belief in substance inmatter in the earth-residuum and particle-atom: it is the greatesttriumph over the senses that has hitherto been gained on earth. onemust however go still further and also declare war relentless warto the knife against the atomistic requirements which still lead adangerous after-life in places where no one suspects them like the morecelebrated metaphysical requirements: one must also above all givethe finishing stroke to that other and more portentous atomism whichchristianity has taught best and longest the soul-atomism. let it bepermitted to designate by this expression the belief which regards thesoul as something indestructible eternal indivisible as a monadas an atomon: this belief ought to be expelled from science! betweenourselves it is not at all necessary to get rid of the soul therebyand thus renounce one of the oldest and most venerated hypotheses--ashappens frequently to the clumsiness of naturalists who can hardlytouch on the soul without immediately losing it. but the way is openfor new acceptations and refinements of the soul-hypothesis; and suchconceptions as mortal soul and soul of subjective multiplicityand soul as social structure of the instincts and passions wanthenceforth to have legitimate rights in science. in that the newpsychologist is about to put an end to the superstitions which havehitherto flourished with almost tropical luxuriance around the idea ofthe soul he is really as it were thrusting himself into a new desertand a new distrust--it is possible that the older psychologists had amerrier and more comfortable time of it; eventually however he findsthat precisely thereby he is also condemned to invent--and who knowsperhaps to discover the new.. psychologists should bethink themselves before putting down theinstinct of self-preservation as the cardinal instinct of an organicbeing. a living thing seeks above all to discharge its strength--lifeitself is will to power; self-preservation is only one of the indirectand most frequent results thereof. in short here as everywhere elselet us beware of superfluous teleological principles!--one of whichis the instinct of self-preservation we owe it to spinozasinconsistency. it is thus in effect that method ordains which mustbe essentially economy of principles.. it is perhaps just dawning on five or six minds that naturalphilosophy is only a world-exposition and world-arrangement accordingto us if i may say so! and not a world-explanation; but in so far asit is based on belief in the senses it is regarded as more and for along time to come must be regarded as more--namely as an explanation.it has eyes and fingers of its own it has ocular evidence andpalpableness of its own: this operates fascinatingly persuasively andconvincingly upon an age with fundamentally plebeian tastes--in fact itfollows instinctively the canon of truth of eternal popular sensualism.what is clear what is explained only that which can be seen andfelt--one must pursue every problem thus far. obversely however thecharm of the platonic mode of thought which was an aristocratic modeconsisted precisely in resistance to obvious sense-evidence--perhapsamong men who enjoyed even stronger and more fastidious senses than ourcontemporaries but who knew how to find a higher triumph in remainingmasters of them: and this by means of pale cold grey conceptionalnetworks which they threw over the motley whirl of the senses--themob of the senses as plato said. in this overcoming of the world andinterpreting of the world in the manner of plato there was an enjoymentdifferent from that which the physicists of today offer us--and likewisethe darwinists and anti-teleologists among the physiological workerswith their principle of the smallest possible effort and the greatestpossible blunder. where there is nothing more to see or to grasp thereis also nothing more for men to do--that is certainly an imperativedifferent from the platonic one but it may notwithstanding be the rightimperative for a hardy laborious race of machinists and bridge-buildersof the future who have nothing but rough work to perform.. to study physiology with a clear conscience one must insist onthe fact that the sense-organs are not phenomena in the sense of theidealistic philosophy; as such they certainly could not be causes!sensualism therefore at least as regulative hypothesis if not asheuristic principle. what and others say even that the external worldis the work of our organs but then our body as a part of this externalworld would be the work of our organs! but then our organs themselveswould be the work of our organs! it seems to me that this is acomplete reductio ad absurdum if the conception causa sui is somethingfundamentally absurd. consequently the external world is not the workof our organs--. there are still harmless self-observers who believe that there areimmediate certainties; for instance i think or as the superstitionof schopenhauer puts it i will; as though cognition here got holdof its object purely and simply as the thing in itself without anyfalsification taking place either on the part of the subject or theobject. i would repeat it however a hundred times that immediatecertainty as well as absolute knowledge and the thing in itselfinvolve a contradictio in adjecto; we really ought to free ourselvesfrom the misleading significance of words! the people on their part maythink that cognition is knowing all about things but the philosophermust say to himself: when i analyze the process that is expressed inthe sentence i think i find a whole series of daring assertions theargumentative proof of which would be difficult perhaps impossible:for instance that it is _i_ who think that there must necessarily besomething that thinks that thinking is an activity and operation on thepart of a being who is thought of as a cause that there is an egoand finally that it is already determined what is to be designated bythinking--that i know what thinking is. for if i had not already decidedwithin myself what it is by what standard could i determine whetherthat which is just happening is not perhaps willing or feeling inshort the assertion i think assumes that i compare my state at thepresent moment with other states of myself which i know in order todetermine what it is; on account of this retrospective connection withfurther knowledge it has at any rate no immediate certainty forme.--in place of the immediate certainty in which the people maybelieve in the special case the philosopher thus finds a series ofmetaphysical questions presented to him veritable conscience questionsof the intellect to wit: whence did i get the notion of thinkingwhy do i believe in cause and effect what gives me the right to speakof an ego and even of an ego as cause and finally of an egoas cause of thought he who ventures to answer these metaphysicalquestions at once by an appeal to a sort of intuitive perception likethe person who says i think and know that this at least istrue actual and certain--will encounter a smile and two notes ofinterrogation in a philosopher nowadays. sir the philosopher willperhaps give him to understand it is improbable that you are notmistaken but why should it be the truth. with regard to the superstitions of logicians i shall never tireof emphasizing a small terse fact which is unwillingly recognized bythese credulous minds--namely that a thought comes when it wishesand not when i wish; so that it is a perversion of the facts of thecase to say that the subject i is the condition of the predicatethink. one thinks; but that this one is precisely the famous oldego is to put it mildly only a supposition an assertion andassuredly not an immediate certainty. after all one has even gone toofar with this one thinks--even the one contains an interpretation ofthe process and does not belong to the process itself. one infers hereaccording to the usual grammatical formula--to think is an activity;every activity requires an agency that is active; consequently... itwas pretty much on the same lines that the older atomism sought besidesthe operating power the material particle wherein it resides and outof which it operates--the atom. more rigorous minds however learnt atlast to get along without this earth-residuum and perhaps some day weshall accustom ourselves even from the logicians point of view toget along without the little one to which the worthy old ego hasrefined itself.. it is certainly not the least charm of a theory that it isrefutable; it is precisely thereby that it attracts the more subtleminds. it seems that the hundred-times-refuted theory of the free willowes its persistence to this charm alone; some one is always appearingwho feels himself strong enough to refute it.. philosophers are accustomed to speak of the will as though it werethe best-known thing in the world; indeed schopenhauer has given usto understand that the will alone is really known to us absolutely andcompletely known without deduction or addition. but it again andagain seems to me that in this case schopenhauer also only did whatphilosophers are in the habit of doing--he seems to have adopted apopular prejudice and exaggerated it. willing seems to me to be aboveall something complicated something that is a unity only in name--andit is precisely in a name that popular prejudice lurks which has gotthe mastery over the inadequate precautions of philosophers in all ages.so let us for once be more cautious let us be unphilosophical: letus say that in all willing there is firstly a plurality of sensationsnamely the sensation of the condition away from which we go thesensation of the condition towards which we go the sensation of thisfrom and towards itself and then besides an accompanying muscularsensation which even without our putting in motion arms and legscommences its action by force of habit directly we will anything.therefore just as sensations and indeed many kinds of sensations areto be recognized as ingredients of the will so in the second placethinking is also to be recognized; in every act of the will there isa ruling thought;--and let us not imagine it possible to sever thisthought from the willing as if the will would then remain over!in the third place the will is not only a complex of sensation andthinking but it is above all an emotion and in fact the emotion of thecommand. that which is termed freedom of the will is essentially theemotion of supremacy in respect to him who must obey: i am free hemust obey--this consciousness is inherent in every will; and equallyso the straining of the attention the straight look which fixes itselfexclusively on one thing the unconditional judgment that this andnothing else is necessary now the inward certainty that obediencewill be rendered--and whatever else pertains to the position of thecommander. a man who wills commands something within himself whichrenders obedience or which he believes renders obedience. but now letus notice what is the strangest thing about the will--this affair soextremely complex for which the people have only one name. inasmuch asin the given circumstances we are at the same time the commanding andthe obeying parties and as the obeying party we know the sensations ofconstraint impulsion pressure resistance and motion which usuallycommence immediately after the act of will; inasmuch as on the otherhand we are accustomed to disregard this duality and to deceiveourselves about it by means of the synthetic term i: a whole seriesof erroneous conclusions and consequently of false judgments about thewill itself has become attached to the act of willing--to such a degreethat he who wills believes firmly that willing suffices for action.since in the majority of cases there has only been exercise of willwhen the effect of the command--consequently obedience and thereforeaction--was to be expected the appearance has translated itself intothe sentiment as if there were a necessity of effect; in a word he whowills believes with a fair amount of certainty that will and action aresomehow one; he ascribes the success the carrying out of the willingto the will itself and thereby enjoys an increase of the sensationof power which accompanies all success. freedom of will--that is theexpression for the complex state of delight of the person exercisingvolition who commands and at the same time identifies himself withthe executor of the order--who as such enjoys also the triumph overobstacles but thinks within himself that it was really his own willthat overcame them. in this way the person exercising volition adds thefeelings of delight of his successful executive instruments the usefulunderwills or under-souls--indeed our body is but a social structurecomposed of many souls--to his feelings of delight as commander. leffetcest moi. what happens here is what happens in every well-constructedand happy commonwealth namely that the governing class identifiesitself with the successes of the commonwealth. in all willing it isabsolutely a question of commanding and obeying on the basis asalready said of a social structure composed of many souls on whichaccount a philosopher should claim the right to include willing-as-suchwithin the sphere of morals--regarded as the doctrine of the relationsof supremacy under which the phenomenon of life manifests itself.. that the separate philosophical ideas are not anything optional orautonomously evolving but grow up in connection and relationship witheach other that however suddenly and arbitrarily they seem to appearin the history of thought they nevertheless belong just as much toa system as the collective members of the fauna of a continent--isbetrayed in the end by the circumstance: how unfailingly the mostdiverse philosophers always fill in again a definite fundamental schemeof possible philosophies. under an invisible spell they always revolveonce more in the same orbit however independent of each other theymay feel themselves with their critical or systematic wills somethingwithin them leads them something impels them in definite order theone after the other--to wit the innate methodology and relationshipof their ideas. their thinking is in fact far less a discovery than are-recognizing a remembering a return and a home-coming to a far-offancient common-household of the soul out of which those ideas formerlygrew: philosophizing is so far a kind of atavism of the highest order.the wonderful family resemblance of all indian greek and germanphilosophizing is easily enough explained. in fact where there isaffinity of language owing to the common philosophy of grammar--i meanowing to the unconscious domination and guidance of similar grammaticalfunctions--it cannot but be that everything is prepared at the outsetfor a similar development and succession of philosophical systemsjust as the way seems barred against certain other possibilities ofworld-interpretation. it is highly probable that philosophers within thedomain of the ural-altaic languages where the conception of the subjectis least developed look otherwise into the world and will befound on paths of thought different from those of the indo-germans andmussulmans the spell of certain grammatical functions is ultimatelyalso the spell of physiological valuations and racial conditions.--somuch by way of rejecting lockes superficiality with regard to theorigin of ideas.. the causa sui is the best self-contradiction that has yet beenconceived it is a sort of logical violation and unnaturalness; but theextravagant pride of man has managed to entangle itself profoundly andfrightfully with this very folly. the desire for freedom of willin the superlative metaphysical sense such as still holds swayunfortunately in the minds of the half-educated the desire to bearthe entire and ultimate responsibility for ones actions oneself andto absolve god the world ancestors chance and society therefrominvolves nothing less than to be precisely this causa sui and withmore than munchausen daring to pull oneself up into existence by thehair out of the slough of nothingness. if any one should find out inthis manner the crass stupidity of the celebrated conception of freewill and put it out of his head altogether i beg of him to carryhis enlightenment a step further and also put out of his head thecontrary of this monstrous conception of free will: i mean non-freewill which is tantamount to a misuse of cause and effect. oneshould not wrongly materialise cause and effect as the naturalphilosophers do and whoever like them naturalize in thinking atpresent according to the prevailing mechanical doltishness which makesthe cause press and push until it effects its end; one should usecause and effect only as pure conceptions that is to say asconventional fictions for the purpose of designation and mutualunderstanding--not for explanation. in being-in-itself there isnothing of casual-connection of necessity or of psychologicalnon-freedom; there the effect does not follow the cause there lawdoes not obtain. it is we alone who have devised cause sequencereciprocity relativity constraint number law freedom motiveand purpose; and when we interpret and intermix this symbol-worldas being-in-itself with things we act once more as we have alwaysacted--mythologically. the non-free will is mythology; in real lifeit is only a question of strong and weak wills.--it is almost alwaysa symptom of what is lacking in himself when a thinker in everycausal-connection and psychological necessity manifests somethingof compulsion indigence obsequiousness oppression and non-freedom;it is suspicious to have such feelings--the person betrays himself. andin general if i have observed correctly the non-freedom of the willis regarded as a problem from two entirely opposite standpoints butalways in a profoundly personal manner: some will not give up theirresponsibility their belief in themselves the personal right totheir merits at any price the vain races belong to this class; otherson the contrary do not wish to be answerable for anything or blamedfor anything and owing to an inward self-contempt seek to get out ofthe business no matter how. the latter when they write books arein the habit at present of taking the side of criminals; a sort ofsocialistic sympathy is their favourite disguise. and as a matter offact the fatalism of the weak-willed embellishes itself surprisinglywhen it can pose as la religion de la souffrance humaine; that is itsgood taste.. let me be pardoned as an old philologist who cannot desist fromthe mischief of putting his finger on bad modes of interpretation butnatures conformity to law of which you physicists talk so proudlyas though--why it exists only owing to your interpretation and badphilology. it is no matter of fact no text but rather just anaively humanitarian adjustment and perversion of meaning with whichyou make abundant concessions to the democratic instincts of the modernsoul! everywhere equality before the law--nature is not different inthat respect nor better than we: a fine instance of secret motivein which the vulgar antagonism to everything privileged andautocratic--likewise a second and more refined atheism--is once moredisguised. ni dieu ni maitre--that also is what you want; andtherefore cheers for natural law!--is it not so but as has beensaid that is interpretation not text; and somebody might come alongwho with opposite intentions and modes of interpretation could readout of the same nature and with regard to the same phenomena justthe tyrannically inconsiderate and relentless enforcement of the claimsof power--an interpreter who should so place the unexceptionalness andunconditionalness of all will to power before your eyes that almostevery word and the word tyranny itself would eventually seemunsuitable or like a weakening and softening metaphor--as being toohuman; and who should nevertheless end by asserting the same aboutthis world as you do namely that it has a necessary and calculablecourse not however because laws obtain in it but because they areabsolutely lacking and every power effects its ultimate consequencesevery moment. granted that this also is only interpretation--and youwill be eager enough to make this objection--well so much the better.. all psychology hitherto has run aground on moral prejudices andtimidities it has not dared to launch out into the depths. in so faras it is allowable to recognize in that which has hitherto been writtenevidence of that which has hitherto been kept silent it seems as ifnobody had yet harboured the notion of psychology as the morphologyand development-doctrine of the will to power as i conceive of it.the power of moral prejudices has penetrated deeply into the mostintellectual world the world apparently most indifferent andunprejudiced and has obviously operated in an injurious obstructiveblinding and distorting manner. a proper physio-psychology has tocontend with unconscious antagonism in the heart of the investigatorit has the heart against it even a doctrine of the reciprocalconditionalness of the good and the bad impulses causes asrefined immorality distress and aversion in a still strong and manlyconscience--still more so a doctrine of the derivation of all goodimpulses from bad ones. if however a person should regard eventhe emotions of hatred envy covetousness and imperiousnessas life-conditioning emotions as factors which must be presentfundamentally and essentially in the general economy of life whichmust therefore be further developed if life is to be furtherdeveloped he will suffer from such a view of things as fromsea-sickness. and yet this hypothesis is far from being the strangestand most painful in this immense and almost new domain of dangerousknowledge and there are in fact a hundred good reasons why every oneshould keep away from it who can do so! on the other hand if one hasonce drifted hither with ones bark well! very good! now let us set ourteeth firmly! let us open our eyes and keep our hand fast on the helm!we sail away right over morality we crush out we destroy perhaps theremains of our own morality by daring to make our voyage thither--butwhat do we matter. never yet did a profounder world of insight revealitself to daring travelers and adventurers and the psychologist whothus makes a sacrifice--it is not the sacrifizio dell intellettoon the contrary!--will at least be entitled to demand in return thatpsychology shall once more be recognized as the queen of the sciencesfor whose service and equipment the other sciences exist. for psychologyis once more the path to the fundamental problems.chapter ii. the free spirit. o sancta simplicitiatas! in what strange simplification andfalsification man lives! one can never cease wondering when once one hasgot eyes for beholding this marvel! how we have made everything aroundus clear and free and easy and simple! how we have been able to giveour senses a passport to everything superficial our thoughts a godlikedesire for wanton pranks and wrong inferences!--how from the beginningwe have contrived to retain our ignorance in order to enjoy an almostinconceivable freedom thoughtlessness imprudence heartinessand gaiety--in order to enjoy life! and only on this solidifiedgranite-like foundation of ignorance could knowledge rear itselfhitherto the will to knowledge on the foundation of a far more powerfulwill the will to ignorance to the uncertain to the untrue! not asits opposite but--as its refinement! it is to be hoped indeed thatlanguage here as elsewhere will not get over its awkwardness and thatit will continue to talk of opposites where there are only degreesand many refinements of gradation; it is equally to be hoped that theincarnated tartuffery of morals which now belongs to our unconquerableflesh and blood will turn the words round in the mouths of usdiscerning ones. here and there we understand it and laugh at the wayin which precisely the best knowledge seeks most to retain us in thissimplified thoroughly artificial suitably imagined and suitablyfalsified world: at the way in which whether it will or not it loveserror because as living itself it loves life!. after such a cheerful commencement a serious word would fain beheard; it appeals to the most serious minds. take care ye philosophersand friends of knowledge and beware of martyrdom! of suffering for thetruths sake! even in your own defense! it spoils all the innocenceand fine neutrality of your conscience; it makes you headstrong againstobjections and red rags; it stupefies animalizes and brutalizes whenin the struggle with danger slander suspicion expulsion and evenworse consequences of enmity ye have at last to play your last cardas protectors of truth upon earth--as though the truth were such aninnocent and incompetent creature as to require protectors! and you ofall people ye knights of the sorrowful countenance messrs loafers andcobweb-spinners of the spirit! finally ye know sufficiently well thatit cannot be of any consequence if ye just carry your point; ye knowthat hitherto no philosopher has carried his point and that there mightbe a more laudable truthfulness in every little interrogative markwhich you place after your special words and favourite doctrines andoccasionally after yourselves than in all the solemn pantomime andtrumping games before accusers and law-courts! rather go out of the way!flee into concealment! and have your masks and your ruses that ye maybe mistaken for what you are or somewhat feared! and pray dont forgetthe garden the garden with golden trellis-work! and have people aroundyou who are as a garden--or as music on the waters at eventide whenalready the day becomes a memory. choose the good solitude the freewanton lightsome solitude which also gives you the right still toremain good in any sense whatsoever! how poisonous how crafty how baddoes every long war make one which cannot be waged openly by meansof force! how personal does a long fear make one a long watchingof enemies of possible enemies! these pariahs of society theselong-pursued badly-persecuted ones--also the compulsory recluses thespinozas or giordano brunos--always become in the end even under themost intellectual masquerade and perhaps without being themselves awareof it refined vengeance-seekers and poison-brewers just lay barethe foundation of spinozas ethics and theology! not to speak ofthe stupidity of moral indignation which is the unfailing sign in aphilosopher that the sense of philosophical humour has left him. themartyrdom of the philosopher his sacrifice for the sake of truthforces into the light whatever of the agitator and actor lurks in him;and if one has hitherto contemplated him only with artistic curiositywith regard to many a philosopher it is easy to understand the dangerousdesire to see him also in his deterioration deteriorated into amartyr into a stage-and-tribune-bawler. only that it is necessarywith such a desire to be clear what spectacle one will see in anycase--merely a satyric play merely an epilogue farce merely thecontinued proof that the long real tragedy is at an end supposing thatevery philosophy has been a long tragedy in its origin.. every select man strives instinctively for a citadel and a privacywhere he is free from the crowd the many the majority--where he mayforget men who are the rule as their exception;--exclusive only ofthe case in which he is pushed straight to such men by a still strongerinstinct as a discerner in the great and exceptional sense. whoever inintercourse with men does not occasionally glisten in all the greenand grey colours of distress owing to disgust satiety sympathygloominess and solitariness is assuredly not a man of elevated tastes;supposing however that he does not voluntarily take all this burdenand disgust upon himself that he persistently avoids it and remainsas i said quietly and proudly hidden in his citadel one thing is thencertain: he was not made he was not predestined for knowledge. for assuch he would one day have to say to himself: the devil take my goodtaste! but the rule is more interesting than the exception--thanmyself the exception! and he would go down and above all he wouldgo inside. the long and serious study of the average man--andconsequently much disguise self-overcoming familiarity and badintercourse all intercourse is bad intercourse except with onesequals:--that constitutes a necessary part of the life-history of everyphilosopher; perhaps the most disagreeable odious and disappointingpart. if he is fortunate however as a favourite child of knowledgeshould be he will meet with suitable auxiliaries who will shorten andlighten his task; i mean so-called cynics those who simply recognizethe animal the commonplace and the rule in themselves and at thesame time have so much spirituality and ticklishness as to make themtalk of themselves and their like before witnesses--sometimes theywallow even in books as on their own dung-hill. cynicism is the onlyform in which base souls approach what is called honesty; and thehigher man must open his ears to all the coarser or finer cynicism andcongratulate himself when the clown becomes shameless right beforehim or the scientific satyr speaks out. there are even cases whereenchantment mixes with the disgust--namely where by a freak of naturegenius is bound to some such indiscreet billy-goat and ape as in thecase of the abbe galiani the profoundest acutest and perhaps alsofilthiest man of his century--he was far profounder than voltaire andconsequently also a good deal more silent. it happens more frequentlyas has been hinted that a scientific head is placed on an apes body afine exceptional understanding in a base soul an occurrence by no meansrare especially among doctors and moral physiologists. and wheneveranyone speaks without bitterness or rather quite innocently of manas a belly with two requirements and a head with one; whenever any onesees seeks and wants to see only hunger sexual instinct and vanityas the real and only motives of human actions; in short when any onespeaks badly--and not even ill--of man then ought the lover ofknowledge to hearken attentively and diligently; he ought in generalto have an open ear wherever there is talk without indignation. for theindignant man and he who perpetually tears and lacerates himself withhis own teeth or in place of himself the world god or societymay indeed morally speaking stand higher than the laughing andself-satisfied satyr but in every other sense he is the more ordinarymore indifferent and less instructive case. and no one is such a liaras the indignant man.. it is difficult to be understood especially when one thinks andlives gangasrotogati footnote: like the river ganges: presto. amongthose only who think and live otherwise--namely kurmagati footnote:like the tortoise: lento. or at best froglike mandeikagatifootnote: like the frog: staccato. i do everything to be difficultlyunderstood myself!--and one should be heartily grateful for thegood will to some refinement of interpretation. as regards the goodfriends however who are always too easy-going and think that asfriends they have a right to ease one does well at the very first togrant them a play-ground and romping-place for misunderstanding--one canthus laugh still; or get rid of them altogether these good friends--andlaugh then also!. what is most difficult to render from one language into anotheris the tempo of its style which has its basis in the character of therace or to speak more physiologically in the average tempo of theassimilation of its nutriment. there are honestly meant translationswhich as involuntary vulgarizations are almost falsifications of theoriginal merely because its lively and merry tempo which overleaps andobviates all dangers in word and expression could not also berendered. a german is almost incapacitated for presto in his language;consequently also as may be reasonably inferred for many of the mostdelightful and daring nuances of free free-spirited thought. and justas the buffoon and satyr are foreign to him in body and conscienceso aristophanes and petronius are untranslatable for him. everythingponderous viscous and pompously clumsy all long-winded and wearyingspecies of style are developed in profuse variety among germans--pardonme for stating the fact that even goethes prose in its mixture ofstiffness and elegance is no exception as a reflection of the goodold time to which it belongs and as an expression of german taste at atime when there was still a german taste which was a rococo-tastein moribus et artibus. lessing is an exception owing to his histrionicnature which understood much and was versed in many things; he who wasnot the translator of bayle to no purpose who took refuge willingly inthe shadow of diderot and voltaire and still more willingly among theroman comedy-writers--lessing loved also free-spiritism in the tempoand flight out of germany. but how could the german language evenin the prose of lessing imitate the tempo of machiavelli who in hisprincipe makes us breathe the dry fine air of florence and cannothelp presenting the most serious events in a boisterous allegrissimoperhaps not without a malicious artistic sense of the contrast heventures to present--long heavy difficult dangerous thoughts anda tempo of the gallop and of the best wantonest humour finally whowould venture on a german translation of petronius who more than anygreat musician hitherto was a master of presto in invention ideas andwords what matter in the end about the swamps of the sick evil worldor of the ancient world when like him one has the feet of a windthe rush the breath the emancipating scorn of a wind which makeseverything healthy by making everything run! and with regard toaristophanes--that transfiguring complementary genius for whosesake one pardons all hellenism for having existed provided one hasunderstood in its full profundity all that there requires pardon andtransfiguration; there is nothing that has caused me to meditate more onplatos secrecy and sphinx-like nature than the happily preserved petitfait that under the pillow of his death-bed there was found nobible nor anything egyptian pythagorean or platonic--but a book ofaristophanes. how could even plato have endured life--a greek life whichhe repudiated--without an aristophanes!. it is the business of the very few to be independent; it is aprivilege of the strong. and whoever attempts it even with the bestright but without being obliged to do so proves that he is probablynot only strong but also daring beyond measure. he enters into alabyrinth he multiplies a thousandfold the dangers which life in itselfalready brings with it; not the least of which is that no one can seehow and where he loses his way becomes isolated and is torn piecemealby some minotaur of conscience. supposing such a one comes to grief itis so far from the comprehension of men that they neither feel it norsympathize with it. and he cannot any longer go back! he cannot even goback again to the sympathy of men!. our deepest insights must--and should--appear as follies and undercertain circumstances as crimes when they come unauthorizedly tothe ears of those who are not disposed and predestined for them. theexoteric and the esoteric as they were formerly distinguished byphilosophers--among the indians as among the greeks persians andmussulmans in short wherever people believed in gradations of rank andnot in equality and equal rights--are not so much in contradistinctionto one another in respect to the exoteric class standing without andviewing estimating measuring and judging from the outside and notfrom the inside; the more essential distinction is that the class inquestion views things from below upwards--while the esoteric class viewsthings from above downwards. there are heights of the soul from whichtragedy itself no longer appears to operate tragically; and if all thewoe in the world were taken together who would dare to decide whetherthe sight of it would necessarily seduce and constrain to sympathy andthus to a doubling of the woe... that which serves the higher class ofmen for nourishment or refreshment must be almost poison to an entirelydifferent and lower order of human beings. the virtues of the commonman would perhaps mean vice and weakness in a philosopher; it might bepossible for a highly developed man supposing him to degenerate and goto ruin to acquire qualities thereby alone for the sake of which hewould have to be honoured as a saint in the lower world into which hehad sunk. there are books which have an inverse value for the soul andthe health according as the inferior soul and the lower vitality or thehigher and more powerful make use of them. in the former case they aredangerous disturbing unsettling books in the latter case they areherald-calls which summon the bravest to their bravery. books for thegeneral reader are always ill-smelling books the odour of paltry peopleclings to them. where the populace eat and drink and even where theyreverence it is accustomed to stink. one should not go into churches ifone wishes to breathe pure air.. in our youthful years we still venerate and despise without the artof nuance which is the best gain of life and we have rightly to dohard penance for having fallen upon men and things with yea and nay.everything is so arranged that the worst of all tastes the taste forthe unconditional is cruelly befooled and abused until a man learnsto introduce a little art into his sentiments and prefers to tryconclusions with the artificial as do the real artists of life. theangry and reverent spirit peculiar to youth appears to allow itself nopeace until it has suitably falsified men and things to be ableto vent its passion upon them: youth in itself even is somethingfalsifying and deceptive. later on when the young soul tortured bycontinual disillusions finally turns suspiciously against itself--stillardent and savage even in its suspicion and remorse of conscience: howit upbraids itself how impatiently it tears itself how it revengesitself for its long self-blinding as though it had been a voluntaryblindness! in this transition one punishes oneself by distrust of onessentiments; one tortures ones enthusiasm with doubt one feels even thegood conscience to be a danger as if it were the self-concealment andlassitude of a more refined uprightness; and above all one espousesupon principle the cause against youth.--a decade later and onecomprehends that all this was also still--youth!. throughout the longest period of human history--one calls it theprehistoric period--the value or non-value of an action was inferredfrom its consequences; the action in itself was not taken intoconsideration any more than its origin; but pretty much as in china atpresent where the distinction or disgrace of a child redounds toits parents the retro-operating power of success or failure was whatinduced men to think well or ill of an action. let us call this periodthe pre-moral period of mankind; the imperative know thyself! wasthen still unknown.--in the last ten thousand years on the other handon certain large portions of the earth one has gradually got so farthat one no longer lets the consequences of an action but its origindecide with regard to its worth: a great achievement as a whole animportant refinement of vision and of criterion the unconscious effectof the supremacy of aristocratic values and of the belief in originthe mark of a period which may be designated in the narrower sense asthe moral one: the first attempt at self-knowledge is therebymade. instead of the consequences the origin--what an inversionof perspective! and assuredly an inversion effected only after longstruggle and wavering! to be sure an ominous new superstition apeculiar narrowness of interpretation attained supremacy preciselythereby: the origin of an action was interpreted in the most definitesense possible as origin out of an intention; people were agreed in thebelief that the value of an action lay in the value of its intention.the intention as the sole origin and antecedent history of an action:under the influence of this prejudice moral praise and blame have beenbestowed and men have judged and even philosophized almost up to thepresent day.--is it not possible however that the necessity may nowhave arisen of again making up our minds with regard to the reversingand fundamental shifting of values owing to a new self-consciousnessand acuteness in man--is it not possible that we may be standing onthe threshold of a period which to begin with would be distinguishednegatively as ultra-moral: nowadays when at least among us immoraliststhe suspicion arises that the decisive value of an action lies preciselyin that which is not intentional and that all its intentionalness allthat is seen sensible or sensed in it belongs to its surface orskin--which like every skin betrays something but conceals stillmore in short we believe that the intention is only a sign or symptomwhich first requires an explanation--a sign moreover which has toomany interpretations and consequently hardly any meaning in itselfalone: that morality in the sense in which it has been understoodhitherto as intention-morality has been a prejudice perhaps aprematureness or preliminariness probably something of the same rankas astrology and alchemy but in any case something which must besurmounted. the surmounting of morality in a certain sense even theself-mounting of morality--let that be the name for the long-secretlabour which has been reserved for the most refined the most uprightand also the most wicked consciences of today as the living touchstonesof the soul.. it cannot be helped: the sentiment of surrender of sacrifice forones neighbour and all self-renunciation-morality must be mercilesslycalled to account and brought to judgment; just as the aestheticsof disinterested contemplation under which the emasculation of artnowadays seeks insidiously enough to create itself a good conscience.there is far too much witchery and sugar in the sentiments for othersand not for myself for one not needing to be doubly distrustful hereand for one asking promptly: are they not perhaps--deceptions--thatthey please--him who has them and him who enjoys their fruit and alsothe mere spectator--that is still no argument in their favour but justcalls for caution. let us therefore be cautious!. at whatever standpoint of philosophy one may place oneself nowadaysseen from every position the erroneousness of the world in which wethink we live is the surest and most certain thing our eyes can lightupon: we find proof after proof thereof which would fain allure us intosurmises concerning a deceptive principle in the nature of things.he however who makes thinking itself and consequently the spiritresponsible for the falseness of the world--an honourable exit whichevery conscious or unconscious advocatus dei avails himself of--hewho regards this world including space time form and movement asfalsely deduced would have at least good reason in the end to becomedistrustful also of all thinking; has it not hitherto been playing uponus the worst of scurvy tricks and what guarantee would it give thatit would not continue to do what it has always been doing in allseriousness the innocence of thinkers has something touching andrespect-inspiring in it which even nowadays permits them to wait uponconsciousness with the request that it will give them honest answers:for example whether it be real or not and why it keeps the outerworld so resolutely at a distance and other questions of the samedescription. the belief in immediate certainties is a moral naivetewhich does honour to us philosophers; but--we have now to cease beingmerely moral men! apart from morality such belief is a folly whichdoes little honour to us! if in middle-class life an ever-ready distrustis regarded as the sign of a bad character and consequently as animprudence here among us beyond the middle-class world and its yeasand nays what should prevent our being imprudent and saying: thephilosopher has at length a right to bad character as the being whohas hitherto been most befooled on earth--he is now under obligationto distrustfulness to the wickedest squinting out of every abyss ofsuspicion.--forgive me the joke of this gloomy grimace and turn ofexpression; for i myself have long ago learned to think and estimatedifferently with regard to deceiving and being deceived and i keep atleast a couple of pokes in the ribs ready for the blind rage with whichphilosophers struggle against being deceived. why not it is nothingmore than a moral prejudice that truth is worth more than semblance; itis in fact the worst proved supposition in the world. so much must beconceded: there could have been no life at all except upon the basisof perspective estimates and semblances; and if with the virtuousenthusiasm and stupidity of many philosophers one wished to do awayaltogether with the seeming world--well granted that you could dothat--at least nothing of your truth would thereby remain! indeedwhat is it that forces us in general to the supposition that there is anessential opposition of true and false is it not enough to supposedegrees of seemingness and as it were lighter and darker shades andtones of semblance--different valeurs as the painters say why mightnot the world which concerns us--be a fiction and to any one whosuggested: but to a fiction belongs an originator--might it not bebluntly replied: why may not this belong also belong to the fictionis it not at length permitted to be a little ironical towards thesubject just as towards the predicate and object might not thephilosopher elevate himself above faith in grammar all respectto governesses but is it not time that philosophy should renouncegoverness-faith. o voltaire! o humanity! o idiocy! there is something ticklish inthe truth and in the search for the truth; and if man goes about ittoo humanely--il ne cherche le vrai que pour faire le bien--i wager hefinds nothing!. supposing that nothing else is given as real but our world ofdesires and passions that we cannot sink or rise to any other realitybut just that of our impulses--for thinking is only a relation of theseimpulses to one another:--are we not permitted to make the attempt andto ask the question whether this which is given does not suffice bymeans of our counterparts for the understanding even of the so-calledmechanical or material world i do not mean as an illusion asemblance a representation in the berkeleyan and schopenhaueriansense but as possessing the same degree of reality as our emotionsthemselves--as a more primitive form of the world of emotions inwhich everything still lies locked in a mighty unity which afterwardsbranches off and develops itself in organic processes naturally alsorefines and debilitates--as a kind of instinctive life in which allorganic functions including self-regulation assimilation nutritionsecretion and change of matter are still synthetically united withone another--as a primary form of life--in the end it is not onlypermitted to make this attempt it is commanded by the conscience oflogical method. not to assume several kinds of causality so long asthe attempt to get along with a single one has not been pushed to itsfurthest extent to absurdity if i may be allowed to say so: that isa morality of method which one may not repudiate nowadays--it followsfrom its definition as mathematicians say. the question is ultimatelywhether we really recognize the will as operating whether we believe inthe causality of the will; if we do so--and fundamentally our belief inthis is just our belief in causality itself--we must make the attemptto posit hypothetically the causality of the will as the only causality.will can naturally only operate on will--and not on matter noton nerves for instance: in short the hypothesis must behazarded whether will does not operate on will wherever effectsare recognized--and whether all mechanical action inasmuch as a poweroperates therein is not just the power of will the effect of will.granted finally that we succeeded in explaining our entire instinctivelife as the development and ramification of one fundamental form ofwill--namely the will to power as my thesis puts it; granted that allorganic functions could be traced back to this will to power and thatthe solution of the problem of generation and nutrition--it is oneproblem--could also be found therein: one would thus have acquired theright to define all active force unequivocally as will to power. theworld seen from within the world defined and designated according toits intelligible character--it would simply be will to power andnothing else.. what does not that mean in popular language: god is disproved butnot the devil--on the contrary! on the contrary my friends! and whothe devil also compels you to speak popularly!. as happened finally in all the enlightenment of modern times withthe french revolution that terrible farce quite superfluous whenjudged close at hand into which however the noble and visionaryspectators of all europe have interpreted from a distance their ownindignation and enthusiasm so long and passionately until the text hasdisappeared under the interpretation so a noble posterity might oncemore misunderstand the whole of the past and perhaps only thereby makeits aspect endurable.--or rather has not this already happened havenot we ourselves been--that noble posterity and in so far as we nowcomprehend this is it not--thereby already past. nobody will very readily regard a doctrine as true merely becauseit makes people happy or virtuous--excepting perhaps the amiableidealists who are enthusiastic about the good true and beautifuland let all kinds of motley coarse and good-natured desirabilitiesswim about promiscuously in their pond. happiness and virtue are noarguments. it is willingly forgotten however even on the part ofthoughtful minds that to make unhappy and to make bad are just aslittle counter-arguments. a thing could be true although it were inthe highest degree injurious and dangerous; indeed the fundamentalconstitution of existence might be such that one succumbed by a fullknowledge of it--so that the strength of a mind might be measured bythe amount of truth it could endure--or to speak more plainly by theextent to which it required truth attenuated veiled sweetened dampedand falsified. but there is no doubt that for the discovery of certainportions of truth the wicked and unfortunate are more favourablysituated and have a greater likelihood of success; not to speak of thewicked who are happy--a species about whom moralists are silent. perhapsseverity and craft are more favourable conditions for the development ofstrong independent spirits and philosophers than the gentle refinedyielding good-nature and habit of taking things easily which areprized and rightly prized in a learned man. presupposing alwaysto begin with that the term philosopher be not confined to thephilosopher who writes books or even introduces his philosophy intobooks!--stendhal furnishes a last feature of the portrait of thefree-spirited philosopher which for the sake of german taste i willnot omit to underline--for it is opposed to german taste. pour etrebon philosophe says this last great psychologist il faut etre secclair sans illusion. un banquier qui a fait fortune a une partie ducaractere requis pour faire des decouvertes en philosophie cest-a-direpour voir clair dans ce qui est.. everything that is profound loves the mask: the profoundest thingshave a hatred even of figure and likeness. should not the contrary onlybe the right disguise for the shame of a god to go about in a questionworth asking!--it would be strange if some mystic has not alreadyventured on the same kind of thing. there are proceedings of such adelicate nature that it is well to overwhelm them with coarsenessand make them unrecognizable; there are actions of love and of anextravagant magnanimity after which nothing can be wiser than to takea stick and thrash the witness soundly: one thereby obscures hisrecollection. many a one is able to obscure and abuse his own memory inorder at least to have vengeance on this sole party in the secret:shame is inventive. they are not the worst things of which one ismost ashamed: there is not only deceit behind a mask--there is so muchgoodness in craft. i could imagine that a man with something costly andfragile to conceal would roll through life clumsily and rotundly likean old green heavily-hooped wine-cask: the refinement of his shamerequiring it to be so. a man who has depths in his shame meets hisdestiny and his delicate decisions upon paths which few ever reachand with regard to the existence of which his nearest and most intimatefriends may be ignorant; his mortal danger conceals itself from theireyes and equally so his regained security. such a hidden naturewhich instinctively employs speech for silence and concealment and isinexhaustible in evasion of communication desires and insists that amask of himself shall occupy his place in the hearts and heads of hisfriends; and supposing he does not desire it his eyes will some day beopened to the fact that there is nevertheless a mask of him there--andthat it is well to be so. every profound spirit needs a mask; nay morearound every profound spirit there continually grows a mask owing tothe constantly false that is to say superficial interpretationof every word he utters every step he takes every sign of life hemanifests.. one must subject oneself to ones own tests that one is destinedfor independence and command and do so at the right time. one must notavoid ones tests although they constitute perhaps the most dangerousgame one can play and are in the end tests made only before ourselvesand before no other judge. not to cleave to any person be it even thedearest--every person is a prison and also a recess. not to cleave toa fatherland be it even the most suffering and necessitous--it is evenless difficult to detach ones heart from a victorious fatherland. notto cleave to a sympathy be it even for higher men into whose peculiartorture and helplessness chance has given us an insight. not to cleaveto a science though it tempt one with the most valuable discoveriesapparently specially reserved for us. not to cleave to ones ownliberation to the voluptuous distance and remoteness of the bird whichalways flies further aloft in order always to see more under it--thedanger of the flier. not to cleave to our own virtues nor become asa whole a victim to any of our specialties to our hospitality forinstance which is the danger of dangers for highly developedand wealthy souls who deal prodigally almost indifferently withthemselves and push the virtue of liberality so far that it becomesa vice. one must know how to conserve oneself--the best test ofindependence.. a new order of philosophers is appearing; i shall venture to baptizethem by a name not without danger. as far as i understand them as faras they allow themselves to be understood--for it is their nature towish to remain something of a puzzle--these philosophers of thefuture might rightly perhaps also wrongly claim to be designated astempters. this name itself is after all only an attempt or if it bepreferred a temptation.. will they be new friends of truth these coming philosophers veryprobably for all philosophers hitherto have loved their truths. butassuredly they will not be dogmatists. it must be contrary to theirpride and also contrary to their taste that their truth should stillbe truth for every one--that which has hitherto been the secret wishand ultimate purpose of all dogmatic efforts. my opinion is my opinion:another person has not easily a right to it--such a philosopher of thefuture will say perhaps. one must renounce the bad taste of wishing toagree with many people. good is no longer good when ones neighbourtakes it into his mouth. and how could there be a common good! theexpression contradicts itself; that which can be common is always ofsmall value. in the end things must be as they are and have alwaysbeen--the great things remain for the great the abysses for theprofound the delicacies and thrills for the refined and to sum upshortly everything rare for the rare.. need i say expressly after all this that they will be free veryfree spirits these philosophers of the future--as certainly also theywill not be merely free spirits but something more higher greaterand fundamentally different which does not wish to be misunderstood andmistaken but while i say this i feel under obligation almost as muchto them as to ourselves we free spirits who are their heralds andforerunners to sweep away from ourselves altogether a stupid oldprejudice and misunderstanding which like a fog has too long made theconception of free spirit obscure. in every country of europe and thesame in america there is at present something which makes an abuse ofthis name a very narrow prepossessed enchained class of spiritswho desire almost the opposite of what our intentions and instinctsprompt--not to mention that in respect to the new philosophers who areappearing they must still more be closed windows and bolted doors.briefly and regrettably they belong to the levellers these wronglynamed free spirits--as glib-tongued and scribe-fingered slaves ofthe democratic taste and its modern ideas all of them men withoutsolitude without personal solitude blunt honest fellows to whomneither courage nor honourable conduct ought to be denied only theyare not free and are ludicrously superficial especially in theirinnate partiality for seeing the cause of almost all human misery andfailure in the old forms in which society has hitherto existed--a notionwhich happily inverts the truth entirely! what they would fain attainwith all their strength is the universal green-meadow happiness of theherd together with security safety comfort and alleviation of lifefor every one their two most frequently chanted songs and doctrinesare called equality of rights and sympathy with all sufferers--andsuffering itself is looked upon by them as something which must bedone away with. we opposite ones however who have opened our eye andconscience to the question how and where the plant man has hithertogrown most vigorously believe that this has always taken place underthe opposite conditions that for this end the dangerousness of hissituation had to be increased enormously his inventive faculty anddissembling power his spirit had to develop into subtlety and daringunder long oppression and compulsion and his will to life had to beincreased to the unconditioned will to power--we believe that severityviolence slavery danger in the street and in the heart secrecystoicism tempters art and devilry of every kind--that everythingwicked terrible tyrannical predatory and serpentine in man servesas well for the elevation of the human species as its opposite--we donot even say enough when we only say this much and in any case wefind ourselves here both with our speech and our silence at the otherextreme of all modern ideology and gregarious desirability as theirantipodes perhaps what wonder that we free spirits are not exactlythe most communicative spirits that we do not wish to betray in everyrespect what a spirit can free itself from and where perhaps it willthen be driven and as to the import of the dangerous formula beyondgood and evil with which we at least avoid confusion we are somethingelse than libres-penseurs liben pensatori free-thinkersand whatever these honest advocates of modern

attained the heights depths and distances of theseexperiences the entire history of the soul up to the present timeand its still unexhausted possibilities: this is the preordainedhunting-domain for a born psychologist and lover of a big hunt. buthow often must he say despairingly to himself: a single individual!alas only a single individual! and this great forest this virginforest! so he would like to have some hundreds of hunting assistantsand fine trained hounds that he could send into the history of thehuman soul to drive his game together. in vain: again and again heexperiences profoundly and bitterly how difficult it is to findassistants and dogs for all the things that directly excite hiscuriosity. the evil of sending scholars into new and dangeroushunting-domains where courage sagacity and subtlety in every senseare required is that they are no longer serviceable just when the bighunt and also the great danger commences--it is precisely then thatthey lose their keen eye and nose. in order for instance to divine anddetermine what sort of history the problem of knowledge and consciencehas hitherto had in the souls of homines religiosi a person wouldperhaps himself have to possess as profound as bruised as immense anexperience as the intellectual conscience of pascal; and then he wouldstill require that wide-spread heaven of clear wicked spiritualitywhich from above would be able to oversee arrange and effectivelyformulize this mass of dangerous and painful experiences.--but whocould do me this service! and who would have time to wait for suchservants!--they evidently appear too rarely they are so improbable atall times! eventually one must do everything oneself in order to knowsomething; which means that one has much to do!--but a curiosity likemine is once for all the most agreeable of vices--pardon me! i mean tosay that the love of truth has its reward in heaven and already uponearth.. faith such as early christianity desired and not infrequentlyachieved in the midst of a skeptical and southernly free-spirited worldwhich had centuries of struggle between philosophical schools behindit and in it counting besides the education in tolerance whichthe imperium romanum gave--this faith is not that sincere austereslave-faith by which perhaps a luther or a cromwell or some othernorthern barbarian of the spirit remained attached to his god andchristianity it is much rather the faith of pascal which resembles ina terrible manner a continuous suicide of reason--a tough long-livedworm-like reason which is not to be slain at once and with a singleblow. the christian faith from the beginning is sacrifice the sacrificeof all freedom all pride all self-confidence of spirit it is atthe same time subjection self-derision and self-mutilation. there iscruelty and religious phoenicianism in this faith which is adapted to atender many-sided and very fastidious conscience it takes for grantedthat the subjection of the spirit is indescribably painful that all thepast and all the habits of such a spirit resist the absurdissimum inthe form of which faith comes to it. modern men with their obtusenessas regards all christian nomenclature have no longer the sense for theterribly superlative conception which was implied to an antique taste bythe paradox of the formula god on the cross. hitherto there had neverand nowhere been such boldness in inversion nor anything at once sodreadful questioning and questionable as this formula: it promised atransvaluation of all ancient values--it was the orient the profoundorient it was the oriental slave who thus took revenge on rome and itsnoble light-minded toleration on the roman catholicism of non-faithand it was always not the faith but the freedom from the faith thehalf-stoical and smiling indifference to the seriousness of the faithwhich made the slaves indignant at their masters and revolt againstthem. enlightenment causes revolt for the slave desires theunconditioned he understands nothing but the tyrannous even in moralshe loves as he hates without nuance to the very depths to the pointof pain to the point of sickness--his many hidden sufferings makehim revolt against the noble taste which seems to deny suffering. theskepticism with regard to suffering fundamentally only an attitude ofaristocratic morality was not the least of the causes also of thelast great slave-insurrection which began with the french revolution.. wherever the religious neurosis has appeared on the earth so farwe find it connected with three dangerous prescriptions as to regimen:solitude fasting and sexual abstinence--but without its being possibleto determine with certainty which is cause and which is effect or ifany relation at all of cause and effect exists there. this latter doubtis justified by the fact that one of the most regular symptoms amongsavage as well as among civilized peoples is the most sudden andexcessive sensuality which then with equal suddenness transforms intopenitential paroxysms world-renunciation and will-renunciation bothsymptoms perhaps explainable as disguised epilepsy but nowhere is itmore obligatory to put aside explanations around no other type has theregrown such a mass of absurdity and superstition no other type seems tohave been more interesting to men and even to philosophers--perhaps itis time to become just a little indifferent here to learn caution orbetter still to look away to go away--yet in the background of themost recent philosophy that of schopenhauer we find almost as theproblem in itself this terrible note of interrogation of the religiouscrisis and awakening. how is the negation of will possible how is thesaint possible--that seems to have been the very question with whichschopenhauer made a start and became a philosopher. and thus it was agenuine schopenhauerian consequence that his most convinced adherentperhaps also his last as far as germany is concerned namely richardwagner should bring his own life-work to an end just here and shouldfinally put that terrible and eternal type upon the stage as kundrytype vecu and as it loved and lived at the very time that themad-doctors in almost all european countries had an opportunity to studythe type close at hand wherever the religious neurosis--or as i callit the religious mood--made its latest epidemical outbreak anddisplay as the salvation army--if it be a question however as towhat has been so extremely interesting to men of all sorts in all agesand even to philosophers in the whole phenomenon of the saint itis undoubtedly the appearance of the miraculous therein--namely theimmediate succession of opposites of states of the soul regarded asmorally antithetical: it was believed here to be self-evident thata bad man was all at once turned into a saint a good man. thehitherto existing psychology was wrecked at this point is it notpossible it may have happened principally because psychology had placeditself under the dominion of morals because it believed in oppositionsof moral values and saw read and interpreted these oppositionsinto the text and facts of the case what miracle only an error ofinterpretation a lack of philology. it seems that the latin races are far more deeply attached to theircatholicism than we northerners are to christianity generally andthat consequently unbelief in catholic countries means something quitedifferent from what it does among protestants--namely a sort of revoltagainst the spirit of the race while with us it is rather a return tothe spirit or non-spirit of the race.we northerners undoubtedly derive our origin from barbarous races evenas regards our talents for religion--we have poor talents for it. onemay make an exception in the case of the celts who have theretoforefurnished also the best soil for christian infection in the north: thechristian ideal blossomed forth in france as much as ever the pale sunof the north would allow it. how strangely pious for our taste are stillthese later french skeptics whenever there is any celtic blood in theirorigin! how catholic how un-german does auguste comtes sociologyseem to us with the roman logic of its instincts! how jesuitical thatamiable and shrewd cicerone of port royal sainte-beuve in spite of allhis hostility to jesuits! and even ernest renan: how inaccessible tous northerners does the language of such a renan appear in whomevery instant the merest touch of religious thrill throws his refinedvoluptuous and comfortably couching soul off its balance! let us repeatafter him these fine sentences--and what wickedness and haughtiness isimmediately aroused by way of answer in our probably less beautiful butharder souls that is to say in our more german souls!--disons donchardiment que la religion est un produit de lhomme normal que lhommeest le plus dans le vrai quant il est le plus religieux et le plusassure dune destinee infinie.... cest quand il est bon quil veut quela virtu corresponde a un order eternal cest quand il contemple leschoses dune maniere desinteressee quil trouve la mort revoltante etabsurde. comment ne pas supposer que cest dans ces moments-la quelhomme voit le mieux... these sentences are so extremely antipodalto my ears and habits of thought that in my first impulse of rageon finding them i wrote on the margin la niaiserie religieuse parexcellence!--until in my later rage i even took a fancy to them thesesentences with their truth absolutely inverted! it is so nice and such adistinction to have ones own antipodes!. that which is so astonishing in the religious life of the ancientgreeks is the irrestrainable stream of gratitude which it poursforth--it is a very superior kind of man who takes such an attitudetowards nature and life.--later on when the populace got the upper handin greece fear became rampant also in religion; and christianity waspreparing itself.. the passion for god: there are churlish honest-hearted andimportunate kinds of it like that of luther--the whole of protestantismlacks the southern delicatezza. there is an oriental exaltation of themind in it like that of an undeservedly favoured or elevated slave asin the case of st. augustine for instance who lacks in an offensivemanner all nobility in bearing and desires. there is a femininetenderness and sensuality in it which modestly and unconsciously longsfor a unio mystica et physica as in the case of madame de guyon. inmany cases it appears curiously enough as the disguise of a girlsor youths puberty; here and there even as the hysteria of an old maidalso as her last ambition. the church has frequently canonized the womanin such a case.. the mightiest men have hitherto always bowed reverently beforethe saint as the enigma of self-subjugation and utter voluntaryprivation--why did they thus bow they divined in him--and as it werebehind the questionableness of his frail and wretched appearance--thesuperior force which wished to test itself by such a subjugation; thestrength of will in which they recognized their own strength andlove of power and knew how to honour it: they honoured somethingin themselves when they honoured the saint. in addition to this thecontemplation of the saint suggested to them a suspicion: such anenormity of self-negation and anti-naturalness will not have beencoveted for nothing--they have said inquiringly. there is perhaps areason for it some very great danger about which the ascetic mightwish to be more accurately informed through his secret interlocutors andvisitors in a word the mighty ones of the world learned to have a newfear before him they divined a new power a strange still unconqueredenemy:--it was the will to power which obliged them to halt before thesaint. they had to question him.. in the jewish old testament the book of divine justice there aremen things and sayings on such an immense scale that greek and indianliterature has nothing to compare with it. one stands with fear andreverence before those stupendous remains of what man was formerly andone has sad thoughts about old asia and its little out-pushed peninsulaeurope which would like by all means to figure before asia as theprogress of mankind. to be sure he who is himself only a slendertame house-animal and knows only the wants of a house-animal likeour cultured people of today including the christians of culturedchristianity need neither be amazed nor even sad amid those ruins--thetaste for the old testament is a touchstone with respect to great andsmall: perhaps he will find that the new testament the book of gracestill appeals more to his heart there is much of the odour of thegenuine tender stupid beadsman and petty soul in it. to have boundup this new testament a kind of rococo of taste in every respect alongwith the old testament into one book as the bible as the book initself is perhaps the greatest audacity and sin against the spiritwhich literary europe has upon its conscience.. why atheism nowadays the father in god is thoroughly refuted;equally so the judge the rewarder. also his free will: he doesnot hear--and even if he did he would not know how to help. the worstis that he seems incapable of communicating himself clearly; is heuncertain--this is what i have made out by questioning and listeningat a variety of conversations to be the cause of the decline ofeuropean theism; it appears to me that though the religious instinct isin vigorous growth--it rejects the theistic satisfaction with profounddistrust.. what does all modern philosophy mainly do since descartes--andindeed more in defiance of him than on the basis of his procedure--anattentat has been made on the part of all philosophers on the oldconception of the soul under the guise of a criticism of the subjectand predicate conception--that is to say an attentat on thefundamental presupposition of christian doctrine. modern philosophyas epistemological skepticism is secretly or openly anti-christianalthough for keener ears be it said by no means anti-religious.formerly in effect one believed in the soul as one believed ingrammar and the grammatical subject: one said i is the conditionthink is the predicate and is conditioned--to think is an activity forwhich one must suppose a subject as cause. the attempt was then madewith marvelous tenacity and subtlety to see if one could not get outof this net--to see if the opposite was not perhaps true: think thecondition and i the conditioned; i therefore only a synthesiswhich has been made by thinking itself. kant really wished to provethat starting from the subject the subject could not be proved--northe object either: the possibility of an apparent existence of thesubject and therefore of the soul may not always have been strangeto him--the thought which once had an immense power on earth as thevedanta philosophy.. there is a great ladder of religious cruelty with many rounds; butthree of these are the most important. once on a time men sacrificedhuman beings to their god and perhaps just those they loved thebest--to this category belong the firstling sacrifices of all primitivereligions and also the sacrifice of the emperor tiberius in themithra-grotto on the island of capri that most terrible of all romananachronisms. then during the moral epoch of mankind they sacrificedto their god the strongest instincts they possessed their nature;this festal joy shines in the cruel glances of ascetics andanti-natural fanatics. finally what still remained to be sacrificedwas it not necessary in the end for men to sacrifice everythingcomforting holy healing all hope all faith in hidden harmonies infuture blessedness and justice was it not necessary to sacrifice godhimself and out of cruelty to themselves to worship stone stupiditygravity fate nothingness to sacrifice god for nothingness--thisparadoxical mystery of the ultimate cruelty has been reserved for therising generation; we all know something thereof already.. whoever like myself prompted by some enigmatical desire has longendeavoured to go to the bottom of the question of pessimism and free itfrom the half-christian half-german narrowness and stupidity in whichit has finally presented itself to this century namely in the form ofschopenhauers philosophy; whoever with an asiatic and super-asiaticeye has actually looked inside and into the most world-renouncing ofall possible modes of thought--beyond good and evil and no longerlike buddha and schopenhauer under the dominion and delusion ofmorality--whoever has done this has perhaps just thereby withoutreally desiring it opened his eyes to behold the opposite ideal: theideal of the most world-approving exuberant and vivacious man who hasnot only learnt to compromise and arrange with that which was andis but wishes to have it again as it was and is for all eternityinsatiably calling out da capo not only to himself but to the wholepiece and play; and not only the play but actually to him who requiresthe play--and makes it necessary; because he always requireshimself anew--and makes himself necessary.--what and this would notbe--circulus vitiosus deus. the distance and as it were the space around man grows with thestrength of his intellectual vision and insight: his world becomesprofounder; new stars new enigmas and notions are ever coming intoview. perhaps everything on which the intellectual eye has exercisedits acuteness and profundity has just been an occasion for its exercisesomething of a game something for children and childish minds. perhapsthe most solemn conceptions that have caused the most fighting andsuffering the conceptions god and sin will one day seem to us ofno more importance than a childs plaything or a childs pain seems toan old man;--and perhaps another plaything and another pain will thenbe necessary once more for the old man--always childish enough aneternal child!. has it been observed to what extent outward idleness orsemi-idleness is necessary to a real religious life alike for itsfavourite microscopic labour of self-examination and for its softplacidity called prayer the state of perpetual readiness for thecoming of god i mean the idleness with a good conscience theidleness of olden times and of blood to which the aristocraticsentiment that work is dishonouring--that it vulgarizes body andsoul--is not quite unfamiliar and that consequently the modern noisytime-engrossing conceited foolishly proud laboriousness educatesand prepares for unbelief more than anything else among these forinstance who are at present living apart from religion in germany ifind free-thinkers of diversified species and origin but above alla majority of those in whom laboriousness from generation to generationhas dissolved the religious instincts; so that they no longer know whatpurpose religions serve and only note their existence in the worldwith a kind of dull astonishment. they feel themselves already fullyoccupied these good people be it by their business or by theirpleasures not to mention the fatherland and the newspapers andtheir family duties; it seems that they have no time whatever leftfor religion; and above all it is not obvious to them whether it is aquestion of a new business or a new pleasure--for it is impossible theysay to themselves that people should go to church merely to spoiltheir tempers. they are by no means enemies of religious customs;should certain circumstances state affairs perhaps require theirparticipation in such customs they do what is required as so manythings are done--with a patient and unassuming seriousness and withoutmuch curiosity or discomfort;--they live too much apart and outsideto feel even the necessity for a for or against in such matters. amongthose indifferent persons may be reckoned nowadays the majority ofgerman protestants of the middle classes especially in the greatlaborious centres of trade and commerce; also the majority of laboriousscholars and the entire university personnel with the exception ofthe theologians whose existence and possibility there always givespsychologists new and more subtle puzzles to solve. on the part ofpious or merely church-going people there is seldom any idea of howmuch good-will one might say arbitrary will is now necessary for agerman scholar to take the problem of religion seriously; his wholeprofession and as i have said his whole workmanlike laboriousness towhich he is compelled by his modern conscience inclines him to alofty and almost charitable serenity as regards religion with which isoccasionally mingled a slight disdain for the uncleanliness of spiritwhich he takes for granted wherever any one still professes to belongto the church. it is only with the help of history not through his ownpersonal experience therefore that the scholar succeeds in bringinghimself to a respectful seriousness and to a certain timid deferencein presence of religions; but even when his sentiments have reached thestage of gratitude towards them he has not personally advanced onestep nearer to that which still maintains itself as church or as piety;perhaps even the contrary. the practical indifference to religiousmatters in the midst of which he has been born and brought up usuallysublimates itself in his case into circumspection and cleanliness whichshuns contact with religious men and things; and it may be just thedepth of his tolerance and humanity which prompts him to avoid thedelicate trouble which tolerance itself brings with it.--every age hasits own divine type of naivete for the discovery of which other agesmay envy it: and how much naivete--adorable childlike and boundlesslyfoolish naivete is involved in this belief of the scholar inhis superiority in the good conscience of his tolerance in theunsuspecting simple certainty with which his instinct treats thereligious man as a lower and less valuable type beyond before andabove which he himself has developed--he the little arrogant dwarfand mob-man the sedulously alert head-and-hand drudge of ideas ofmodern ideas!. whoever has seen deeply into the world has doubtless divined whatwisdom there is in the fact that men are superficial. it is theirpreservative instinct which teaches them to be flighty lightsome andfalse. here and there one finds a passionate and exaggerated adorationof pure forms in philosophers as well as in artists: it is not to bedoubted that whoever has need of the cult of the superficial to thatextent has at one time or another made an unlucky dive beneath it.perhaps there is even an order of rank with respect to those burntchildren the born artists who find the enjoyment of life only in tryingto falsify its image as if taking wearisome revenge on it one mightguess to what degree life has disgusted them by the extent to whichthey wish to see its image falsified attenuated ultrified anddeified--one might reckon the homines religiosi among the artists astheir highest rank. it is the profound suspicious fear of an incurablepessimism which compels whole centuries to fasten their teeth into areligious interpretation of existence: the fear of the instinct whichdivines that truth might be attained too soon before man has becomestrong enough hard enough artist enough.... piety the life in godregarded in this light would appear as the most elaborate andultimate product of the fear of truth as artist-adorationand artist-intoxication in presence of the most logical of allfalsifications as the will to the inversion of truth to untruth atany price. perhaps there has hitherto been no more effective means ofbeautifying man than piety by means of it man can become so artful sosuperficial so iridescent and so good that his appearance no longeroffends.. to love mankind for gods sake--this has so far been the noblest andremotest sentiment to which mankind has attained. that love to mankindwithout any redeeming intention in the background is only an additionalfolly and brutishness that the inclination to this love has first toget its proportion its delicacy its gram of salt and sprinklingof ambergris from a higher inclination--whoever first perceivedand experienced this however his tongue may have stammered as itattempted to express such a delicate matter let him for all time beholy and respected as the man who has so far flown highest and goneastray in the finest fashion!. the philosopher as we free spirits understand him--as the man ofthe greatest responsibility who has the conscience for the generaldevelopment of mankind--will use religion for his disciplining andeducating work just as he will use the contemporary politicaland economic conditions. the selecting and disciplininginfluence--destructive as well as creative and fashioning--which can beexercised by means of religion is manifold and varied according to thesort of people placed under its spell and protection. for those who arestrong and independent destined and trained to command in whom thejudgment and skill of a ruling race is incorporated religion isan additional means for overcoming resistance in the exercise ofauthority--as a bond which binds rulers and subjects in commonbetraying and surrendering to the former the conscience of the lattertheir inmost heart which would fain escape obedience. and in thecase of the unique natures of noble origin if by virtue of superiorspirituality they should incline to a more retired and contemplativelife reserving to themselves only the more refined forms of governmentover chosen disciples or members of an order religion itself maybe used as a means for obtaining peace from the noise and trouble ofmanaging grosser affairs and for securing immunity from the unavoidablefilth of all political agitation. the brahmins for instance understoodthis fact. with the help of a religious organization they secured tothemselves the power of nominating kings for the people while theirsentiments prompted them to keep apart and outside as men with a higherand super-regal mission. at the same time religion gives inducement andopportunity to some of the subjects to qualify themselves for futureruling and commanding the slowly ascending ranks and classes in whichthrough fortunate marriage customs volitional power and delight inself-control are on the increase. to them religion offers sufficientincentives and temptations to aspire to higher intellectuality and toexperience the sentiments of authoritative self-control of silence andof solitude. asceticism and puritanism are almost indispensable means ofeducating and ennobling a race which seeks to rise above its hereditarybaseness and work itself upwards to future supremacy. and finally toordinary men to the majority of the people who exist for service andgeneral utility and are only so far entitled to exist religion givesinvaluable contentedness with their lot and condition peace of heartennoblement of obedience additional social happiness and sympathywith something of transfiguration and embellishment something ofjustification of all the commonplaceness all the meanness allthe semi-animal poverty of their souls. religion together with thereligious significance of life sheds sunshine over such perpetuallyharassed men and makes even their own aspect endurable to them itoperates upon them as the epicurean philosophy usually operates uponsufferers of a higher order in a refreshing and refining manneralmost turning suffering to account and in the end even hallowing andvindicating it. there is perhaps nothing so admirable in christianityand buddhism as their art of teaching even the lowest to elevatethemselves by piety to a seemingly higher order of things and therebyto retain their satisfaction with the actual world in which they find itdifficult enough to live--this very difficulty being necessary.. to be sure--to make also the bad counter-reckoning against suchreligions and to bring to light their secret dangers--the cost isalways excessive and terrible when religions do not operate as aneducational and disciplinary medium in the hands of the philosopher butrule voluntarily and paramountly when they wish to be the final endand not a means along with other means. among men as among all otheranimals there is a surplus of defective diseased degeneratinginfirm and necessarily suffering individuals; the successful casesamong men also are always the exception; and in view of the fact thatman is the animal not yet properly adapted to his environment the rareexception. but worse still. the higher the type a man represents thegreater is the improbability that he will succeed; the accidental thelaw of irrationality in the general constitution of mankind manifestsitself most terribly in its destructive effect on the higher orders ofmen the conditions of whose lives are delicate diverse and difficultto determine. what then is the attitude of the two greatest religionsabove-mentioned to the surplus of failures in life they endeavourto preserve and keep alive whatever can be preserved; in fact as thereligions for sufferers they take the part of these upon principle;they are always in favour of those who suffer from life as from adisease and they would fain treat every other experience of life asfalse and impossible. however highly we may esteem this indulgent andpreservative care inasmuch as in applying to others it has appliedand applies also to the highest and usually the most suffering type ofman the hitherto paramount religions--to give a general appreciationof them--are among the principal causes which have kept the type ofman upon a lower level--they have preserved too much that which shouldhave perished. one has to thank them for invaluable services; and who issufficiently rich in gratitude not to feel poor at the contemplationof all that the spiritual men of christianity have done for europehitherto! but when they had given comfort to the sufferers courage tothe oppressed and despairing a staff and support to the helplessand when they had allured from society into convents and spiritualpenitentiaries the broken-hearted and distracted: what else had theyto do in order to work systematically in that fashion and with a goodconscience for the preservation of all the sick and suffering whichmeans in deed and in truth to work for the deterioration of theeuropean race to reverse all estimates of value--that is what

finest stone! what have you presumedto do!--i should say that christianity has hitherto been the mostportentous of presumptions. men not great enough nor hard enoughto be entitled as artists to take part in fashioning man; mennot sufficiently strong and far-sighted to allow with sublimeself-constraint the obvious law of the thousandfold failures andperishings to prevail; men not sufficiently

moralsbelonging thereto is recent initial awkward and coarse-fingered:--aninteresting contrast which sometimes becomes incarnate and obviousin the very person of a moralist. indeed the expression scienceof morals is in respect to what is designated thereby far toopresumptuous and counter to good taste--which is always a foretaste ofmore modest expressions. one ought to avow with the utmost fairness whatis still necessary here for a long time what is alone proper for thepresent: namely the collection of material the comprehensive surveyand classification of an immense domain of delicate sentiments of worthand distinctions of worth which live grow propagate and perish--andperhaps attempts to give a clear idea of the recurring and more commonforms of these living crystallizations--as preparation for a theory oftypes of morality. to be sure people have not hitherto been so modest.all the philosophers with a pedantic and ridiculous seriousnessdemanded of themselves something very much higher more pretentious andceremonious when they concerned themselves with morality as a science:they wanted to give a basic to morality--and every philosopher hithertohas believed that he has given it a basis; morality itself however hasbeen regarded as something given. how far from their awkward pridewas the seemingly insignificant problem--left in dust and decay--of adescription of forms of morality notwithstanding that the finest handsand senses could hardly be fine enough for it! it was precisely owing tomoral philosophers knowing the moral facts imperfectly in an arbitraryepitome or an accidental abridgement--perhaps as the morality oftheir environment their position their church their zeitgeist theirclimate and zone--it was precisely because they were badly instructedwith regard to nations eras and past ages and were by no means eagerto know about these matters that they did not even come in sight of thereal problems of morals--problems which only disclose themselves bya comparison of many kinds of morality. in every science of moralshitherto strange as it may sound the problem of morality itselfhas been omitted: there has been no suspicion that there was anythingproblematic there! that which philosophers called giving a basis tomorality and endeavoured to realize has when seen in a right lightproved merely a learned form of good faith in prevailing morality a newmeans of its expression consequently just a matter-of-fact within thesphere of a definite morality yea in its ultimate motive a sort ofdenial that it is lawful for this morality to be called in question--andin any case the reverse of the testing analyzing doubting andvivisecting of this very faith. hear for instance with whatinnocence--almost worthy of honour--schopenhauer represents his owntask and draw your conclusions concerning the scientificness of ascience whose latest master still talks in the strain of children andold wives: the principle he says page  of the grundprobleme derethik footnote: pages - of schopenhauers basis of moralitytranslated by arthur b. bullock m.a. . the axiom about thepurport of which all moralists are practically agreed: neminem laedeimmo omnes quantum potes juva--is really the proposition which all moralteachers strive to establish ... the real basis of ethics whichhas been sought like the philosophers stone for centuries.--thedifficulty of establishing the proposition referred to may indeed begreat--it is well known that schopenhauer also was unsuccessful in hisefforts; and whoever has thoroughly realized how absurdly false andsentimental this proposition is in a world whose essence is willto power may be reminded that schopenhauer although a pessimistactually--played the flute... daily after dinner: one may read aboutthe matter in his biography. a question by the way: a pessimist arepudiator of god and of the world who makes a halt at morality--whoassents to morality and plays the flute to laede-neminem morals whatis that really--a pessimist. apart from the value of such assertions as there is a categoricalimperative in us one can always ask: what does such an assertionindicate about him who makes it there are systems of morals which aremeant to justify their author in the eyes of other people; other systemsof morals are meant to tranquilize him and make him self-satisfied;with other systems he wants to crucify and humble himself with othershe wishes to take revenge with others to conceal himself with othersto glorify himself and gave superiority and distinction--this system ofmorals helps its author to forget that system makes him or somethingof him forgotten many a moralist would like to exercise power andcreative arbitrariness over mankind many another perhaps kantespecially gives us to understand by his morals that what is estimablein me is that i know how to obey--and with you it shall not beotherwise than with me! in short systems of morals are only asign-language of the emotions.. in contrast to laisser-aller every system of morals is a sort oftyranny against nature and also against reason that is however noobjection unless one should again decree by some system of morals thatall kinds of tyranny and unreasonableness are unlawful what isessential and invaluable in every system of morals is that it is along constraint. in order to understand stoicism or port royalor puritanism one should remember the constraint under which everylanguage has attained to strength and freedom--the metrical constraintthe tyranny of rhyme and rhythm. how much trouble have the poets andorators of every nation given themselves!--not excepting some ofthe prose writers of today in whose ear dwells an inexorableconscientiousness--for the sake of a folly as utilitarian bunglerssay and thereby deem themselves wise--from submission to arbitrarylaws as the anarchists say and thereby fancy themselves free evenfree-spirited. the singular fact remains however that everythingof the nature of freedom elegance boldness dance and masterlycertainty which exists or has existed whether it be in thought itselfor in administration or in speaking and persuading in art just as inconduct has only developed by means of the tyranny of such arbitrarylaw and in all seriousness it is not at all improbable that preciselythis is nature and natural--and not laisser-aller! every artistknows how different from the state of letting himself go is hismost natural condition the free arranging locating disposingand constructing in the moments of inspiration--and how strictly anddelicately he then obeys a thousand laws which by their very rigidnessand precision defy all formulation by means of ideas even the moststable idea has in comparison therewith something floating manifoldand ambiguous in it. the essential thing in heaven and in earth isapparently to repeat it once more that there should be long obediencein the same direction there thereby results and has always resulted inthe long run something which has made life worth living; for instancevirtue art music dancing reason spirituality--anything whateverthat is transfiguring refined foolish or divine. the long bondage ofthe spirit the distrustful constraint in the communicability ofideas the discipline which the thinker imposed on himself to thinkin accordance with the rules of a church or a court or conformableto aristotelian premises the persistent spiritual will to interpreteverything that happened according to a christian scheme and in everyoccurrence to rediscover and justify the christian god:--all thisviolence arbitrariness severity dreadfulness and unreasonablenesshas proved itself the disciplinary means whereby the european spirit hasattained its strength its remorseless curiosity and subtle mobility;granted also that much irrecoverable strength and spirit had to bestifled suffocated and spoilt in the process for here as everywherenature shows herself as she is in all her extravagant and indifferentmagnificence which is shocking but nevertheless noble. thatfor centuries european thinkers only thought in order to provesomething--nowadays on the contrary we are suspicious of every thinkerwho wishes to prove something--that it was always settled beforehandwhat was to be the result of their strictest thinking as it was perhapsin the asiatic astrology of former times or as it is still at thepresent day in the innocent christian-moral explanation of immediatepersonal events for the glory of god or for the good of thesoul:--this tyranny this arbitrariness this severe and magnificentstupidity has educated the spirit; slavery both in the coarser andthe finer sense is apparently an indispensable means even of spiritualeducation and discipline. one may look at every system of morals in thislight: it is nature therein which teaches to hate the laisser-allerthe too great freedom and implants the need for limited horizons forimmediate duties--it teaches the narrowing of perspectives and thus ina certain sense that stupidity is a condition of life and development.thou must obey some one and for a long time; otherwise thou wilt cometo grief and lose all respect for thyself--this seems to me to be themoral imperative of nature which is certainly neither categoricalas old kant wished consequently the otherwise nor does it addressitself to the individual what does nature care for the individual!but to nations races ages and ranks; above all however to theanimal man generally to mankind.. industrious races find it a great hardship to be idle: it was amaster stroke of english instinct to hallow and begloom sunday to suchan extent that the englishman unconsciously hankers for his week--andwork-day again:--as a kind of cleverly devised cleverly intercalatedfast such as is also frequently found in the ancient world althoughas is appropriate in southern nations not precisely with respectto work. many kinds of fasts are necessary; and wherever powerfulinfluences and habits prevail legislators have to see that intercalarydays are appointed on which such impulses are fettered and learn tohunger anew. viewed from a higher standpoint whole generations andepochs when they show themselves infected with any moral fanaticismseem like those intercalated periods of restraint and fasting duringwhich an impulse learns to humble and submit itself--at the same timealso to purify and sharpen itself; certain philosophical sects likewiseadmit of a similar interpretation for instance the stoa in the midstof hellenic culture with the atmosphere rank and overcharged withaphrodisiacal odours.--here also is a hint for the explanation of theparadox why it was precisely in the most christian period of europeanhistory and in general only under the pressure of christian sentimentsthat the sexual impulse sublimated into love amour-passion.. there is something in the morality of plato which does not reallybelong to plato but which only appears in his philosophy one mightsay in spite of him: namely socratism for which he himself wastoo noble. no one desires to injure himself hence all evil is doneunwittingly. the evil man inflicts injury on himself; he would not doso however if he knew that evil is evil. the evil man therefore isonly evil through error; if one free him from error one will necessarilymake him--good.--this mode of reasoning savours of the populace whoperceive only the unpleasant consequences of evil-doing and practicallyjudge that it is stupid to do wrong; while they accept good asidentical with useful and pleasant without further thought. asregards every system of utilitarianism one may at once assume that ithas the same origin and follow the scent: one will seldom err.--platodid all he could to interpret something refined and noble into thetenets of his teacher and above all to interpret himself into them--hethe most daring of all interpreters who lifted the entire socrates outof the street as a popular theme and song to exhibit him in endlessand impossible modifications--namely in all his own disguises andmultiplicities. in jest and in homeric language as well what is theplatonic socrates if not--greek words inserted here.. the old theological problem of faith and knowledge or moreplainly of instinct and reason--the question whether in respect to thevaluation of things instinct deserves more authority than rationalitywhich wants to appreciate and act according to motives according toa why that is to say in conformity to purpose and utility--itis always the old moral problem that first appeared in the person ofsocrates and had divided mens minds long before christianity. socrateshimself following of course the taste of his talent--that of asurpassing dialectician--took first the side of reason; and in factwhat did he do all his life but laugh at the awkward incapacity of thenoble athenians who were men of instinct like all noble men and couldnever give satisfactory answers concerning the motives of their actionsin the end however though silently and secretly he laughed alsoat himself: with his finer conscience and introspection he foundin himself the same difficulty and incapacity. but why--he saidto himself--should one on that account separate oneself from theinstincts! one must set them right and the reason also--one must followthe instincts but at the same time persuade the reason to support themwith good arguments. this was the real falseness of that great andmysterious ironist; he brought his conscience up to the point that hewas satisfied with a kind of self-outwitting: in fact he perceivedthe irrationality in the moral judgment.--plato more innocent in suchmatters and without the craftiness of the plebeian wished to prove tohimself at the expenditure of all his strength--the greatest strengtha philosopher had ever expended--that reason and instinct leadspontaneously to one goal to the good to god; and since plato alltheologians and philosophers have followed the same path--which meansthat in matters of morality instinct or as christians call itfaith or as i call it the herd has hitherto triumphed. unlessone should make an exception in the case of descartes the father ofrationalism and consequently the grandfather of the revolution whorecognized only the authority of reason: but reason is only a tool anddescartes was superficial.. whoever has followed the history of a single science finds inits development a clue to the understanding of the oldest and commonestprocesses of all knowledge and cognizance: there as here thepremature hypotheses the fictions the good stupid will to beliefand the lack of distrust and patience are first developed--our senseslearn late and never learn completely to be subtle reliable andcautious organs of knowledge. our eyes find it easier on a givenoccasion to produce a picture already often produced than to seize uponthe divergence and novelty of an impression: the latter requires moreforce more morality. it is difficult and painful for the ear tolisten to anything new; we hear strange music badly. when we hearanother language spoken we involuntarily attempt to form the soundsinto words with which we are more familiar and conversant--it was thusfor example that the germans modified the spoken word arcubalista intoarmbrust cross-bow. our senses are also hostile and averse to thenew; and generally even in the simplest processes of sensation theemotions dominate--such as fear love hatred and the passive emotionof indolence.--as little as a reader nowadays reads all the single wordsnot to speak of syllables of a page--he rather takes about five outof every twenty words at random and guesses the probably appropriatesense to them--just as little do we see a tree correctly and completelyin respect to its leaves branches colour and shape; we find it somuch easier to fancy the chance of a tree. even in the midst of themost remarkable experiences we still do just the same; we fabricate thegreater part of the experience and can hardly be made to contemplateany event except as inventors thereof. all this goes to provethat from our fundamental nature and from remote ages we havebeen--accustomed to lying. or to express it more politely andhypocritically in short more pleasantly--one is much more of an artistthan one is aware of.--in an animated conversation i often see the faceof the person with whom i am speaking so clearly and sharply definedbefore me according to the thought he expresses or which i believe tobe evoked in his mind that the degree of distinctness far exceeds thestrength of my visual faculty--the delicacy of the play of the musclesand of the expression of the eyes must therefore be imagined by me.probably the person put on quite a different expression or none at all.. quidquid luce fuit tenebris agit: but also contrariwise. what weexperience in dreams provided we experience it often pertains atlast just as much to the general belongings of our soul as anythingactually experienced; by virtue thereof we are richer or poorer wehave a requirement more or less and finally in broad daylight andeven in the brightest moments of our waking life we are ruled to someextent by the nature of our dreams. supposing that someone has oftenflown in his dreams and that at last as soon as he dreams he isconscious of the power and art of flying as his privilege and hispeculiarly enviable happiness; such a person who believes that on theslightest impulse he can actualize all sorts of curves and angles whoknows the sensation of a certain divine levity an upwardswithout effort or constraint a downwards without descendingor lowering--without trouble!--how could the man with suchdream-experiences and dream-habits fail to find happiness differentlycoloured and defined even in his waking hours! how could he fail--tolong differently for happiness flight such as is described by poetsmust when compared with his own flying be far too earthly muscularviolent far too troublesome for him.. the difference among men does not manifest itself only in thedifference of their lists of desirable things--in their regardingdifferent good things as worth striving for and being disagreed as tothe greater or less value the order of rank of the commonly recognizeddesirable things:--it manifests itself much more in what they regard asactually having and possessing a desirable thing. as regards a womanfor instance the control over her body and her sexual gratificationserves as an amply sufficient sign of ownership and possession to themore modest man; another with a more suspicious and ambitious thirst forpossession sees the questionableness the mere apparentness of suchownership and wishes to have finer tests in order to know especiallywhether the woman not only gives herself to him but also gives up forhis sake what she has or would like to have--only then does he look uponher as possessed. a third however has not even here got to the limitof his distrust and his desire for possession: he asks himself whetherthe woman when she gives up everything for him does not perhaps doso for a phantom of him; he wishes first to be thoroughly indeedprofoundly well known; in order to be loved at all he ventures to lethimself be found out. only then does he feel the beloved one fully inhis possession when she no longer deceives herself about him whenshe loves him just as much for the sake of his devilry and concealedinsatiability as for his goodness patience and spirituality. oneman would like to possess a nation and he finds all the higher arts ofcagliostro and catalina suitable for his purpose. another with a morerefined thirst for possession says to himself: one may not deceivewhere one desires to possess--he is irritated and impatient at the ideathat a mask of him should rule in the hearts of the people: i musttherefore make myself known and first of all learn to know myself!among helpful and charitable people one almost always finds the awkwardcraftiness which first gets up suitably him who has to be helped asthough for instance he should merit help seek just their help andwould show himself deeply grateful attached and subservient to themfor all help. with these conceits they take control of the needy as aproperty just as in general they are charitable and helpful out of adesire for property. one finds them jealous when they are crossed orforestalled in their charity. parents involuntarily make something likethemselves out of their children--they call that education; no motherdoubts at the bottom of her heart that the child she has borne isthereby her property no father hesitates about his right to his ownideas and notions of worth. indeed in former times fathers deemed itright to use their discretion concerning the life or death of the newlyborn as among the ancient germans. and like the father so also do theteacher the class the priest and the prince still see in every newindividual an unobjectionable opportunity for a new possession. theconsequence is.... the jews--a people born for slavery as tacitus and the wholeancient world say of them; the chosen people among the nations asthey themselves say and believe--the jews performed the miracle of theinversion of valuations by means of which life on earth obtained a newand dangerous charm for a couple of millenniums. their prophets fusedinto one the expressions rich godless wicked violentsensual and for the first time coined the word world as a term ofreproach. in this inversion of valuations in which is also includedthe use of the word poor as synonymous with saint and friend thesignificance of the jewish people is to be found; it is with them thatthe slave-insurrection in morals commences.. it is to be inferred that there are countless dark bodies near thesun--such as we shall never see. among ourselves this is an allegory;and the psychologist of morals reads the whole star-writing merely as anallegorical and symbolic language in which much may be unexpressed.. the beast of prey and the man of prey for instance caesar borgiaare fundamentally misunderstood nature is misunderstood so long asone seeks a morbidness in the constitution of these healthiest ofall tropical monsters and growths or even an innate hell in them--asalmost all moralists have done hitherto. does it not seem that there isa hatred of the virgin forest and of the tropics among moralists andthat the tropical man must be discredited at all costs whetheras disease and deterioration of mankind or as his own hell andself-torture and why in favour of the temperate zones in favourof the temperate men the moral the mediocre--this for the chapter:morals as timidity.. all the systems of morals which address themselves with a view totheir happiness as it is called--what else are they but suggestionsfor behaviour adapted to the degree of danger from themselves in whichthe individuals live; recipes for their passions their good and badpropensities insofar as such have the will to power and would liketo play the master; small and great expediencies and elaborationspermeated with the musty odour of old family medicines and old-wifewisdom; all of them grotesque and absurd in their form--becausethey address themselves to all because they generalize wheregeneralization is not authorized; all of them speaking unconditionallyand taking themselves unconditionally; all of them flavoured not merelywith one grain of salt but rather endurable only and sometimes evenseductive when they are over-spiced and begin to smell dangerouslyespecially of the other world. that is all of little value whenestimated intellectually and is far from being science much lesswisdom; but repeated once more and three times repeated it isexpediency expediency expediency mixed with stupidity stupiditystupidity--whether it be the indifference and statuesque coldnesstowards the heated folly of the emotions which the stoics advised andfostered; or the no-more-laughing and no-more-weeping of spinoza thedestruction of the emotions by their analysis and vivisection which herecommended so naively; or the lowering of the emotions to an innocentmean at which they may be satisfied the aristotelianism of morals;or even morality as the enjoyment of the emotions in a voluntaryattenuation and spiritualization by the symbolism of art perhaps asmusic or as love of god and of mankind for gods sake--for in religionthe passions are once more enfranchised provided that...; or finallyeven the complaisant and wanton surrender to the emotions as hasbeen taught by hafis and goethe the bold letting-go of the reins thespiritual and corporeal licentia morum in the exceptional cases ofwise old codgers and drunkards with whom it no longer has muchdanger.--this also for the chapter: morals as timidity.. inasmuch as in all ages as long as mankind has existed there havealso been human herds family alliances communities tribes peoplesstates churches and always a great number who obey in proportionto the small number who command--in view therefore of the fact thatobedience has been most practiced and fostered among mankind hithertoone may reasonably suppose that generally speaking the need thereof isnow innate in every one as a kind of formal conscience which givesthe command thou shalt unconditionally do something unconditionallyrefrain from something in short thou shalt. this need tries tosatisfy itself and to fill its form with a content according to itsstrength impatience and eagerness it at once seizes as an omnivorousappetite with little selection and accepts whatever is shouted intoits ear by all sorts of commanders--parents teachers laws classprejudices or public opinion. the extraordinary limitation of humandevelopment the hesitation protractedness frequent retrogression andturning thereof is attributable to the fact that the herd-instinct ofobedience is transmitted best and at the cost of the art of command. ifone imagine this instinct increasing to its greatest extent commandersand independent individuals will finally be lacking altogether or theywill suffer inwardly from a bad conscience and will have to imposea deception on themselves in the first place in order to be able tocommand just as if they also were only obeying. this condition of thingsactually exists in europe at present--i call it the moral hypocrisy ofthe commanding class. they know no other way of protecting themselvesfrom their bad conscience than by playing the role of executors of olderand higher orders of predecessors of the constitution of justice ofthe law or of god himself or they even justify themselves by maximsfrom the current opinions of the herd as first servants of theirpeople or instruments of the public weal. on the other hand thegregarious european man nowadays assumes an air as if he were the onlykind of man that is allowable he glorifies his qualities such aspublic spirit kindness deference industry temperance modestyindulgence sympathy by virtue of which he is gentle endurable anduseful to the herd as the peculiarly human virtues. in cases howeverwhere it is believed that the leader and bell-wether cannot be dispensedwith attempt after attempt is made nowadays to replace commandersby the summing together of clever gregarious men all representativeconstitutions for example are of this origin. in spite of all what ablessing what a deliverance from a weight becoming unendurable is theappearance of an absolute ruler for these gregarious europeans--of thisfact the effect of the appearance of napoleon was the last great proofthe history of the influence of napoleon is almost the history ofthe higher happiness to which the entire century has attained in itsworthiest individuals and periods.. the man of an age of dissolution which mixes the races withone another who has the inheritance of a diversified descent in hisbody--that is to say contrary and often not only contrary instinctsand standards of value which struggle with one another and are seldomat peace--such a man of late culture and broken lights will on anaverage be a weak man. his fundamental desire is that the war which isin him should come to an end; happiness appears to him in the characterof a soothing medicine and mode of thought for instance epicureanor christian; it is above all things the happiness of repose ofundisturbedness of repletion of final unity--it is the sabbath ofsabbaths to use the expression of the holy rhetorician st. augustinewho was himself such a man.--should however the contrariety andconflict in such natures operate as an additional incentive and stimulusto life--and if on the other hand in addition to their powerful andirreconcilable instincts they have also inherited and indoctrinatedinto them a proper mastery and subtlety for carrying on the conflictwith themselves that is to say the faculty of self-control andself-deception there then arise those marvelously incomprehensible andinexplicable beings those enigmatical men predestined for conqueringand circumventing others the finest examples of which are alcibiadesand caesar with whom i should like to associate the first of europeansaccording to my taste the hohenstaufen frederick the second andamong artists perhaps leonardo da vinci. they appear precisely in thesame periods when that weaker type with its longing for repose comesto the front; the two types are complementary to each other and springfrom the same causes.. as long as the utility which determines moral estimates is onlygregarious utility as long as the preservation of the community is onlykept in view and the immoral is sought precisely and exclusively inwhat seems dangerous to the maintenance of the community there can beno morality of love to ones neighbour. granted even that there isalready a little constant exercise of consideration sympathy fairnessgentleness and mutual assistance granted that even in this conditionof society all those instincts are already active which are latterlydistinguished by honourable names as virtues and eventually almostcoincide with the conception morality: in that period they do notas yet belong to the domain of moral valuations--they are stillultra-moral. a sympathetic action for instance is neither called goodnor bad moral nor immoral in the best period of the romans; and shouldit be praised a sort of resentful disdain is compatible with thispraise even at the best directly the sympathetic action is comparedwith one which contributes to the welfare of the whole to the respublica. after all love to our neighbour is always a secondarymatter partly conventional and arbitrarily manifested in relation toour fear of our neighbour. after the fabric of society seems on thewhole established and secured against external dangers it is thisfear of our neighbour which again creates new perspectives of moralvaluation. certain strong and dangerous instincts such as the love ofenterprise foolhardiness revengefulness astuteness rapacity andlove of power which up till then had not only to be honoured from thepoint of view of general utility--under other names of course thanthose here given--but had to be fostered and cultivated because theywere perpetually required in the common danger against the commonenemies are now felt in their dangerousness to be doubly strong--whenthe outlets for them are lacking--and are gradually branded as immoraland given over to calumny. the contrary instincts and inclinations nowattain to moral honour the gregarious instinct gradually draws itsconclusions. how much or how little dangerousness to the community orto equality is contained in an opinion a condition an emotion adisposition or an endowment--that is now the moral perspective hereagain fear is the mother of morals. it is by the loftiest and strongestinstincts when they break out passionately and carry the individualfar above and beyond the average and the low level of the gregariousconscience that the self-reliance of the community is destroyed itsbelief in itself its backbone as it were breaks consequently thesevery instincts will be most branded and defamed. the lofty independentspirituality the will to stand alone and even the cogent reason arefelt to be dangers everything that elevates the individual above theherd and is a source of fear to the neighbour is henceforth calledevil the tolerant unassuming self-adapting self-equalizingdisposition the mediocrity of desires attains to moral distinction andhonour. finally under very peaceful circumstances there is alwaysless opportunity and necessity for training the feelings to severityand rigour and now every form of severity even in justice beginsto disturb the conscience a lofty and rigorous nobleness andself-responsibility almost offends and awakens distrust the lamband still more the sheep wins respect. there is a point of diseasedmellowness and effeminacy in the history of society at which societyitself takes the part of him who injures it the part of the criminaland does so in fact seriously and honestly. to punish appears to itto be somehow unfair--it is certain that the idea of punishment andthe obligation to punish are then painful and alarming to people. isit not sufficient if the criminal be rendered harmless why should westill punish punishment itself is terrible!--with these questionsgregarious morality the morality of fear draws its ultimateconclusion. if one could at all do away with danger the cause of fearone would have done away with this morality at the same time itwould no longer be necessary it would not consider itself any longernecessary!--whoever examines the conscience of the present-day europeanwill always elicit the same imperative from its thousand moral foldsand hidden recesses the imperative of the timidity of the herd we wishthat some time or other there may be nothing more to fear! some timeor other--the will and the way thereto is nowadays called progress allover europe.. let us at once say again what we have already said a hundredtimes for peoples ears nowadays are unwilling to hear such truths--ourtruths. we know well enough how offensive it sounds when any oneplainly and without metaphor counts man among the animals but it willbe accounted to us almost a crime that it is precisely in respect tomen of modern ideas that we have constantly applied the terms herdherd-instincts and such like expressions. what avail is it we cannotdo otherwise for it is precisely here that our new insight is. wehave found that in all the principal moral judgments europe has becomeunanimous including likewise the countries where european influenceprevails in europe people evidently know what socrates thought hedid not know and what the famous serpent of old once promised toteach--they know today what is good and evil. it must then sound hardand be distasteful to the ear when we always insist that that whichhere thinks it knows that which here glorifies itself with praiseand blame and calls itself good is the instinct of the herding humananimal the instinct which has come and is ever coming more and moreto the front to preponderance and supremacy over other instinctsaccording to the increasing physiological approximation and resemblanceof which it is the symptom. morality in europe at present isherding-animal morality and therefore as we understand the matteronly one kind of human morality beside which before which and afterwhich many other moralities and above all higher moralities are orshould be possible. against such a possibility against such a shouldbe however this morality defends itself with all its strength itsays obstinately and inexorably i am morality itself and nothing elseis morality! indeed with the help of a religion which has humouredand flattered the sublimest desires of the herding-animal things havereached such a point that we always find a more visible expression ofthis morality even in political and social arrangements: the democraticmovement is the inheritance of the christian movement. that its tempohowever is much too slow and sleepy for the more impatient ones forthose who are sick and distracted by the herding-instinct is indicatedby the increasingly furious howling and always less disguisedteeth-gnashing of the anarchist dogs who are now roving through thehighways of european culture. apparently in opposition to the peacefullyindustrious democrats and revolution-ideologues and still more soto the awkward philosophasters and fraternity-visionaries who callthemselves socialists and want a free society those are really at onewith them all in their thorough and instinctive hostility to every formof society other than that of the autonomous herd to the extent even ofrepudiating the notions master and servant--ni dieu ni maitre saysa socialist formula; at one in their tenacious opposition to everyspecial claim every special right and privilege this means ultimatelyopposition to every right for when all are equal no one needs rightsany longer; at one in their distrust of punitive justice as though itwere a violation of the weak unfair to the necessary consequences ofall former society; but equally at one in their religion of sympathyin their compassion for all that feels lives and suffers down to thevery animals up even to god--the extravagance of sympathy forgod belongs to a democratic age; altogether at one in the cry andimpatience of their sympathy in their deadly hatred of sufferinggenerally in their almost feminine incapacity for witnessing it orallowing it; at one in their involuntary beglooming and heart-softeningunder the spell of which europe seems to be threatened with a newbuddhism; at one in their belief in the morality of mutual sympathy asthough it were morality in itself the climax the attained climax ofmankind the sole hope of the future the consolation of the presentthe great discharge from all the obligations of the past; altogether atone in their belief in the community as the deliverer in the herd andtherefore in themselves.. we who hold a different belief--we who regard the democraticmovement not only as a degenerating form of political organization butas equivalent to a degenerating a waning type of man as involving hismediocrising and depreciation: where have we to fix our hopes innew philosophers--there is no other alternative: in minds strong andoriginal enough to initiate opposite estimates of value to transvalueand invert eternal valuations; in forerunners in men of the futurewho in the present shall fix the constraints and fasten the knots whichwill compel millenniums to take new paths. to teach man the futureof humanity as his will as depending on human will and to makepreparation for vast hazardous enterprises and collective attempts inrearing and educating in order thereby to put an end to the frightfulrule of folly and chance which has hitherto gone by the name ofhistory the folly of the greatest number is only its lastform--for that purpose a new type of philosopher and commander willsome time or other be needed at the very idea of which everything thathas existed in the way of occult terrible and benevolent beings mightlook pale and dwarfed. the image of such leaders hovers before oureyes:--is it lawful for me to say it aloud ye free spirits theconditions which one would partly have to create and partly utilize fortheir genesis; the presumptive methods and tests by virtue of whicha soul should grow up to such an elevation and power as to feel aconstraint to these tasks; a transvaluation of values under the newpressure and hammer of which a conscience should be steeled and a hearttransformed into brass so as to bear the weight of such responsibility;and on the other hand the necessity for such leaders the dreadfuldanger that they might be lacking or miscarry and degenerate:--theseare our real anxieties and glooms ye know it well ye free spirits!these are the heavy distant thoughts and storms which sweep across theheaven of our life. there are few pains so grievous as to have seendivined or experienced how an exceptional man has missed his way anddeteriorated; but he who has the rare eye for the universal dangerof man himself deteriorating he who like us has recognized theextraordinary fortuitousness which has hitherto played its game inrespect to the future of mankind--a game in which neither the hand noreven a finger of god has participated!--he who divines the fate thatis hidden under the idiotic unwariness and blind confidence ofmodern ideas and still more under the whole of christo-europeanmorality--suffers from an anguish with which no other is to be compared.he sees at a glance all that could still be made out of man througha favourable accumulation and augmentation of human powers andarrangements; he knows with all the knowledge of his conviction howunexhausted man still is for the greatest possibilities and how oftenin the past the type man has stood in presence of mysterious decisionsand new paths:--he knows still better from his painfulest recollectionson what wretched obstacles promising developments of the highest rankhave hitherto usually gone to pieces broken down sunk and becomecontemptible. the universal degeneracy of mankind to the level ofthe man of the future--as idealized by the socialistic fools andshallow-pates--this degeneracy and dwarfing of man to an absolutelygregarious animal or as they call it to a man of free societythis brutalizing of man into a pigmy with equal rights and claims isundoubtedly possible! he who has thought out this possibility to itsultimate conclusion knows another loathing unknown to the rest ofmankind--and perhaps also a new mission!chapter vi. we scholars. at the risk that moralizing may also reveal itself here as thatwhich it has always been--namely resolutely montrer ses plaiesaccording to balzac--i would venture to protest against an improper andinjurious alteration of rank which quite unnoticed and as if with thebest conscience threatens nowadays to establish itself in the relationsof science and philosophy. i mean to say that one must have the rightout of ones own experience--experience as it seems to me alwaysimplies unfortunate experience--to treat of such an important questionof rank so as not to speak of colour like the blind or against sciencelike women and artists ah! this dreadful science! sigh their instinctand their shame it always finds things out!. the declaration ofindependence of the scientific man his emancipation from philosophyis one of the subtler after-effects of democratic organization anddisorganization: the self-glorification and self-conceitedness ofthe learned man is now everywhere in full bloom and in its bestspringtime--which does not mean to imply that in this case self-praisesmells sweet. here also the instinct of the populace cries freedomfrom all masters! and after science has with the happiest resultsresisted theology whose hand-maid it had been too long it nowproposes in its wantonness and indiscretion to lay down laws forphilosophy and in its turn to play the master--what am i saying!to play the philosopher on its own account. my memory--the memory ofa scientific man if you please!--teems with the naivetes of insolencewhich i have heard about philosophy and philosophers from youngnaturalists and old physicians not to mention the most cultured andmost conceited of all learned men the philologists and schoolmasterswho are both the one and the other by profession. on one occasion itwas the specialist and the jack horner who instinctively stood on thedefensive against all synthetic tasks and capabilities; at another timeit was the industrious worker who had got a scent of otium and refinedluxuriousness in the internal economy of the philosopher and felthimself aggrieved and belittled thereby. on another occasion it was thecolour-blindness of the utilitarian who sees nothing in philosophy buta series of refuted systems and an extravagant expenditure which doesnobody any good. at another time the fear of disguised mysticism and ofthe boundary-adjustment of knowledge became conspicuous at anothertime the disregard of individual philosophers which had involuntarilyextended to disregard of philosophy generally. in fine i found mostfrequently behind the proud disdain of philosophy in young scholarsthe evil after-effect of some particular philosopher to whom on thewhole obedience had been foresworn without however the spell of hisscornful estimates of other philosophers having been got rid of--theresult being a general ill-will to all philosophy. such seems tome for instance the after-effect of schopenhauer on the most moderngermany: by his unintelligent rage against hegel he has succeeded insevering the whole of the last generation of germans from its connectionwith german culture which culture all things considered has beenan elevation and a divining refinement of the historical sense butprecisely at this point schopenhauer himself was poor irreceptiveand un-german to the extent of ingeniousness. on the whole speakinggenerally it may just have been the humanness all-too-humanness of themodern philosophers themselves in short their contemptibleness whichhas injured most radically the reverence for philosophy and opened thedoors to the instinct of the populace. let it but be acknowledged towhat an extent our modern world diverges from the whole style of theworld of heraclitus plato empedocles and whatever else all the royaland magnificent anchorites of the spirit were called and with whatjustice an honest man of science may feel himself of a better family andorigin in view of such representatives of philosophy who owing tothe fashion of the present day are just as much aloft as they are downbelow--in germany for instance the two lions of berlin the anarchisteugen duhring and the amalgamist eduard von hartmann. it is especiallythe sight of those hotch-potch philosophers who call themselvesrealists or positivists which is calculated to implant adangerous distrust in the soul of a young and ambitious scholar thosephilosophers at the best are themselves but scholars and specialiststhat is very evident! all of them are persons who have been vanquishedand brought back again under the dominion of science who at one timeor another claimed more from themselves without having a right to themore and its responsibility--and who now creditably rancorously andvindictively represent in word and deed disbelief in the master-taskand supremacy of philosophy after all how could it be otherwisescience flourishes nowadays and has the good conscience clearly visibleon its countenance while that to which the entire modern philosophy hasgradually sunk the remnant of philosophy of the present day excitesdistrust and displeasure if not scorn and pity philosophy reduced toa theory of knowledge no more in fact than a diffident science ofepochs and doctrine of forbearance a philosophy that never evengets beyond the threshold and rigorously denies itself the rightto enter--that is philosophy in its last throes an end an agonysomething that awakens pity. how could such a philosophy--rule!. the dangers that beset the evolution of the philosopher are infact so manifold nowadays that one might doubt whether this fruitcould still come to maturity. the extent and towering structure of thesciences have increased enormously and therewith also the probabilitythat the philosopher will grow tired even as a learner or will attachhimself somewhere and specialize so that he will no longer attain tohis elevation that is to say to his superspection his circumspectionand his despection. or he gets aloft too late when the best of hismaturity and strength is past or when he is impaired coarsened anddeteriorated so that his view his general estimate of things is nolonger of much importance. it is perhaps just the refinement of hisintellectual conscience that makes him hesitate and linger on theway he dreads the temptation to become a dilettante a millepede amilleantenna he knows too well that as a discerner one who has losthis self-respect no longer commands no longer leads unless he shouldaspire to become a great play-actor a philosophical cagliostro andspiritual rat-catcher--in short a misleader. this is in the lastinstance a question of taste if it has not really been a question ofconscience. to double once more the philosophers difficulties there isalso the fact that he demands from himself a verdict a yea or nay notconcerning science but concerning life and the worth of life--he learnsunwillingly to believe that it is his right and even his duty to obtainthis verdict and he has to seek his way to the right and the beliefonly through the most extensive perhaps disturbing and destroyingexperiences often hesitating doubting and dumbfounded. in fact thephilosopher has long been mistaken and confused by the multitude eitherwith the scientific man and ideal scholar or with the religiouslyelevated desensualized desecularized visionary and god-intoxicatedman; and even yet when one hears anybody praised because he liveswisely or as a philosopher it hardly means anything more thanprudently and apart. wisdom: that seems to the populace to be a kindof flight a means and artifice for withdrawing successfully from abad game; but the genuine philosopher--does it not seem so to usmy friends--lives unphilosophically and unwisely above allimprudently and feels the obligation and burden of a hundred attemptsand temptations of life--he risks himself constantly he plays this badgame.. in relation to the genius that is to say a being who eitherengenders or produces--both words understood in their fullest sense--theman of learning the scientific average man has always something ofthe old maid about him; for like her he is not conversant with the twoprincipal functions of man. to both of course to the scholar andto the old maid one concedes respectability as if by way ofindemnification--in these cases one emphasizes the respectability--andyet in the compulsion of this concession one has the same admixtureof vexation. let us examine more closely: what is the scientific manfirstly a commonplace type of man with commonplace virtues: that isto say a non-ruling non-authoritative and non-self-sufficient typeof man; he possesses industry patient adaptableness to rank and fileequability and moderation in capacity and requirement; he has theinstinct for people like himself and for that which they require--forinstance: the portion of independence and green meadow without whichthere is no rest from labour the claim to honour and considerationwhich first and foremost presupposes recognition and recognisabilitythe sunshine of a good name the perpetual ratification of his value andusefulness with which the inward distrust which lies at the bottom ofthe heart of all dependent men and gregarious animals has again andagain to be overcome. the learned man as is appropriate has alsomaladies and faults of an ignoble kind: he is full of petty envy andhas a lynx-eye for the weak points in those natures to whose elevationshe cannot attain. he is confiding yet only as one who lets himself gobut does not flow; and precisely before the man of the great current hestands all the colder and more reserved--his eye is then like a smoothand irresponsive lake which is no longer moved by rapture or sympathy.the worst and most dangerous thing of which a scholar is capable resultsfrom the instinct of mediocrity of his type from the jesuitism ofmediocrity which labours instinctively for the destruction ofthe exceptional man and endeavours to break--or still better torelax--every bent bow to relax of course with consideration andnaturally with an indulgent hand--to relax with confiding sympathythat is the real art of jesuitism which has always understood how tointroduce itself as the religion of sympathy.. however gratefully one may welcome the objective spirit--andwho has not been sick to death of all subjectivity and its confoundedipsisimosity!--in the end however one must learn caution even withregard to ones gratitude and put a stop to the exaggeration withwhich the unselfing and depersonalizing of the spirit has recently beencelebrated as if it were the goal in itself as if it were salvationand glorification--as is especially accustomed to happen in thepessimist school which has also in its turn good reasons for paying thehighest honours to disinterested knowledge the objective man who nolonger curses and scolds like the pessimist the ideal man of learningin whom the scientific instinct blossoms forth fully after a thousandcomplete and partial failures is assuredly one of the most costlyinstruments that exist but his place is in the hand of one who is morepowerful he is only an instrument we may say he is a mirror--he is nopurpose in himself the objective man is in truth a mirror accustomedto prostration before everything that wants to be known with suchdesires only as knowing or reflecting implies--he waits untilsomething comes and then expands himself sensitively so that even thelight footsteps and gliding-past of spiritual beings may not be lost onhis surface and film whatever personality he still possesses seems tohim accidental arbitrary or still oftener disturbing so much has hecome to regard himself as the passage and reflection of outside formsand events he calls up the recollection of himself with an effortand not infrequently wrongly he readily confounds himself with otherpersons he makes mistakes with regard to his own needs and here onlyis he unrefined and negligent perhaps he is troubled about the healthor the pettiness and confined atmosphere of wife and friend or the lackof companions and society--indeed he sets himself to reflect on hissuffering but in vain! his thoughts already rove away to the moregeneral case and tomorrow he knows as little as he knew yesterday howto help himself he does not now take himself seriously and devote timeto himself he is serene not from lack of trouble but from lackof capacity for grasping and dealing with his trouble the habitualcomplaisance with respect to all objects and experiences the radiantand impartial hospitality with which he receives everything thatcomes his way his habit of inconsiderate good-nature of dangerousindifference as to yea and nay: alas! there are enough of cases in whichhe has to atone for these virtues of his!--and as man generally hebecomes far too easily the caput mortuum of such virtues. should onewish love or hatred from him--i mean love and hatred as god woman andanimal understand them--he will do what he can and furnish what he can.but one must not be surprised if it should not be much--if he shouldshow himself just at this point to be false fragile questionable anddeteriorated. his love is constrained his hatred is artificial andrather un tour de force a slight ostentation and exaggeration. he isonly genuine so far as he can be objective; only in his serene totalityis he still nature and natural. his mirroring and eternallyself-polishing soul no longer knows how to affirm no longer how todeny; he does not command; neither does he destroy. je ne meprisepresque rien--he says with leibniz: let us not overlook nor undervaluethe presque! neither is he a model man; he does not go in advance of anyone nor after either; he places himself generally too far off to haveany reason for espousing the cause of either good or evil. if he hasbeen so long confounded with the philosopher with the caesarian trainerand dictator of civilization he has had far too much honour and whatis more essential in him has been overlooked--he is an instrumentsomething of a slave though certainly the sublimest sort of slave butnothing in himself--presque rien! the objective man is an instrumenta costly easily injured easily tarnished measuring instrument andmirroring apparatus which is to be taken care of and respected; but heis no goal not outgoing nor upgoing no complementary man in whom therest of existence justifies itself no termination--and still less acommencement an engendering or primary cause nothing hardy powerfulself-centred that wants to be master; but rather only a soft inflateddelicate movable potters-form that must wait for some kind of contentand frame to shape itself thereto--for the most part a man withoutframe and content a selfless man. consequently also nothing forwomen in parenthesi.. when a philosopher nowadays makes known that he is not a skeptic--ihope that has been gathered from the foregoing description of theobjective spirit--people all hear it impatiently; they regard him onthat account with some apprehension they would like to ask so manymany questions... indeed among timid hearers of whom there are now somany he is henceforth said to be dangerous. with his repudiation ofskepticism it seems to them as if they heard some evil-threateningsound in the distance as if a new kind of explosive were being triedsomewhere a dynamite of the spirit perhaps a newly discovered russiannihiline a pessimism bonae voluntatis that not only denies meansdenial but--dreadful thought! practises denial. against this kind ofgood-will--a will to the veritable actual negation of life--there isas is generally acknowledged nowadays no better soporific and sedativethan skepticism the mild pleasing lulling poppy of skepticism;and hamlet himself is now prescribed by the doctors of the day as anantidote to the spirit and its underground noises. are not our earsalready full of bad sounds say the skeptics as lovers of repose andalmost as a kind of safety police; this subterranean nay is terrible!be still ye pessimistic moles! the skeptic in effect that delicatecreature is far too easily frightened; his conscience is schooled soas to start at every nay and even at that sharp decided yea and feelssomething like a bite thereby. yea! and nay!--they seem to him opposedto morality; he loves on the contrary to make a festival to his virtueby a noble aloofness while perhaps he says with montaigne: what do iknow or with socrates: i know that i know nothing. or: here i donot trust myself no door is open to me. or: even if the door wereopen why should i enter immediately or: what is the use of any hastyhypotheses it might quite well be in good taste to make no hypothesesat all. are you absolutely obliged to straighten at once what iscrooked to stuff every hole with some kind of oakum is there not timeenough for that has not the time leisure oh ye demons can ye notat all wait the uncertain also has its charms the sphinx too is acirce and circe too was a philosopher.--thus does a skeptic consolehimself; and in truth he needs some consolation. for skepticism isthe most spiritual expression of a certain many-sided physiologicaltemperament which in ordinary language is called nervous debility andsickliness; it arises whenever races or classes which have been longseparated decisively and suddenly blend with one another. in the newgeneration which has inherited as it were different standards andvaluations in its blood everything is disquiet derangement doubt andtentativeness; the best powers operate restrictively the very virtuesprevent each other growing and becoming strong equilibrium ballastand perpendicular stability are lacking in body and soul. that howeverwhich is most diseased and degenerated in such nondescripts is thewill; they are no longer familiar with independence of decision orthe courageous feeling of pleasure in willing--they are doubtful of thefreedom of the will even in their dreams our present-day europethe scene of a senseless precipitate attempt at a radical blending ofclasses and consequently of races is therefore skeptical in all itsheights and depths sometimes exhibiting the mobile skepticism whichsprings impatiently and wantonly from branch to branch sometimes withgloomy aspect like a cloud over-charged with interrogative signs--andoften sick unto death of its will! paralysis of will where do we notfind this cripple sitting nowadays! and yet how bedecked oftentimes howseductively ornamented! there are the finest gala dresses and disguisesfor this disease and that for instance most of what places itselfnowadays in the show-cases as objectiveness the scientific spiritlart pour lart and pure voluntary knowledge is only decked-outskepticism and paralysis of will--i am ready to answer for thisdiagnosis of the european disease--the disease of the will is diffusedunequally over europe it is worst and most varied where civilizationhas longest prevailed it decreases according as the barbarianstill--or again--asserts his claims under the loose drapery of westernculture it is therefore in the france of today as can be readilydisclosed and comprehended that the will is most infirm and francewhich has always had a masterly aptitude for converting even theportentous crises of its spirit into something charming and seductivenow manifests emphatically its intellectual ascendancy over europeby being the school and exhibition of all the charms of skepticism thepower to will and to persist moreover in a resolution is alreadysomewhat stronger in germany and again in the north of

their pet phrase from ourphysicists perhaps not only indian wars and complications in asia wouldbe necessary to free europe from its greatest danger but also internalsubversion the shattering of the empire into small states and aboveall the introduction of parliamentary imbecility together with theobligation of every one to read his newspaper at breakfast i do notsay this as one who desires it in my heart i should rather prefer thecontrary--i mean such an increase in the threatening attitude ofrussia that europe would have to make up its mind to become equallythreatening--namely to acquire one will by means of a new caste torule over the continent a persistent dreadful will of its own thatcan set its aims thousands of years ahead; so that the long spun-outcomedy of its petty-statism and its dynastic as well as its democraticmany-willed-ness might finally be brought to a close. the time forpetty politics is past; the next century will bring the struggle for thedominion of the world--the compulsion to great politics.. as to how far the new warlike age on which we europeans haveevidently entered may perhaps favour the growth of another and strongerkind of skepticism i should like to express myself preliminarilymerely by a parable which the lovers of german history will alreadyunderstand. that unscrupulous enthusiast for big handsome grenadierswho as king of prussia brought into being a military and skepticalgenius--and therewith in reality the new and now triumphantly emergedtype of german the problematic crazy father of frederick the greathad on one point the very knack and lucky grasp of the genius: he knewwhat was then lacking in germany the want of which was a hundred timesmore alarming and serious than any lack of culture and social form--hisill-will to the young frederick resulted from the anxiety of a profoundinstinct. men were lacking; and he suspected to his bitterest regretthat his own son was not man enough. there however he deceivedhimself; but who would not have deceived himself in his place he sawhis son lapsed to atheism to the esprit to the pleasant frivolity ofclever frenchmen--he saw in the background the great bloodsucker thespider skepticism; he suspected the incurable wretchedness of a heart nolonger hard enough either for evil or good and of a broken will that nolonger commands is no longer able to command. meanwhile howeverthere grew up in his son that new kind of harder and more dangerousskepticism--who knows to what extent it was encouraged just byhis fathers hatred and the icy melancholy of a will condemned tosolitude--the skepticism of daring manliness which is closely relatedto the genius for war and conquest and made its first entrance intogermany in the person of the great frederick. this skepticism despisesand nevertheless grasps; it undermines and takes possession; it doesnot believe but it does not thereby lose itself; it gives the spirit adangerous liberty but it keeps strict guard over the heart. it is thegerman form of skepticism which as a continued fredericianism risento the highest spirituality has kept europe for a considerable timeunder the dominion of the german spirit and its critical and historicaldistrust owing to the insuperably strong and tough masculine characterof the great german philologists and historical critics whorightly estimated were also all of them artists of destructionand dissolution a new conception of the german spirit graduallyestablished itself--in spite of all romanticism in music andphilosophy--in which the leaning towards masculine skepticism wasdecidedly prominent whether for instance as fearlessness of gaze ascourage and sternness of the dissecting hand or as resolute will todangerous voyages of discovery to spiritualized north pole expeditionsunder barren and dangerous skies. there may be good grounds for it whenwarm-blooded and superficial humanitarians cross themselves before thisspirit cet esprit fataliste ironique mephistophelique as micheletcalls it not without a shudder. but if one would realize howcharacteristic is this fear of the man in the german spirit whichawakened europe out of its dogmatic slumber let us call to mind theformer conception which had to be overcome by this new one--and thatit is not so very long ago that a masculinized woman could dare withunbridled presumption to recommend the germans to the interest ofeurope as gentle good-hearted weak-willed and poetical fools.finally let us only understand profoundly enough napoleonsastonishment when he saw goethe it reveals what had been regarded forcenturies as the german spirit voila un homme!--that was as much asto say but this is a man! and i only expected to see a german!. supposing then that in the picture of the philosophers of thefuture some trait suggests the question whether they must not perhapsbe skeptics in the last-mentioned sense something in them would only bedesignated thereby--and not they themselves. with equal right they mightcall themselves critics and assuredly they will be men of experiments.by the name with which i ventured to baptize them i have alreadyexpressly emphasized their attempting and their love of attempting isthis because as critics in body and soul they will love to make useof experiments in a new and perhaps wider and more dangerous sense intheir passion for knowledge will they have to go further in daring andpainful attempts than the sensitive and pampered taste of a democraticcentury can approve of--there is no doubt these coming ones will beleast able to dispense with the serious and not unscrupulous qualitieswhich distinguish the critic from the skeptic i mean the certainty as tostandards of worth the conscious employment of a unity of methodthe wary courage the standing-alone and the capacity forself-responsibility indeed they will avow among themselves a delightin denial and dissection and a certain considerate cruelty which knowshow to handle the knife surely and deftly even when the heart bleedsthey will be sterner and perhaps not always towards themselves onlythan humane people may desire they will not deal with the truth inorder that it may please them or elevate and inspire them--theywill rather have little faith in truth bringing with it such revelsfor the feelings. they will smile those rigorous spirits when any onesays in their presence that thought elevates me why should it not betrue or that work enchants me why should it not be beautiful orthat artist enlarges me why should he not be great perhaps theywill not only have a smile but a genuine disgust for all that is thusrapturous idealistic feminine and hermaphroditic and if any onecould look into their inmost hearts he would not easily find thereinthe intention to reconcile christian sentiments with antique tasteor even with modern parliamentarism the kind of reconciliationnecessarily found even among philosophers in our very uncertain andconsequently very conciliatory century. critical discipline and everyhabit that conduces to purity and rigour in intellectual matterswill not only be demanded from themselves by these philosophers ofthe future they may even make a display thereof as their specialadornment--nevertheless they will not want to be called critics on thataccount. it will seem to them no small indignity to philosophy tohave it decreed as is so welcome nowadays that philosophy itself iscriticism and critical science--and nothing else whatever! though thisestimate of philosophy may enjoy the approval of all the positivists offrance and germany and possibly it even flattered the heart and tasteof kant: let us call to mind the titles of his principal works our newphilosophers will say notwithstanding that critics are instruments ofthe philosopher and just on that account as instruments they arefar from being philosophers themselves! even the great chinaman ofkonigsberg was only a great critic.. i insist upon it that people finally cease confoundingphilosophical workers and in general scientific men withphilosophers--that precisely here one should strictly give each hisown and not give those far too much these far too little. it maybe necessary for the education of the real philosopher that he himselfshould have once stood upon all those steps upon which his servantsthe scientific workers of philosophy remain standing and must remainstanding he himself must perhaps have been critic and dogmatistand historian and besides poet and collector and traveler andriddle-reader and moralist and seer and free spirit and almosteverything in order to traverse the whole range of human valuesand estimations and that he may be able with a variety of eyes andconsciences to look from a height to any distance from a depth upto any height from a nook into any expanse. but all these are onlypreliminary conditions for his task; this task itself demands somethingelse--it requires him to create values. the philosophical workers afterthe excellent pattern of kant and hegel have to fix and formalize somegreat existing body of valuations--that is to say former determinationsof value creations of value which have become prevalent and are fora time called truths--whether in the domain of the logical thepolitical moral or the artistic. it is for these investigators tomake whatever has happened and been esteemed hitherto conspicuousconceivable intelligible and manageable to shorten everything longeven time itself and to subjugate the entire past: an immense andwonderful task in the carrying out of which all refined pride alltenacious will can surely find satisfaction. the real philosophershowever are commanders and law-givers; they say: thus shall it be!they determine first the whither and the why of mankind and therebyset aside the previous labour of all philosophical workers and allsubjugators of the past--they grasp at the future with a creativehand and whatever is and was becomes for them thereby a means aninstrument and a hammer. their knowing is creating their creatingis a law-giving their will to truth is--will to power.--are there atpresent such philosophers have there ever been such philosophers mustthere not be such philosophers some day .... it is always more obvious to me that the philosopher as a manindispensable for the morrow and the day after the morrow has everfound himself and has been obliged to find himself in contradictionto the day in which he lives; his enemy has always been the ideal of hisday. hitherto all those extraordinary furtherers of humanity whom onecalls philosophers--who rarely regarded themselves as lovers of wisdombut rather as disagreeable fools and dangerous interrogators--have foundtheir mission their hard involuntary imperative mission in the endhowever the greatness of their mission in being the bad conscience oftheir age. in putting the vivisectors knife to the breast of the veryvirtues of their age they have betrayed their own secret; it has beenfor the sake of a new greatness of man a new untrodden path tohis aggrandizement. they have always disclosed how much hypocrisyindolence self-indulgence and self-neglect how much falsehood wasconcealed under the most venerated types of contemporary morality howmuch virtue was outlived they have always said we must remove hence towhere you are least at home in the face of a world of modern ideaswhich would like to confine every one in a corner in a specialty aphilosopher if there could be philosophers nowadays would be compelledto place the greatness of man the conception of greatness preciselyin his comprehensiveness and multifariousness in his all-roundness hewould even determine worth and rank according to the amount and varietyof that which a man could bear and take upon himself according to theextent to which a man could stretch his responsibility nowadays thetaste and virtue of the age weaken and attenuate the will nothing isso adapted to the spirit of the age as weakness of will consequently inthe ideal of the philosopher strength of will sternness and capacityfor prolonged resolution must specially be included in the conceptionof greatness with as good a right as the opposite doctrine with itsideal of a silly renouncing humble selfless humanity was suited toan opposite age--such as the sixteenth century which suffered from itsaccumulated energy of will and from the wildest torrents and floodsof selfishness in the time of socrates among men only of worn-outinstincts old conservative athenians who let themselves go--for thesake of happiness as they said for the sake of pleasure as theirconduct indicated--and who had continually on their lips the old pompouswords to which they had long forfeited the right by the life they ledirony was perhaps necessary for greatness of soul the wicked socraticassurance of the old physician and plebeian who cut ruthlessly into hisown flesh as into the flesh and heart of the noble with a look thatsaid plainly enough do not dissemble before me! here--we are equal!at present on the contrary when throughout europe the herding-animalalone attains to honours and dispenses honours when equality ofright can too readily be transformed into equality in wrong--i mean tosay into general war against everything rare strange and privilegedagainst the higher man the higher soul the higher duty the higherresponsibility the creative plenipotence and lordliness--at presentit belongs to the conception of greatness to be noble to wish to beapart to be capable of being different to stand alone to have to liveby personal initiative and the philosopher will betray something of hisown ideal when he asserts he shall be the greatest who can be the mostsolitary the most concealed the most divergent the man beyond goodand evil the master of his virtues and of super-abundance of will;precisely this shall be called greatness: as diversified as can beentire as ample as can be full. and to ask once more the question: isgreatness possible--nowadays. it is difficult to learn what a philosopher is because it cannotbe taught: one must know it by experience--or one should have thepride not to know it. the fact that at present people all talk of thingsof which they cannot have any experience is true more especiallyand unfortunately as concerns the philosopher and philosophicalmatters:--the very few know them are permitted to know them andall popular ideas about them are false. thus for instance the trulyphilosophical combination of a bold exuberant spirituality which runsat presto pace and a dialectic rigour and necessity which makes nofalse step is unknown to most thinkers and scholars from their ownexperience and therefore should any one speak of it in theirpresence it is incredible to them. they conceive of every necessity astroublesome as a painful compulsory obedience and state of constraint;thinking itself is regarded by them as something slow and hesitatingalmost as a trouble and often enough as worthy of the sweat of thenoble--but not at all as something easy and divine closely relatedto dancing and exuberance! to think and to take a matter seriouslyarduously--that is one and the same thing to them; such only has beentheir experience.--artists have here perhaps a finer intuition; theywho know only too well that precisely when they no longer do anythingarbitrarily and everything of necessity their feeling of freedomof subtlety of power of creatively fixing disposing and shapingreaches its climax--in short that necessity and freedom of will arethen the same thing with them. there is in fine a gradation of rankin psychical states to which the gradation of rank in the problemscorresponds; and the highest problems repel ruthlessly every one whoventures too near them without being predestined for their solutionby the loftiness and power of his spirituality. of what use is it fornimble everyday intellects or clumsy honest mechanics and empiriciststo press in their plebeian ambition close to such problems and asit were into this holy of holies--as so often happens nowadays! butcoarse feet must never tread upon such carpets: this is provided for inthe primary law of things; the doors remain closed to those intrudersthough they may dash and break their heads thereon. people have alwaysto be born to a high station or more definitely they have to be bredfor it: a person has only a right to philosophy--taking the word inits higher significance--in virtue of his descent; the ancestors theblood decide here also. many generations must have prepared the wayfor the coming of the philosopher; each of his virtues must have beenseparately acquired nurtured transmitted and embodied; not only thebold easy delicate course and current of his thoughts but above allthe readiness for great responsibilities the majesty of ruling glanceand contemning look the feeling of separation from the multitude withtheir duties and virtues the kindly patronage and defense of whateveris misunderstood and calumniated be it god or devil the delight andpractice of supreme justice the art of commanding the amplitude ofwill the lingering eye which rarely admires rarely looks up rarelyloves....chapter vii. our virtues. our virtues--it is probable that we too have still our virtuesalthough naturally they are not those sincere and massive virtues onaccount of which we hold our grandfathers in esteem and also at a littledistance from us. we europeans of the day after tomorrow we firstlingsof the twentieth century--with all our dangerous curiosity ourmultifariousness and art of disguising our mellow and seeminglysweetened cruelty in sense and spirit--we shall presumably if we musthave virtues have those only which have come to agreement with our mostsecret and heartfelt inclinations with our most ardent requirements:well then let us look for them in our labyrinths!--where as we knowso many things lose themselves so many things get quite lost! and isthere anything finer than to search for ones own virtues is it notalmost to believe in ones own virtues but this believing in onesown virtues--is it not practically the same as what was formerly calledones good conscience that long respectable pigtail of an ideawhich our grandfathers used to hang behind their heads and often enoughalso behind their understandings it seems therefore that howeverlittle we may imagine ourselves to be old-fashioned and grandfatherlyrespectable in other respects in one thing we are nevertheless theworthy grandchildren of our grandfathers we last europeans with goodconsciences: we also still wear their pigtail.--ah! if you only knew howsoon so very soon--it will be different!. as in the stellar firmament there are sometimes two suns whichdetermine the path of one planet and in certain cases suns of differentcolours shine around a single planet now with red light now withgreen and then simultaneously illumine and flood it with motleycolours: so we modern men owing to the complicated mechanism of ourfirmament are determined by different moralities; our actions shinealternately in different colours and are seldom unequivocal--and thereare often cases also in which our actions are motley-coloured.. to love ones enemies i think that has been well learnt: it takesplace thousands of times at present on a large and small scale; indeedat times the higher and sublimer thing takes place:--we learn to despisewhen we love and precisely when we love best; all of it howeverunconsciously without noise without ostentation with the shame andsecrecy of goodness which forbids the utterance of the pompous wordand the formula of virtue. morality as attitude--is opposed to our tastenowadays. this is also an advance as it was an advance in our fathersthat religion as an attitude finally became opposed to their tasteincluding the enmity and voltairean bitterness against religion and allthat formerly belonged to freethinker-pantomime. it is the music in ourconscience the dance in our spirit to which puritan litanies moralsermons and goody-goodness wont chime.. let us be careful in dealing with those who attach great importanceto being credited with moral tact and subtlety in moral discernment!they never forgive us if they have once made a mistake before usor even with regard to us--they inevitably become our instinctivecalumniators and detractors even when they still remain ourfriends.--blessed are the forgetful: for they get the better even oftheir blunders.. the psychologists of france--and where else are there stillpsychologists nowadays--have never yet exhausted their bitter andmanifold enjoyment of the betise bourgeoise just as though... inshort they betray something thereby. flaubert for instance the honestcitizen of rouen neither saw heard nor tasted anything else in theend; it was his mode of self-torment and refined cruelty. as this isgrowing wearisome i would now recommend for a change something elsefor a pleasure--namely the unconscious astuteness with which good fathonest mediocrity always behaves towards loftier spirits and the tasksthey have to perform the subtle barbed jesuitical astuteness whichis a thousand times subtler than the taste and understanding of themiddle-class in its best moments--subtler even than the understanding ofits victims:--a repeated proof that instinct is the most intelligentof all kinds of intelligence which have hitherto been discovered. inshort you psychologists study the philosophy of the rule in itsstruggle with the exception: there you have a spectacle fit for godsand godlike malignity! or in plainer words practise vivisection ongood people on the homo bonae voluntatis on yourselves!. the practice of judging and condemning morally is the favouriterevenge of the intellectually shallow on those who are less so it isalso a kind of indemnity for their being badly endowed by natureand finally it is an opportunity for acquiring spirit and becomingsubtle--malice spiritualises. they are glad in their inmost heart thatthere is a standard according to which those who are over-endowed withintellectual goods and privileges are equal to them they contend forthe equality of all before god and almost need the belief in god forthis purpose. it is among them that the most powerful antagonists ofatheism are found. if any one were to say to them a lofty spiritualityis beyond all comparison with the honesty and respectability of a merelymoral man--it would make them furious i shall take care not to sayso. i would rather flatter them with my theory that lofty spiritualityitself exists only as the ultimate product of moral qualities that itis a synthesis of all qualities attributed to the merely moral manafter they have been acquired singly through long training and practiceperhaps during a whole series of generations that lofty spiritualityis precisely the spiritualising of justice and the beneficent severitywhich knows that it is authorized to maintain gradations of rank in theworld even among things--and not only among men.. now that the praise of the disinterested person is so popularone must--probably not without some danger--get an idea of what peopleactually take an interest in and what are the things generally whichfundamentally and profoundly concern ordinary men--including thecultured even the learned and perhaps philosophers also ifappearances do not deceive. the fact thereby becomes obvious that thegreater part of what interests and charms higher natures and morerefined and fastidious tastes seems absolutely uninteresting tothe average man--if notwithstanding he perceive devotion to theseinterests he calls it desinteresse and wonders how it is possible toact disinterestedly. there have been philosophers who could give thispopular astonishment a seductive and mystical other-worldly expressionperhaps because they did not know the higher nature by experienceinstead of stating the naked and candidly reasonable truth thatdisinterested action is very interesting and interested actionprovided that... and love--what! even an action for loves sakeshall be unegoistic but you fools--! and the praise of theself-sacrificer--but whoever has really offered sacrifice knows thathe wanted and obtained something for it--perhaps something from himselffor something from himself; that he relinquished here in order to havemore there perhaps in general to be more or even feel himself more.but this is a realm of questions and answers in which a more fastidiousspirit does not like to stay: for here truth has to stifle her yawns somuch when she is obliged to answer. and after all truth is a woman; onemust not use force with her.. it sometimes happens said a moralistic pedant andtrifle-retailer that i honour and respect an unselfish man: nothowever because he is unselfish but because i think he has a right tobe useful to another man at his own expense. in short the questionis always who he is and who the other is. for instance in a personcreated and destined for command self-denial and modest retirementinstead of being virtues would be the waste of virtues: so it seemsto me. every system of unegoistic morality which takes itselfunconditionally and appeals to every one not only sins against goodtaste but is also an incentive to sins of omission an additionalseduction under the mask of philanthropy--and precisely a seduction andinjury to the higher rarer and more privileged types of men. moralsystems must be compelled first of all to bow before the gradations ofrank; their presumption must be driven home to their conscience--untilthey thoroughly understand at last that it is immoral to say that whatis right for one is proper for another.--so said my moralistic pedantand bonhomme. did he perhaps deserve to be laughed at when he thusexhorted systems of morals to practise morality but one should not betoo much in the right if one wishes to have the laughers on ones ownside; a grain of wrong pertains even to good taste.. wherever sympathy fellow-suffering is preached nowadays--andif i gather rightly no other religion is any longer preached--let thepsychologist have his ears open through all the vanity through all thenoise which is natural to these preachers as to all preachers he willhear a hoarse groaning genuine note of self-contempt. it belongsto the overshadowing and uglifying of europe which has been onthe increase for a century the first symptoms of which are alreadyspecified documentarily in a thoughtful letter of galiani to madamedepinay--if it is not really the cause thereof! the man ofmodern ideas the conceited ape is excessively dissatisfied withhimself--this is perfectly certain. he suffers and his vanity wants himonly to suffer with his fellows.. the hybrid european--a tolerably ugly plebeian taken all inall--absolutely requires a costume: he needs history as a storeroomof costumes. to be sure he notices that none of the costumes fit himproperly--he changes and changes. let us look at the nineteenth centurywith respect to these hasty preferences and changes in its masqueradesof style and also with respect to its moments of desperation on accountof nothing suiting us. it is in vain to get ourselves up as romanticor classical or christian or florentine or barocco or nationalin moribus et artibus: it does not clothe us! but the spiritespecially the historical spirit profits even by this desperation:once and again a new sample of the past or of the foreign is testedput on taken off packed up and above all studied--we are the firststudious age in puncto of costumes i mean as concerns moralsarticles of belief artistic tastes and religions; we are prepared asno other age has ever been for a carnival in the grand style for themost spiritual festival--laughter and arrogance for the transcendentalheight of supreme folly and aristophanic ridicule of the world. perhapswe are still discovering the domain of our invention just here thedomain where even we can still be original probably as parodists ofthe worlds history and as gods merry-andrews--perhaps though nothingelse of the present have a future our laughter itself may have afuture!. the historical sense or the capacity for divining quicklythe order of rank of the valuations according to which a people acommunity or an individual has lived the divining instinct for therelationships of these valuations for the relation of the authorityof the valuations to the authority of the operating forces--thishistorical sense which we europeans claim as our specialty has cometo us in the train of the enchanting and mad semi-barbarity into whicheurope has been plunged by the democratic mingling of classes andraces--it is only the nineteenth century that has recognized thisfaculty as its sixth sense. owing to this mingling the past of everyform and mode of life and of cultures which were formerly closelycontiguous and superimposed on one another flows forth into us modernsouls; our instincts now run back in all directions we ourselves area kind of chaos: in the end as we have said the spirit perceives itsadvantage therein. by means of our semi-barbarity in body and in desirewe have secret access everywhere such as a noble age never had; we haveaccess above all to the labyrinth of imperfect civilizations and toevery form of semi-barbarity that has at any time existed on earth; andin so far as the most considerable part of human civilization hithertohas just been semi-barbarity the historical sense implies almost thesense and instinct for everything the taste and tongue for everything:whereby it immediately proves itself to be an ignoble sense. forinstance we enjoy homer once more: it is perhaps our happiestacquisition that we know how to appreciate homer whom men ofdistinguished culture as the french of the seventeenth century likesaint-evremond who reproached him for his esprit vaste and evenvoltaire the last echo of the century cannot and could not so easilyappropriate--whom they scarcely permitted themselves to enjoy. the verydecided yea and nay of their palate their promptly ready disgust theirhesitating reluctance with regard to everything strange their horror ofthe bad taste even of lively curiosity and in general the averseness ofevery distinguished and self-sufficing culture to avow a new desirea dissatisfaction with its own condition or an admiration of what isstrange: all this determines and disposes them unfavourably even towardsthe best things of the world which are not their property or could notbecome their prey--and no faculty is more unintelligible to such menthan just this historical sense with its truckling plebeiancuriosity. the case is not different with shakespeare that marvelousspanish-moorish-saxon synthesis of taste over whom an ancient athenianof the circle of aeschylus would have half-killed himself with laughteror irritation: but we--accept precisely this wild motleyness thismedley of the most delicate the most coarse and the most artificialwith a secret confidence and cordiality; we enjoy it as a refinementof art reserved expressly for us and allow ourselves to be as littledisturbed by the repulsive fumes and the proximity of the englishpopulace in which shakespeares art and taste lives as perhaps onthe chiaja of naples where with all our senses awake we go our wayenchanted and voluntarily in spite of the drain-odour of the lowerquarters of the town. that as men of the historical sense we haveour virtues is not to be disputed:--we are unpretentious unselfishmodest brave habituated to self-control and self-renunciation verygrateful very patient very complaisant--but with all this we areperhaps not very tasteful. let us finally confess it that what ismost difficult for us men of the historical sense to grasp feeltaste and love what finds us fundamentally prejudiced and almosthostile is precisely the perfection and ultimate maturity in everyculture and art the essentially noble in works and men their momentof smooth sea and halcyon self-sufficiency the goldenness and coldnesswhich all things show that have perfected themselves. perhaps our greatvirtue of the historical sense is in necessary contrast to good tasteat least to the very bad taste; and we can only evoke in ourselvesimperfectly hesitatingly and with compulsion the small short andhappy godsends and glorifications of human life as they shine here andthere: those moments and marvelous experiences when a great power hasvoluntarily come to a halt before the boundless and infinite--when asuper-abundance of refined delight has been enjoyed by a sudden checkingand petrifying by standing firmly and planting oneself fixedly on stilltrembling ground. proportionateness is strange to us let us confess itto ourselves; our itching is really the itching for the infinite theimmeasurable. like the rider on his forward panting horse we let thereins fall before the infinite we modern men we semi-barbarians--andare only in our highest bliss when we--are in most danger.. whether it be hedonism pessimism utilitarianism or eudaemonismall those modes of thinking which measure the worth of things accordingto pleasure and pain that is according to accompanying circumstancesand secondary considerations are plausible modes of thought andnaivetes which every one conscious of creative powers and an artistsconscience will look down upon with scorn though not without sympathy.sympathy for you!--to be sure that is not sympathy as you understandit: it is not sympathy for social distress for society with itssick and misfortuned for the hereditarily vicious and defective who lieon the ground around us; still less is it sympathy for the grumblingvexed revolutionary slave-classes who strive after power--they call itfreedom. our sympathy is a loftier and further-sighted sympathy:--wesee how man dwarfs himself how you dwarf him! and there are momentswhen we view your sympathy with an indescribable anguish when we resistit--when we regard your seriousness as more dangerous than any kindof levity. you want if possible--and there is not a more foolish ifpossible--to do away with suffering; and we--it really seems that wewould rather have it increased and made worse than it has ever been!well-being as you understand it--is certainly not a goal; it seemsto us an end; a condition which at once renders man ludicrous andcontemptible--and makes his destruction desirable! the disciplineof suffering of great suffering--know ye not that it is only thisdiscipline that has produced all the elevations of humanity hithertothe tension of soul in misfortune which communicates to it its energyits shuddering in view of rack and ruin its inventiveness and braveryin undergoing enduring interpreting and exploiting misfortune andwhatever depth mystery disguise spirit artifice or greatness hasbeen bestowed upon the soul--has it not been bestowed through sufferingthrough the discipline of great suffering in man creature and creatorare united: in man there is not only matter shred excess clay mirefolly chaos; but there is also the creator the sculptor the hardnessof the hammer the divinity of the spectator and the seventh day--doye understand this contrast and that your sympathy for the creaturein man applies to that which has to be fashioned bruised forgedstretched roasted annealed refined--to that which must necessarilysuffer and is meant to suffer and our sympathy--do ye not understandwhat our reverse sympathy applies to when it resists your sympathy asthe worst of all pampering and enervation--so it is sympathy againstsympathy!--but to repeat it once more there are higher problems thanthe problems of pleasure and pain and sympathy; and all systems ofphilosophy which deal only with these are naivetes.. we immoralists.--this world with which we are concerned in whichwe have to fear and love this almost invisible inaudible world ofdelicate command and delicate obedience a world of almost in everyrespect captious insidious sharp and tender--yes it is wellprotected from clumsy spectators and familiar curiosity! we arewoven into a strong net and garment of duties and cannot disengageourselves--precisely here we are men of duty even we! occasionallyit is true we dance in our chains and betwixt our swords; itis none the less true that more often we gnash our teeth under thecircumstances and are impatient at the secret hardship of our lot. butdo what we will fools and appearances say of us: these are men withoutduty--we have always fools and appearances against us!. honesty granting that it is the virtue of which we cannot ridourselves we free spirits--well we will labour at it with all ourperversity and love and not tire of perfecting ourselves in ourvirtue which alone remains: may its glance some day overspread likea gilded blue mocking twilight this aging civilization with its dullgloomy seriousness! and if nevertheless our honesty should one daygrow weary and sigh and stretch its limbs and find us too hard andwould fain have it pleasanter easier and gentler like an agreeablevice let us remain hard we latest stoics and let us send to itshelp whatever devilry we have in us:--our disgust at the clumsyand undefined our nitimur in vetitum our love of adventureour sharpened and fastidious curiosity our most subtle disguisedintellectual will to power and universal conquest which rambles androves avidiously around all the realms of the future--let us go with allour devils to the help of our god! it is probable that people willmisunderstand and mistake us on that account: what does it matter! theywill say: their honesty--that is their devilry and nothing else!what does it matter! and even if they were right--have not all godshitherto been such sanctified re-baptized devils and after all whatdo we know of ourselves and what the spirit that leads us wants to becalled it is a question of names. and how many spirits we harbourour honesty we free spirits--let us be careful lest it become ourvanity our ornament and ostentation our limitation our stupidity!every virtue inclines to stupidity every stupidity to virtue; stupidto the point of sanctity they say in russia--let us be careful lestout of pure honesty we eventually become saints and bores! is not lifea hundred times too short for us--to bore ourselves one would have tobelieve in eternal life in order to.... i hope to be forgiven for discovering that all moral philosophyhitherto has been tedious and has belonged to the soporificappliances--and that virtue in my opinion has been more injuredby the tediousness of its advocates than by anything else; at the sametime however i would not wish to overlook their general usefulness. itis desirable that as few people as possible should reflect upon moralsand consequently it is very desirable that morals should not some daybecome interesting! but let us not be afraid! things still remain todayas they have always been: i see no one in europe who has or disclosesan idea of the fact that philosophizing concerning morals might beconducted in a dangerous captious and ensnaring manner--that calamitymight be involved therein. observe for example the indefatigableinevitable english utilitarians: how ponderously and respectably theystalk on stalk along a homeric metaphor expresses it better in thefootsteps of bentham just as he had already stalked in the footsteps ofthe respectable helvetius! no he was not a dangerous man helvetiusce senateur pococurante to use an expression of galiani. no newthought nothing of the nature of a finer turning or better expressionof an old thought not even a proper history of what has been previouslythought on the subject: an impossible literature taking it all in allunless one knows how to leaven it with some mischief. in effect theold english vice called cant which is moral tartuffism has insinuateditself also into these moralists whom one must certainly read with aneye to their motives if one must read them concealed this time underthe new form of the scientific spirit; moreover there is not absentfrom them a secret struggle with the pangs of conscience from which arace of former puritans must naturally suffer in all their scientifictinkering with morals. is not a moralist the opposite of a puritanthat is to say as a thinker who regards morality as questionableas worthy of interrogation in short as a problem is moralizingnot-immoral in the end they all want english morality to berecognized as authoritative inasmuch as mankind or the generalutility or the happiness of the greatest number--no! the happinessof england will be best served thereby. they would like by all meansto convince themselves that the striving after english happiness imean after comfort and fashion and in the highest instance a seat inparliament is at the same time the true path of virtue; in fact thatin so far as there has been virtue in the world hitherto it hasjust consisted in such striving. not one of those ponderousconscience-stricken herding-animals who undertake to advocate thecause of egoism as conducive to the general welfare wants to haveany knowledge or inkling of the facts that the general welfare isno ideal no goal no notion that can be at all grasped but is only anostrum--that what is fair to one may not at all be fair to anotherthat the requirement of one morality for all is really a detriment tohigher men in short that there is a distinction of rank between manand man and consequently between morality and morality. they are anunassuming and fundamentally mediocre species of men these utilitarianenglishmen and as already remarked in so far as they are tedious onecannot think highly enough of their utility. one ought even to encouragethem as has been partially attempted in the following rhymes:--    hail ye worthies barrow-wheeling    longer--better aye revealing    stiffer aye in head and knee;    unenraptured never jesting    mediocre everlasting    sans genie et sans esprit!. in these later ages which may be proud of their humanity therestill remains so much fear so much superstition of the fear of thecruel wild beast the mastering of which constitutes the very pride ofthese humaner ages--that even obvious truths as if by the agreementof centuries have long remained unuttered because they have theappearance of helping the finally slain wild beast back to life again.i perhaps risk something when i allow such a truth to escape; letothers capture it again and give it so much milk of pious sentimentfootnote: an expression from schillers william tell act iv scene. to drink that it will lie down quiet and forgotten in its oldcorner.--one ought to learn anew about cruelty and open ones eyes;one ought at last to learn impatience in order that such immodestgross errors--as for instance have been fostered by ancient andmodern philosophers with regard to tragedy--may no longer wander aboutvirtuously and boldly. almost everything that we call higher cultureis based upon the spiritualising and intensifying of cruelty--this ismy thesis; the wild beast has not been slain at all it lives itflourishes it has only been--transfigured. that which constitutes thepainful delight of tragedy is cruelty; that which operates agreeably inso-called tragic sympathy and at the basis even of everything sublimeup to the highest and most delicate thrills of metaphysics obtains itssweetness solely from the intermingled ingredient of cruelty. what theroman enjoys in the arena the christian in the ecstasies of the crossthe spaniard at the sight of the faggot and stake or of the bull-fightthe present-day japanese who presses his way to the tragedy the workmanof the parisian suburbs who has a homesickness for bloody revolutionsthe wagnerienne who with unhinged will undergoes the performance oftristan and isolde--what all these enjoy and strive with mysteriousardour to drink in is the philtre of the great circe cruelty. hereto be sure we must put aside entirely the blundering psychology offormer times which could only teach with regard to cruelty thatit originated at the sight of the suffering of others: there is anabundant super-abundant enjoyment even in ones own suffering incausing ones own suffering--and wherever man has allowed himself to bepersuaded to self-denial in the religious sense or to self-mutilationas among the phoenicians and ascetics or in general todesensualisation decarnalisation and contrition to puritanicalrepentance-spasms to vivisection of conscience and to pascal-likesacrifizia dell intelleto he is secretly allured and impelledforwards by his cruelty by the dangerous thrill of cruelty towardshimself.--finally let us consider that even the seeker of knowledgeoperates as an artist and glorifier of cruelty in that he compels hisspirit to perceive against its own inclination and often enough againstthe wishes of his heart:--he forces it to say nay where he would liketo affirm love and adore; indeed every instance of taking a thingprofoundly and fundamentally is a violation an intentional injuringof the fundamental will of the spirit which instinctively aims atappearance and superficiality--even in every desire for knowledge thereis a drop of cruelty.. perhaps what i have said here about a fundamental will of thespirit may not be understood without further details; i may be alloweda word of explanation.--that imperious something which is popularlycalled the spirit wishes to be master internally and externallyand to feel itself master; it has the will of a multiplicity for asimplicity a binding taming imperious and essentially ruling will.its requirements and capacities here are the same as those assigned byphysiologists to everything that lives grows and multiplies. the powerof the spirit to appropriate foreign elements reveals itself in a strongtendency to assimilate the new to the old to simplify the manifoldto overlook or repudiate the absolutely contradictory; just as itarbitrarily re-underlines makes prominent and falsifies for itselfcertain traits and lines in the foreign elements in every portion ofthe outside world. its object thereby is the incorporation of newexperiences the assortment of new things in the old arrangements--inshort growth; or more properly the feeling of growth the feeling ofincreased power--is its object. this same will has at its service anapparently opposed impulse of the spirit a suddenly adopted preferenceof ignorance of arbitrary shutting out a closing of windows an innerdenial of this or that a prohibition to approach a sort of defensiveattitude against much that is knowable a contentment with obscuritywith the shutting-in horizon an acceptance and approval of ignorance:as that which is all necessary according to the degree of itsappropriating power its digestive power to speak figuratively andin fact the spirit resembles a stomach more than anything else. herealso belong an occasional propensity of the spirit to let itself bedeceived perhaps with a waggish suspicion that it is not so and sobut is only allowed to pass as such a delight in uncertainty andambiguity an exulting enjoyment of arbitrary out-of-the-way narrownessand mystery of the too-near of the foreground of the magnifiedthe diminished the misshapen the beautified--an enjoyment of thearbitrariness of all these manifestations of power. finally in thisconnection there is the not unscrupulous readiness of the spirit todeceive other spirits and dissemble before them--the constant pressingand straining of a creating shaping changeable power: the spiritenjoys therein its craftiness and its variety of disguises it enjoysalso its feeling of security therein--it is precisely by its proteanarts that it is best protected and concealed!--counter to thispropensity for appearance for simplification for a disguise for acloak in short for an outside--for every outside is a cloak--thereoperates the sublime tendency of the man of knowledge which takes andinsists on taking things profoundly variously and thoroughly; as akind of cruelty of the intellectual conscience and taste which everycourageous thinker will acknowledge in himself provided as it oughtto be that he has sharpened and hardened his eye sufficiently long forintrospection and is accustomed to severe discipline and even severewords. he will say: there is something cruel in the tendency of myspirit: let the virtuous and amiable try to convince him that it is notso! in fact it would sound nicer if instead of our cruelty perhapsour extravagant honesty were talked about whispered about andglorified--we free very free spirits--and some day perhaps such willactually be our--posthumous glory! meanwhile--for there is plenty oftime until then--we should be least inclined to deck ourselves out insuch florid and fringed moral verbiage; our whole former work hasjust made us sick of this taste and its sprightly exuberance. they arebeautiful glistening jingling festive words: honesty love of truthlove of wisdom sacrifice for knowledge heroism of the truthful--thereis something in them that makes ones heart swell with pride. but weanchorites and marmots have long ago persuaded ourselves in all thesecrecy of an anchorites conscience that this worthy parade ofverbiage also belongs to the old false adornment frippery andgold-dust of unconscious human vanity and that even under suchflattering colour and repainting the terrible original text homo naturamust again be recognized. in effect to translate man back again intonature; to master the many vain and visionary interpretations andsubordinate meanings which have hitherto been scratched and daubed overthe eternal original text homo natura; to bring it about that man shallhenceforth stand before man as he now hardened by the disciplineof science stands before the other forms of nature with fearlessoedipus-eyes and stopped ulysses-ears deaf to the enticements of oldmetaphysical bird-catchers who have piped to him far too long: thouart more! thou art higher! thou hast a different origin!--this may bea strange and foolish task but that it is a task who can deny! why didwe choose it this foolish task or to put the question differently:why knowledge at all every one will ask us about this. and thuspressed we who have asked ourselves the question a hundred times havenot found and cannot find any better answer..... learning alters us it does what all nourishment does that does notmerely conserve--as the physiologist knows. but at the bottom of oursouls quite down below there is certainly something unteachablea granite of spiritual fate of predetermined decision and answer topredetermined chosen questions. in each cardinal problem there speaksan unchangeable i am this; a thinker cannot learn anew about man andwoman for instance but can only learn fully--he can only follow to theend what is fixed about them in himself. occasionally we find certainsolutions of problems which make strong beliefs for us; perhaps theyare henceforth called convictions. later on--one sees in them onlyfootsteps to self-knowledge guide-posts to the problem which weourselves are--or more correctly to the great stupidity which we embodyour spiritual fate the unteachable in us quite down below.--in viewof this liberal compliment which i have just paid myself permissionwill perhaps be more readily allowed me to utter some truths aboutwoman as she is provided that it is known at the outset how literallythey are merely--my truths.. woman wishes to be independent and therefore she begins toenlighten men about woman as she is--this is one of the worstdevelopments of the general uglifying of europe. for what must theseclumsy attempts of feminine scientificality and self-exposure bringto light! woman has so much cause for shame; in woman there is somuch pedantry superficiality schoolmasterliness petty presumptionunbridledness and indiscretion concealed--study only womans behaviourtowards children!--which has really been best restrained and dominatedhitherto by the fear of man. alas if ever the eternally tedious inwoman--she has plenty of it!--is allowed to venture forth! if shebegins radically and on principle to unlearn her wisdom and art-ofcharming of playing of frightening away sorrow of alleviating andtaking easily; if she forgets her delicate aptitude for agreeabledesires! female voices are already raised which by saint aristophanes!make one afraid:--with medical explicitness it is stated in athreatening manner what woman first and last requires from man. isit not in the very worst taste that woman thus sets herself up to bescientific enlightenment hitherto has fortunately been mens affairmens gift--we remained therewith among ourselves; and in the endin view of all that women write about woman we may well haveconsiderable doubt as to whether woman really desires enlightenmentabout herself--and can desire it. if woman does not thereby seek a newornament for herself--i believe ornamentation belongs to the eternallyfeminine--why then she wishes to make herself feared: perhaps shethereby wishes to get the mastery. but she does not want truth--whatdoes woman care for truth from the very first nothing is more foreignmore repugnant or more hostile to woman than truth--her great art isfalsehood her chief concern is appearance and beauty. let us confessit we men: we honour and love this very art and this very instinct inwoman: we who have the hard task and for our recreation gladly seek thecompany of beings under whose hands glances and delicate follies ourseriousness our gravity and profundity appear almost like follies tous. finally i ask the question: did a woman herself ever acknowledgeprofundity in a womans mind or justice in a womans heart and is itnot true that on the whole woman has hitherto been most despised bywoman herself and not at all by us--we men desire that woman shouldnot continue to compromise herself by enlightening us; just as it wasmans care and the consideration for woman when the church decreed:mulier taceat in ecclesia. it was to the benefit of woman when napoleongave the too eloquent madame de stael to understand: mulier taceat inpoliticis!--and in my opinion he is a true friend of woman who callsout to women today: mulier taceat de mulierel.. it betrays corruption of the instincts--apart from the fact thatit betrays bad taste--when a woman refers to madame roland or madame destael or monsieur george sand as though something were proved therebyin favour of woman as she is. among men these are the three comicalwomen as they are--nothing more!--and just the best involuntarycounter-arguments against feminine emancipation and autonomy.. stupidity in the kitchen; woman as cook; the terriblethoughtlessness with which the feeding of the family and the master ofthe house is managed! woman does not understand what food means and sheinsists on being cook! if woman had been a thinking creature she shouldcertainly as cook for thousands of years have discovered the mostimportant physiological facts and should likewise have got possessionof the healing art! through bad female cooks--through the entire lackof reason in the kitchen--the development of mankind has been longestretarded and most interfered with: even today matters are very littlebetter. a word to high school girls.. there are turns and casts of fancy there are sentences littlehandfuls of words in which a whole culture a whole society suddenlycrystallises itself. among these is the incidental remark of madame delambert to her son: mon ami ne vous permettez jamais que des foliesqui vous feront grand plaisir--the motherliest and wisest remark bythe way that was ever addressed to a son.. i have no doubt that every noble woman will oppose what dante andgoethe believed about woman--the former when he sang ella guardavasuso ed io in lei and the latter when he interpreted it theeternally feminine draws us aloft; for this is just what she believesof the eternally masculine..seven apophthegms for womenhow the longest ennui flees when a man comes to our knees!age alas! and science staid furnish even weak virtue aid.sombre garb and silence meet: dress for every dame--discreet.whom i thank when in my bliss god!--and my good tailoress!young a flower-decked cavern home; old a dragon thence doth roam.noble title leg thats fine man as well: oh were he mine!speech in brief and sense in mass--slippery for the jenny-ass!a. woman has hitherto been treated by men like birds which losingtheir way have come down among them from an elevation: as somethingdelicate fragile wild strange sweet and animating--but as somethingalso which must be cooped up to prevent it flying away.. to be mistaken in the fundamental problem of man and woman todeny here the profoundest antagonism and the necessity for an eternallyhostile tension to dream here perhaps of equal rights equaltraining equal claims and obligations: that is a typical sign ofshallow-mindedness; and a thinker who has proved himself shallow atthis dangerous spot--shallow in instinct!--may generally be regarded assuspicious nay more as betrayed as discovered; he will probably provetoo short for all fundamental questions of life future as well aspresent and will be unable to descend into any of the depths. on theother hand a man who has depth of spirit as well as of desires andhas also the depth of benevolence which is capable of severity andharshness and easily confounded with them can only think of woman asorientals do: he must conceive of her as a possession as confinableproperty as a being predestined for service and accomplishing hermission therein--he must take his stand in this matter upon the immenserationality of asia upon the superiority of the instinct of asia asthe greeks did formerly; those best heirs and scholars of asia--whoas is well known with their increasing culture and amplitude of powerfrom homer to the time of pericles became gradually stricter towardswoman in short more oriental. how necessary how logical even howhumanely desirable this was let us consider for ourselves!. the weaker sex has in no previous age been treated with somuch respect by men as at present--this belongs to the tendency andfundamental taste of democracy in the same way as disrespectfulness toold age--what wonder is it that abuse should be immediately made ofthis respect they want more they learn to make claims the tributeof respect is at last felt to be well-nigh galling; rivalry for rightsindeed actual strife itself would be preferred: in a word woman islosing modesty. and let us immediately add that she is also losingtaste. she is unlearning to fear man: but the woman who unlearns tofear sacrifices her most womanly instincts. that woman should ventureforward when the fear-inspiring quality in man--or more definitelythe man in man--is no longer either desired or fully developed isreasonable enough and also intelligible enough; what is more difficultto understand is that precisely thereby--woman deteriorates. this iswhat is happening nowadays: let us not deceive ourselves about it!wherever the industrial spirit has triumphed over the militaryand aristocratic spirit woman strives for the economic and legalindependence of a clerk: woman as clerkess is inscribed on the portalof the modern society which is in course of formation. while shethus appropriates new rights aspires to be master and inscribesprogress of woman on her flags and banners the very opposite realisesitself with terrible obviousness: woman retrogrades. since the frenchrevolution the influence of woman in europe has declined in proportionas she has increased her rights and claims; and the emancipation ofwoman insofar as it is desired and demanded by women themselves andnot only by masculine shallow-pates thus proves to be a remarkablesymptom of the increased weakening and deadening of the most womanlyinstincts. there is stupidity in this movement an almost masculinestupidity of which a well-reared woman--who is always a sensiblewoman--might be heartily ashamed. to lose the intuition as to the groundupon which she can most surely achieve victory; to neglect exercise inthe use of her proper weapons; to let-herself-go before man perhapseven to the book where formerly she kept herself in control and inrefined artful humility; to neutralize with her virtuous audacity mansfaith in a veiled fundamentally different ideal in woman somethingeternally necessarily feminine; to emphatically and loquaciouslydissuade man from the idea that woman must be preserved cared forprotected and indulged like some delicate strangely wild andoften pleasant domestic animal; the clumsy and indignant collection ofeverything of the nature of servitude and bondage which the position ofwoman in the hitherto existing order of society has entailed and stillentails as though slavery were a counter-argument and not rather acondition of every higher culture of every elevation of culture:--whatdoes all this betoken if not a disintegration of womanly instinctsa defeminising certainly there are enough of idiotic friends andcorrupters of woman among the learned asses of the masculine sex whoadvise woman to defeminize herself in this manner and to imitateall the stupidities from which man in europe european manlinesssuffers--who would like to lower woman to general culture indeedeven to newspaper reading and meddling with politics. here and therethey wish even to make women into free spirits and literary workers: asthough a woman without piety would not be something perfectly obnoxiousor ludicrous to a profound and godless man;--almost everywhere hernerves are being ruined by the most morbid and dangerous kind of musicour latest german music and she is daily being made more hystericaland more incapable of fulfilling her first and last function that ofbearing robust children. they wish to cultivate her in general stillmore and intend as they say to make the weaker sex strong byculture: as if history did not teach in the most emphatic manner thatthe cultivating of mankind and his weakening--that is to say theweakening dissipating and languishing of his force of will--havealways kept pace with one another and that the most powerful andinfluential women in the world and lastly the mother of napoleonhad just to thank their force of will--and not their schoolmasters--fortheir power and ascendancy over men. that which inspires respectin woman and often enough fear also is her nature which is morenatural than that of man her genuine carnivora-like cunningflexibility her tiger-claws beneath the glove her naivete in egoismher untrainableness and innate wildness the incomprehensiblenessextent and deviation of her desires and virtues. that which in spiteof fear excites ones sympathy for the dangerous and beautiful catwoman is that she seems more afflicted more vulnerable morenecessitous of love and more condemned to disillusionment than anyother creature. fear and sympathy it is with these feelings that man hashitherto stood in the presence of woman always with one foot already intragedy which rends while it delights--what and all that is now tobe at an end and the disenchantment of woman is in progress thetediousness of woman is slowly evolving oh europe! europe! we knowthe horned animal which was always most attractive to thee from whichdanger is ever again threatening thee! thy old fable might once morebecome history--an immense stupidity might once again overmasterthee and carry thee away! and no god concealed beneath it--no! only anidea a modern idea!chapter viii. peoples and countries. i heard once again for the first time richard wagners overtureto the mastersinger: it is a piece of magnificent gorgeous heavylatter-day art which has the pride to presuppose two centuries of musicas still living in order that it may be understood:--it is an honourto germans that such a pride did not miscalculate! what flavoursand forces what seasons and climes do we not find mingled in it! itimpresses us at one time as ancient at another time as foreign bitterand too modern it is as arbitrary as it is pompously traditional itis not infrequently roguish still oftener rough and coarse--it has fireand courage and at the same time the loose dun-coloured skin of fruitswhich ripen too late. it flows broad and full: and suddenly there is amoment of inexplicable hesitation like a gap that opens between causeand effect an oppression that makes us dream almost a nightmare; butalready it broadens and widens anew the old stream of delight--the mostmanifold delight--of old and new happiness; including especiallythe joy of the artist in himself which he refuses to conceal hisastonished happy cognizance of his mastery of the expedients hereemployed the new newly acquired imperfectly tested expedients of artwhich he apparently betrays to us. all in all however no beauty nosouth nothing of the delicate southern clearness of the sky nothingof grace no dance hardly a will to logic; a certain clumsiness evenwhich is also emphasized as though the artist wished to say to us: itis part of my intention; a cumbersome drapery something arbitrarilybarbaric and ceremonious a flirring of learned and venerable conceitsand witticisms; something german in the best and worst sense ofthe word something in the german style manifold formless andinexhaustible; a certain german potency and super-plenitude ofsoul which is not afraid to hide itself under the raffinements ofdecadence--which perhaps feels itself most at ease there; a realgenuine token of the german soul which is at the same time young andaged too ripe and yet still too rich in futurity. this kind of musicexpresses best what i think of the germans: they belong to the daybefore yesterday and the day after tomorrow--they have as yet no today.. we good europeans we also have hours when we allow ourselves awarm-hearted patriotism a plunge and relapse into old loves and narrowviews--i have just given an example of it--hours of national excitementof patriotic anguish and all other sorts of old-fashioned floods ofsentiment. duller spirits may perhaps only get done with what confinesits operations in us to hours and plays itself out in hours--in aconsiderable time: some in half a year others in half a lifetimeaccording to the speed and strength with which they digest and changetheir material. indeed i could think of sluggish hesitating raceswhich even in our rapidly moving europe would require half a centuryere they could surmount such atavistic attacks of patriotism andsoil-attachment and return once more to reason that is to say togood europeanism. and while digressing on this possibility ihappen to become an ear-witness of a conversation between two oldpatriots--they were evidently both hard of hearing and consequentlyspoke all the louder. he has as much and knows as much philosophy asa peasant or a corps-student said the one--he is still innocent. butwhat does that matter nowadays! it is the age of the masses: they lie ontheir belly before everything that is massive. and so also in politicis.a statesman who rears up for them a new tower of babel some monstrosityof empire and power they call great--what does it matter that we moreprudent and conservative ones do not meanwhile give up the old beliefthat it is only the great thought that gives greatness to an action oraffair. supposing a statesman were to bring his people into the positionof being obliged henceforth to practise high politics for which theywere by nature badly endowed and prepared so that they would haveto sacrifice their old and reliable virtues out of love to a new anddoubtful mediocrity;--supposing a statesman were to condemn his peoplegenerally to practise politics when they have hitherto had somethingbetter to do and think about and when in the depths of their soulsthey have been unable to free themselves from a prudent loathing ofthe restlessness emptiness and noisy wranglings of the essentiallypolitics-practising nations;--supposing such a statesman were tostimulate the slumbering passions and avidities of his people were tomake a stigma out of their former diffidence and delight in aloofnessan offence out of their exoticism and hidden permanency were todepreciate their most radical proclivities subvert their consciencesmake their minds narrow and their tastes national--what! a statesmanwho should do all this which his people would have to do penance forthroughout their whole future if they had a future such a statesmanwould be great would he--undoubtedly! replied the other old patriotvehemently otherwise he could not have done it! it was mad perhaps towish such a thing! but perhaps everything great has been just as madat its commencement!--misuse of words! cried his interlocutorcontradictorily--strong! strong! strong and mad! not great!--the oldmen had obviously become heated as they thus shouted their truths ineach others faces but i in my happiness and apartness considered howsoon a stronger one may become master of the strong and also thatthere is a compensation for the intellectual superficialising of anation--namely in the deepening of another.. whether we call it civilization or humanising or progresswhich now distinguishes the european whether we call it simply withoutpraise or blame by the political formula the democratic movement ineurope--behind all the moral and political foregrounds pointed to bysuch formulas an immense physiological process goes on which is everextending the process of the assimilation of europeans theirincreasing detachment from the conditions under which climatically andhereditarily united races originate their increasing independence ofevery definite milieu that for centuries would fain inscribe itselfwith equal demands on soul and body--that is to say the slow emergenceof an essentially super-national and nomadic species of man whopossesses physiologically speaking a maximum of the art and powerof adaptation as his typical distinction. this process of the evolvingeuropean which can be retarded in its tempo by great relapses butwill perhaps just gain and grow thereby in vehemence and depth--thestill-raging storm and stress of national sentiment pertains to itand also the anarchism which is appearing at present--this processwill probably arrive at results on which its naive propagators andpanegyrists the apostles of modern ideas would least care to reckon.the same new conditions under which on an average a levelling andmediocrising of man will take place--a useful industrious variouslyserviceable and clever gregarious man--are in the highest degreesuitable to give rise to exceptional men of the most dangerous andattractive qualities. for while the capacity for adaptation which isevery day trying changing conditions and begins a new work with everygeneration almost with every decade makes the powerfulness of the typeimpossible; while the collective impression of such future europeanswill probably be that of numerous talkative weak-willed and veryhandy workmen who require a master a commander as they require theirdaily bread; while therefore the democratising of europe will tend tothe production of a type prepared for slavery in the most subtlesense of the term: the strong man will necessarily in individual andexceptional cases become stronger and richer than he has perhaps everbeen before--owing to the unprejudicedness of his schooling owing tothe immense variety of practice art and disguise. i meant to saythat the democratising of europe is at the same time an involuntaryarrangement for the rearing of tyrants--taking the word in all itsmeanings even in its most spiritual sense.. i hear with pleasure that our sun is moving rapidly towards theconstellation hercules: and i hope that the men on this earth will dolike the sun. and we foremost we good europeans!. there was a time when it was customary to call germans deepby way of distinction; but now that the most successful type of newgermanism is covetous of quite other honours and perhaps missessmartness in all that has depth it is almost opportune and patrioticto doubt whether we did not formerly deceive ourselves with thatcommendation: in short whether german depth is not at bottom somethingdifferent and worse--and something from which thank god we are on thepoint of successfully ridding ourselves. let us try then to relearnwith regard to german depth; the only thing necessary for the purpose isa little vivisection of the german soul.--the german soul is above allmanifold varied in its source aggregated and super-imposed ratherthan actually built: this is owing to its origin. a german who wouldembolden himself to assert: two souls alas dwell in my breast wouldmake a bad guess at the truth or more correctly he would come farshort of the truth about the number of souls. as a people made up ofthe most extraordinary mixing and mingling of races perhaps even with apreponderance of the pre-aryan element as the people of the centre inevery sense of the term the germans are more intangible more amplemore contradictory more unknown more incalculable more surprisingand even more terrifying than other peoples are to themselves:--theyescape definition and are thereby alone the despair of the french. itis characteristic of the germans that the question: what is germannever dies out among them. kotzebue certainly knew his germans wellenough: we are known they cried jubilantly to him--but sand alsothought he knew them. jean paul knew what he was doing when he declaredhimself incensed at fichtes lying but patriotic flatteries andexaggerations--but it is probable that goethe thought differently aboutgermans from jean paul even though he acknowledged him to be right withregard to fichte. it is a question what goethe really thought about thegermans--but about many things around him he never spoke explicitlyand all his life he knew how to keep an astute silence--probably hehad good reason for it. it is certain that it was not the wars ofindependence that made him look up more joyfully any more than it wasthe french revolution--the event on account of which he reconstructedhis faust and indeed the whole problem of man was the appearanceof napoleon. there are words of goethe in which he condemns withimpatient severity as from a foreign land that which germans take apride in he once defined the famous german turn of mind as indulgencetowards its own and others weaknesses. was he wrong it ischaracteristic of germans that one is seldom entirely wrong about them.the german soul has passages and galleries in it there are caveshiding-places and dungeons therein its disorder has much of the charmof the mysterious the german is well acquainted with the bypaths tochaos. and as everything loves its symbol so the german loves theclouds and all that is obscure evolving crepuscular damp andshrouded it seems to him that everything uncertain undevelopedself-displacing and growing is deep. the german himself does notexist he is becoming he is developing himself. development istherefore the essentially german discovery and hit in the great domainof philosophical formulas--a ruling idea which together with germanbeer and german music is labouring to germanise all europe. foreignersare astonished and attracted by the riddles which the conflicting natureat the basis of the german soul propounds to them riddles whichhegel systematised and richard wagner has in the end set to music.good-natured and spiteful--such a juxtaposition preposterous in thecase of every other people is unfortunately only too often justifiedin germany one has only to live for a while among swabians to know this!the clumsiness of the german scholar and his social distastefulnessagree alarmingly well with his physical rope-dancing and nimbleboldness of which all the gods have learnt to be afraid. if any onewishes to see the german soul demonstrated ad oculos let himonly look at german taste at german arts and manners what boorishindifference to taste! how the noblest and the commonest stand therein juxtaposition! how disorderly and how rich is the whole constitutionof this soul! the german drags at his soul he drags at everything heexperiences. he digests his events badly; he never gets donewith them; and german depth is often only a difficult hesitatingdigestion. and just as all chronic invalids all dyspeptics like whatis convenient so the german loves frankness and honesty; it isso convenient to be frank and honest!--this confidingness thiscomplaisance this showing-the-cards of german honesty is probably themost dangerous and most successful disguise which the german is up tonowadays: it is his proper mephistophelean art; with this he can stillachieve much! the german lets himself go and thereby gazes withfaithful blue empty german eyes--and other countries immediatelyconfound him with his dressing-gown!--i meant to say that let germandepth be what it will--among ourselves alone we perhaps take theliberty to laugh at it--we shall do well to continue henceforth tohonour its appearance and good name and not barter away too cheaply ourold reputation as a people of depth for prussian smartness andberlin wit and sand. it is wise for a people to pose and let itselfbe regarded as profound clumsy good-natured honest and foolish: itmight even be--profound to do so! finally we should do honour toour name--we are not called the tiusche volk deceptive people fornothing..... the good old time is past it sang itself out in mozart--howhappy are we that his rococo still speaks to us that his goodcompany his tender enthusiasm his childish delight in the chinese andits flourishes his courtesy of heart his longing for the elegant theamorous the tripping the tearful and his belief in the south canstill appeal to something left in us! ah some time or other it will beover with it!--but who can doubt that it will be over still sooner withthe intelligence and taste for beethoven! for he was only the last echoof a break and transition in style and not like mozart the last echoof a great european taste which had existed for centuries. beethovenis the intermediate event between an old mellow soul that is constantlybreaking down and a future over-young soul that is always coming;there is spread over his music the twilight of eternal loss and eternalextravagant hope--the same light in which europe was bathed when itdreamed with rousseau when it danced round the tree of liberty of therevolution and finally almost fell down in adoration before napoleon.but how rapidly does this very sentiment now pale how difficultnowadays is even the apprehension of this sentiment how strangely doesthe language of rousseau schiller shelley and byron sound to our earin whom collectively the same fate of europe was able to speak whichknew how to sing in beethoven!--whatever german music came afterwardsbelongs to romanticism that is to say to a movement whichhistorically considered was still shorter more fleeting and moresuperficial than that great interlude the transition of europe fromrousseau to napoleon and to the rise of democracy. weber--but what dowe care nowadays for freischutz and oberon! or marschners hansheiling and vampyre! or even wagners tannhauser! that is extinctalthough not yet forgotten music. this whole music of romanticismbesides was not noble enough was not musical enough to maintain itsposition anywhere but in the theatre and before the masses; from thebeginning it was second-rate music which was little thought of bygenuine musicians. it was different with felix mendelssohn that halcyonmaster who on account of his lighter purer happier soul quicklyacquired admiration and was equally quickly forgotten: as the beautifulepisode of german music. but with regard to robert schumann who tookthings seriously and has been taken seriously from the first--hewas the last that founded a school--do we not now regard it as asatisfaction a relief a deliverance that this very romanticismof schumanns has been surmounted schumann fleeing into the saxonswitzerland of his soul with a half werther-like half jean-paul-likenature assuredly not like beethoven! assuredly not like byron!--hismanfred music is a mistake and a misunderstanding to the extent ofinjustice; schumann with his taste which was fundamentally a pettytaste that is to say a dangerous propensity--doubly dangerous amonggermans--for quiet lyricism and intoxication of the feelings goingconstantly apart timidly withdrawing and retiring a noble weakling whorevelled in nothing but anonymous joy and sorrow from the beginninga sort of girl and noli me tangere--this schumann was already merely agerman event in music and no longer a european event as beethoven hadbeen as in a still greater degree mozart had been; with schumann germanmusic was threatened with its greatest danger that of losing the voicefor the soul of europe and sinking into a merely national affair.. what a torture are books written in german to a reader who has athird ear! how indignantly he stands beside the slowly turning swampof sounds without tune and rhythms without dance which germans calla book! and even the german who reads books! how lazily howreluctantly how badly he reads! how many germans know and consider itobligatory to know that there is art in every good sentence--art whichmust be divined if the sentence is to be understood! if there is amisunderstanding about its tempo for instance the sentence itselfis misunderstood! that one must not be doubtful about therhythm-determining syllables that one should feel the breaking of thetoo-rigid symmetry as intentional and as a charm that one should lend afine and patient ear to every staccato and every rubato that one shoulddivine the sense in the sequence of the vowels and diphthongs and howdelicately and richly they can be tinted and retinted in the order oftheir arrangement--who among book-reading germans is complaisant enoughto recognize such duties and requirements and to listen to so much artand intention in language after all one just has no ear for it;and so the most marked contrasts of style are not heard and the mostdelicate artistry is as it were squandered on the deaf.--these were mythoughts when i noticed how clumsily and unintuitively two masters inthe art of prose-writing have been confounded: one whose words dropdown hesitatingly and coldly as from the roof of a damp cave--he countson their dull sound and echo; and another who manipulates his languagelike a flexible sword and from his arm down into his toes feels thedangerous bliss of the quivering over-sharp blade which wishes tobite hiss and cut.. how little the german style has to do with harmony and with theear is shown by the fact that precisely our good musicians themselveswrite badly. the german does not read aloud he does not read for theear but only with his eyes; he has put his ears away in the drawer forthe time. in antiquity when a man read--which was seldom enough--he readsomething to himself and in a loud voice; they were surprised whenany one read silently and sought secretly the reason of it. in aloud voice: that is to say with all the swellings inflections andvariations of key and changes of tempo in which the ancient publicworld took delight. the laws of the written style were then the sameas those of the spoken style; and these laws depended partly on thesurprising development and refined requirements of the ear and larynx;partly on the strength endurance and power of the ancient lungs. inthe ancient sense a period is above all a physiological whole inasmuchas it is comprised in one breath. such periods as occur in demosthenesand cicero swelling twice and sinking twice and all in one breathwere pleasures to the men of antiquity who knew by their own schoolinghow to appreciate the virtue therein the rareness and the difficultyin the deliverance of such a period;--we have really no right to thebig period we modern men who are short of breath in every sense! thoseancients indeed were all of them dilettanti in speaking consequentlyconnoisseurs consequently critics--they thus brought their orators tothe highest pitch; in the same manner as in the last century when allitalian ladies and gentlemen knew how to sing the virtuosoship of songand with it also the art of melody reached its elevation. in germanyhowever until quite recently when a kind of platform eloquence beganshyly and awkwardly enough to flutter its young wings there wasproperly speaking only one kind of public and approximately artisticaldiscourse--that delivered from the pulpit. the preacher was the only onein germany who knew the weight of a syllable or a word in what manner asentence strikes springs rushes flows and comes to a close; he alonehad a conscience in his ears often enough a bad conscience: for reasonsare not lacking why proficiency in oratory should be especially seldomattained by a german or almost always too late. the masterpiece ofgerman prose is therefore with good reason the masterpiece of itsgreatest preacher: the bible has hitherto been the best germanbook. compared with luthers bible almost everything else is merelyliterature--something which has not grown in germany and thereforehas not taken and does not take root in german hearts as the bible hasdone.. there are two kinds of geniuses: one which above all engenders andseeks to engender and another which willingly lets itself be fructifiedand brings forth. and similarly among the gifted nations there arethose on whom the womans problem of pregnancy has devolved and thesecret task of forming maturing and perfecting--the greeks forinstance were a nation of this kind and so are the french; and otherswhich have to fructify and become the cause of new modes of life--likethe jews the romans and in all modesty be it asked: like thegermans--nations tortured and enraptured by unknown fevers andirresistibly forced out of themselves amorous and longing forforeign races for such as let themselves be fructified and withalimperious like everything conscious of being full of generative forceand consequently empowered by the grace of god. these two kinds ofgeniuses seek each other like man and woman; but they also misunderstandeach other--like man and woman.. every nation has its own tartuffery and calls that itsvirtue.--one does not know--cannot know the best that is in one.. what europe owes to the jews--many things good and bad and aboveall one thing of the nature both of the best and the worst: the grandstyle in morality the fearfulness and majesty of infinite demands ofinfinite significations the whole romanticism and sublimity of moralquestionableness--and consequently just the most attractive ensnaringand exquisite element in those iridescences and allurements to lifein the aftersheen of which the sky of our european culture its eveningsky now glows--perhaps glows out. for this we artists among thespectators and philosophers are--grateful to the jews.. it must be taken into the bargain if various clouds anddisturbances--in short slight attacks of stupidity--pass over thespirit of a people that suffers and wants to suffer from nationalnervous fever and political ambition: for instance among present-daygermans there is alternately the anti-french folly the anti-semiticfolly the anti-polish folly the christian-romantic folly thewagnerian folly the teutonic folly the prussian folly just look atthose poor historians the sybels and treitschkes and their closelybandaged heads and whatever else these little obscurations of thegerman spirit and conscience may be called. may it be forgiven me thati too when on a short daring sojourn on very infected ground did notremain wholly exempt from the disease but like every one else beganto entertain thoughts about matters which did not concern me--the firstsymptom of political infection. about the jews for instance listento the following:--i have never yet met a german who was favourablyinclined to the jews; and however decided the repudiation of actualanti-semitism may be on the part of all prudent and political men thisprudence and policy is not perhaps directed against the nature of thesentiment itself but only against its dangerous excess and especiallyagainst the distasteful and infamous expression of this excess ofsentiment;--on this point we must not deceive ourselves. that germanyhas amply sufficient jews that the german stomach the german bloodhas difficulty and will long have difficulty in disposing only of thisquantity of jew--as the italian the frenchman and the englishmanhave done by means of a stronger digestion:--that is the unmistakabledeclaration and language of a general instinct to which one must listenand according to which one must act. let no more jews come in! and shutthe doors especially towards the east also towards austria!--thuscommands the instinct of a people whose nature is still feeble anduncertain so that it could be easily wiped out easily extinguished bya stronger race. the jews however are beyond all doubt the strongesttoughest and purest race at present living in europe they know howto succeed even under the worst conditions in fact better than underfavourable ones by means of virtues of some sort which one would likenowadays to label as vices--owing above all to a resolute faith whichdoes not need to be ashamed before modern ideas they alter onlywhen they do alter in the same way that the russian empire makesits conquest--as an empire that has plenty of time and is not ofyesterday--namely according to the principle as slowly as possible!a thinker who has the future of europe at heart will in all hisperspectives concerning the future calculate upon the jews as hewill calculate upon the russians as above all the surest and likeliestfactors in the great play and battle of forces. that which is at presentcalled a nation in europe and is really rather a res facta than nataindeed sometimes confusingly similar to a res ficta et picta is inevery case something evolving young easily displaced and not yeta race much less such a race aere perennus as the jews are suchnations should most carefully avoid all hot-headed rivalry andhostility! it is certain that the jews if they desired--or if theywere driven to it as the anti-semites seem to wish--could now have theascendancy nay literally the supremacy over europe that they are notworking and planning for that end is equally certain. meanwhile theyrather wish and desire even somewhat importunely to be insorbed andabsorbed by europe they long to be finally settled authorized andrespected somewhere and wish to put an end to the nomadic life to thewandering jew--and one should certainly take account of this impulseand tendency and make advances to it it possibly betokens a mitigationof the jewish instincts for which purpose it would perhaps be usefuland fair to banish the anti-semitic bawlers out of the country. oneshould make advances with all prudence and with selection pretty muchas the english nobility do it stands to reason that the more powerfuland strongly marked types of new germanism could enter into relationwith the jews with the least hesitation for instance the noblemanofficer from the prussian border it would be interesting in many waysto see whether the genius for money and patience and especially someintellect and intellectuality--sadly lacking in the place referred tocould not in addition be annexed and trained to the hereditary art ofcommanding and obeying--for both of which the country in question hasnow a classic reputation but here it is expedient to break off my festaldiscourse and my sprightly teutonomania for i have already reached myserious topic the european problem as i understand it the rearingof a new ruling caste for europe.. they are not a philosophical race--the english: bacon represents anattack on the philosophical spirit generally hobbes hume and lockean abasement and a depreciation of the idea of a philosopher for morethan a century. it was against hume that kant uprose and raised himself;it was locke of whom schelling rightly said je meprise locke; in thestruggle against the english mechanical stultification of the worldhegel and schopenhauer along with goethe were of one accord; thetwo hostile brother-geniuses in philosophy who pushed in differentdirections towards the opposite poles of german thought and therebywronged each other as only brothers will do.--what is lacking inengland and has always been lacking that half-actor and rhetoricianknew well enough the absurd muddle-head carlyle who sought to concealunder passionate grimaces what he knew about himself: namely what waslacking in carlyle--real power of intellect real depth of intellectualperception in short philosophy. it is characteristic of such anunphilosophical race to hold on firmly to christianity--they need itsdiscipline for moralizing and humanizing. the englishman more gloomysensual headstrong and brutal than the german--is for that veryreason as the baser of the two also the most pious: he has all themore need of christianity. to finer nostrils this english christianityitself has still a characteristic english taint of spleen and alcoholicexcess for which owing to good reasons it is used as an antidote--thefiner poison to neutralize the coarser: a finer form of poisoning isin fact a step in advance with coarse-mannered people a step towardsspiritualization. the english coarseness and rustic demureness is stillmost satisfactorily disguised by christian pantomime and by prayingand psalm-singing or more correctly it is thereby explained anddifferently expressed; and for the herd of drunkards and rakes whoformerly learned moral grunting under the influence of methodism andmore recently as the salvation army a penitential fit may really bethe relatively highest manifestation of humanity to which they canbe elevated: so much may reasonably be admitted. that however whichoffends even in the humanest englishman is his lack of music to speakfiguratively and also literally: he has neither rhythm nor dance inthe movements of his soul and body; indeed not even the desire forrhythm and dance for music. listen to him speaking; look at the mostbeautiful englishwoman walking--in no country on earth are there morebeautiful doves and swans; finally listen to them singing! but i asktoo much.... there are truths which are best recognized by mediocre mindsbecause they are best adapted for them there are truths which onlypossess charms and seductive power for mediocre spirits:--one is pushedto this probably unpleasant conclusion now that the influence ofrespectable but mediocre englishmen--i may mention darwin johnstuart mill and herbert spencer--begins to gain the ascendancy in themiddle-class region of european taste. indeed who could doubt that itis a useful thing for such minds to have the ascendancy for a time itwould be an error to consider the highly developed and independentlysoaring minds as specially qualified for determining and collecting manylittle common facts and deducing conclusions from them; as exceptionsthey are rather from the first in no very favourable position towardsthose who are the rules. after all they have more to do than merelyto perceive:--in effect they have to be something new they have tosignify something new they have to represent new values! the gulfbetween knowledge and capacity is perhaps greater and also moremysterious than one thinks: the capable man in the grand style thecreator will possibly have to be an ignorant person;--while on theother hand for scientific discoveries like those of darwin a certainnarrowness aridity and industrious carefulness in short somethingenglish may not be unfavourable for arriving at them.--finally letit not be forgotten that the english with their profound mediocritybrought about once before a general depression of european intelligence.what is called modern ideas or the ideas of the eighteenth centuryor french ideas--that consequently against which the german mindrose up with profound disgust--is of english origin there is no doubtabout it. the french were only the apes and actors of these ideas theirbest soldiers and likewise alas! their first and profoundest victims;for owing to the diabolical anglomania of modern ideas the amefrancais has in the end become so thin and emaciated that at presentone recalls its sixteenth and seventeenth centuries its profoundpassionate strength its inventive excellency almost with disbelief.one must however maintain this verdict of historical justice ina determined manner and defend it against present prejudices andappearances: the european noblesse--of sentiment taste and mannerstaking the word in every high sense--is the work and invention offrance; the european ignobleness the plebeianism of modern ideas--isenglands work and invention.. even at present france is still the seat of the most intellectualand refined culture of europe it is still the high school of taste; butone must know how to find this france of taste. he who belongs to itkeeps himself well concealed:--they may be a small number in whom itlives and is embodied besides perhaps being men who do not stand uponthe strongest legs in part fatalists hypochondriacs invalids inpart persons over-indulged over-refined such as have the ambition toconceal themselves.they have all something in common: they keep their ears closed inpresence of the delirious folly and noisy spouting of the democraticbourgeois. in fact a besotted and brutalized france at present sprawlsin the foreground--it recently celebrated a veritable orgy of bad tasteand at the same time of self-admiration at the funeral of victor hugo.there is also something else common to them: a predilection to resistintellectual germanizing--and a still greater inability to do so!in this france of intellect which is also a france of pessimismschopenhauer has perhaps become more at home and more indigenous thanhe has ever been in germany; not to speak of heinrich heine who haslong ago been re-incarnated in the more refined and fastidious lyristsof paris; or of hegel who at present in the form of taine--the firstof living historians--exercises an almost tyrannical influence. asregards richard wagner however the more french music learns toadapt itself to the actual needs of the ame moderne the more will itwagnerite; one can safely predict that beforehand--it is alreadytaking place sufficiently! there are however three things which thefrench can still boast of with pride as their heritage and possessionand as indelible tokens of their ancient intellectual superiorityin europe in spite of all voluntary or involuntary germanizing andvulgarizing of taste. firstly the capacity for artistic emotion fordevotion to form for which the expression lart pour lart alongwith numerous others has been invented:--such capacity has not beenlacking in france for three centuries; and owing to its reverence forthe small number it has again and again made a sort of chambermusic of literature possible which is sought for in vain elsewherein europe.--the second thing whereby the french can lay claim toa superiority over europe is their ancient many-sided moralisticculture owing to which one finds on an average even in the pettyromanciers of the newspapers and chance boulevardiers de paris apsychological sensitiveness and curiosity of which for example onehas no conception to say nothing of the thing itself! in germany.the germans lack a couple of centuries of the moralistic work requisitethereto which as we have said france has not grudged: those who callthe germans naive on that account give them commendation for a defect.as the opposite of the german inexperience and innocence in voluptatepsychologica which is not too remotely associated with the tediousnessof german intercourse--and as the most successful expression ofgenuine french curiosity and inventive talent in this domain of delicatethrills henri beyle may be noted; that remarkable anticipatory andforerunning man who with a napoleonic tempo traversed his europein fact several centuries of the european soul as a surveyor anddiscoverer thereof:--it has required two generations to overtake himone way or other to divine long afterwards some of the riddlesthat perplexed and enraptured him--this strange epicurean and man ofinterrogation the last great psychologist of france.--there is yeta third claim to superiority: in the french character there is asuccessful half-way synthesis of the north and south which makes themcomprehend many things and enjoins upon them other things which anenglishman can never comprehend. their temperament turned alternatelyto and from the south in which from time to time the provencal andligurian blood froths over preserves them from the dreadful northerngrey-in-grey from sunless conceptual-spectrism and from poverty ofblood--our german infirmity of taste for the excessive prevalenceof which at the present moment blood and iron that is to say highpolitics has with great resolution been prescribed according toa dangerous healing art which bids me wait and wait but not yethope.--there is also still in france a pre-understanding andready welcome for those rarer and rarely gratified men who are toocomprehensive to find satisfaction in any kind of fatherlandism andknow how to love the south when in the north and the north when in thesouth--the born midlanders the good europeans. for them bizethas made music this latest genius who has seen a new beauty andseduction--who has discovered a piece of the south in music.. i hold that many precautions should be taken against german music.suppose a person loves the south as i love it--as a great schoolof recovery for the most spiritual and the most sensuous ills as aboundless solar profusion and effulgence which oerspreads a sovereignexistence believing in itself--well such a person will learn to besomewhat on his guard against german music because in injuring histaste anew it will also injure his health anew. such a southerner asoutherner not by origin but by belief if he should dream of the futureof music must also dream of it being freed from the influence of thenorth; and must have in his ears the prelude to a deeper mightier andperhaps more perverse and mysterious music a super-german music whichdoes not fade pale and die away as all german music does at thesight of the blue wanton sea and the mediterranean clearness of sky--asuper-european music which holds its own even in presence of the brownsunsets of the desert whose soul is akin to the palm-tree and can beat home and can roam with big beautiful lonely beasts of prey... icould imagine a music of which the rarest charm would be that it knewnothing more of good and evil; only that here and there perhaps somesailors home-sickness some golden shadows and tender weaknesses mightsweep lightly over it; an art which from the far distance would seethe colours of a sinking and almost incomprehensible moral world fleeingtowards it and would be hospitable enough and profound enough toreceive such belated fugitives.. owing to the morbid estrangement which the nationality-craze hasinduced and still induces among the nations of europe owing also to theshort-sighted and hasty-handed politicians who with the help of thiscraze are at present in power and do not suspect to what extent thedisintegrating policy they pursue must necessarily be only an interludepolicy--owing to all this and much else that is altogether unmentionableat present the most unmistakable signs that europe wishes to be oneare now overlooked or arbitrarily and falsely misinterpreted. with allthe more profound and large-minded men of this century the real generaltendency of the mysterious labour of their souls was to prepare the wayfor that new synthesis and tentatively to anticipate the european ofthe future; only in their simulations or in their weaker moments inold age perhaps did they belong to the fatherlands--they only restedfrom themselves when they became patriots. i think of such men asnapoleon goethe beethoven stendhal heinrich heine schopenhauer: itmust not be taken amiss if i also count richard wagner among them aboutwhom one must not let oneself be deceived by his own misunderstandingsgeniuses like him have seldom the right to understand themselvesstill less of course by the unseemly noise with which he is nowresisted and opposed in france: the fact remains nevertheless thatrichard wagner and the later french romanticism of the forties aremost closely and intimately related to one another. they are akinfundamentally akin in all the heights and depths of their requirements;it is europe the one europe whose soul presses urgently and longinglyoutwards and upwards in their multifarious and boisterous art--whitherinto a new light towards a new sun but who would attempt to expressaccurately what all these masters of new modes of speech could notexpress distinctly it is certain that the same storm and stresstormented them that they sought in the same manner these last greatseekers! all of them steeped in literature to their eyes and ears--thefirst artists of universal literary culture--for the most part eventhemselves writers poets intermediaries and blenders of the arts andthe senses wagner as musician is reckoned among painters as poetamong musicians as artist generally among actors; all of them fanaticsfor expression at any cost--i specially mention delacroix the nearestrelated to wagner; all of them great discoverers in the realm of thesublime also of the loathsome and dreadful still greater discoverersin effect in display in the art of the show-shop; all of them talentedfar beyond their genius out and out virtuosi with mysterious accessesto all that seduces allures constrains and upsets; born enemies oflogic and of the straight line hankering after the strange theexotic the monstrous the crooked and the self-contradictory; as mentantaluses of the will plebeian parvenus who knew themselves to beincapable of a noble tempo or of a lento in life and action--thinkof balzac for instance--unrestrained workers almost destroyingthemselves by work; antinomians and rebels in manners ambitious andinsatiable without equilibrium and enjoyment; all of them finallyshattering and sinking down at the christian cross and with rightand reason for who of them would have been sufficiently profound andsufficiently original for an anti-christian philosophy;--on thewhole a boldly daring splendidly overbearing high-flying andaloft-up-dragging class of higher men who had first to teach theircentury--and it is the century of the masses--the conception higherman.... let the german friends of richard wagner advise together as towhether there is anything purely german in the wagnerian art or whetherits distinction does not consist precisely in coming from super-germansources and impulses: in which connection it may not be underratedhow indispensable paris was to the development of his type which thestrength of his instincts made him long to visit at the mostdecisive time--and how the whole style of his proceedings of hisself-apostolate could only perfect itself in sight of the frenchsocialistic original. on a more subtle comparison it will perhaps befound to the honour of richard wagners german nature that he hasacted in everything with more strength daring severity and elevationthan a nineteenth-century frenchman could have done--owing to thecircumstance that we germans are as yet nearer to barbarism than thefrench;--perhaps even the most remarkable creation of richard wagner isnot only at present but for ever inaccessible incomprehensible andinimitable to the whole latter-day latin race: the figure of siegfriedthat very free man who is probably far too free too hard toocheerful too healthy too anti-catholic for the taste of old and mellowcivilized nations. he may even have been a sin against romanticism thisanti-latin siegfried: well wagner atoned amply for this sin in his oldsad days when--anticipating a taste which has meanwhile passed intopolitics--he began with the religious vehemence peculiar to him topreach at least the way to rome if not to walk therein.--thatthese last words may not be misunderstood i will call to my aid a fewpowerful rhymes which will even betray to less delicate ears what imean--what i mean counter to the last wagner and his parsifal music:----is this our mode--from german heart came this vexed ululating fromgerman body this self-lacerating is ours this priestly hand-dilationthis incense-fuming exaltation is ours this faltering fallingshambling this quite uncertain ding-dong-dangling this slynun-ogling ave-hour-bell ringing this wholly false enrapturedheaven-oerspringing--is this our mode--think well!--ye still wait foradmission--for what ye hear is rome--romes faith by intuition!chapter ix. what is noble. every elevation of the type man has hitherto been the work of anaristocratic society and so it will always be--a society believing ina long scale of gradations of rank and differences of worth among humanbeings and requiring slavery in some form or other. without the pathosof distance such as grows out of the incarnated difference of classesout of the constant out-looking and down-looking of the ruling caste onsubordinates and instruments and out of their equally constantpractice of obeying and commanding of keeping down and keeping at adistance--that other more mysterious pathos could never have arisen thelonging for an ever new widening of distance within the soul itselfthe formation of ever higher rarer further more extended morecomprehensive states in short just the elevation of the type manthe continued self-surmounting of man to use a moral formula ina supermoral sense. to be sure one must not resign oneself toany humanitarian illusions about the history of the origin of anaristocratic society that is to say of the preliminary condition forthe elevation of the type man: the truth is hard. let us acknowledgeunprejudicedly how every higher civilization hitherto has originated!men with a still natural nature barbarians in every terrible sense ofthe word men of prey still in possession of unbroken strength of willand desire for power threw themselves upon weaker more moral morepeaceful races perhaps trading or cattle-rearing communities or uponold mellow civilizations in which the final vital force was flickeringout in brilliant fireworks of wit and depravity. at the commencementthe noble caste was always the barbarian caste: their superiority didnot consist first of all in their physical but in their psychicalpower--they were more complete men which at every point also impliesthe same as more complete beasts.. corruption--as the indication that anarchy threatens to break outamong the instincts and that the foundation of the emotions calledlife is convulsed--is something radically different according tothe organization in which it manifests itself. when for instance anaristocracy like that of france at the beginning of the revolutionflung away its privileges with sublime disgust and sacrificed itselfto an excess of its moral sentiments it was corruption:--it was reallyonly the closing act of the corruption which had existed for centuriesby virtue of which that aristocracy had abdicated step by step itslordly prerogatives and lowered itself to a function of royalty inthe end even to its decoration and parade-dress. the essential thinghowever in a good and healthy aristocracy is that it should not regarditself as a function either of the kingship or the commonwealth butas the significance and highest justification thereof--that it shouldtherefore accept with a good conscience the sacrifice of a legionof individuals who for its sake must be suppressed and reduced toimperfect men to slaves and instruments. its fundamental belief mustbe precisely that society is not allowed to exist for its own sake butonly as a foundation and scaffolding by means of which a select classof beings may be able to elevate themselves to their higher duties andin general to a higher existence: like those sun-seeking climbing plantsin java--they are called sipo matador--which encircle an oak solong and so often with their arms until at last high above it butsupported by it they can unfold their tops in the open light andexhibit their happiness.. to refrain mutually from injury from violence from exploitationand put ones will on a par with that of others: this may result in acertain rough sense in good conduct among individuals when the necessaryconditions are given namely the actual similarity of the individualsin amount of force and degree of worth and their co-relation within oneorganization. as soon however as one wished to take this principlemore generally and if possible even as the fundamental principle ofsociety it would immediately disclose what it really is--namely a willto the denial of life a principle of dissolution and decay. here onemust think profoundly to the very basis and resist all sentimentalweakness: life itself is essentially appropriation injury conquestof the strange and weak suppression severity obtrusion ofpeculiar forms incorporation and at the least putting it mildestexploitation;--but why should one for ever use precisely these wordson which for ages a disparaging purpose has been stamped even theorganization within which as was previously supposed theindividuals treat each other as equal--it takes place in everyhealthy aristocracy--must itself if it be a living and not a dyingorganization do all that towards other bodies which the individualswithin it refrain from doing to each other it will have to be theincarnated will to power it will endeavour to grow to gain groundattract to itself and acquire ascendancy--not owing to any morality orimmorality but because it lives and because life is precisely will topower. on no point however is the ordinary consciousness of europeansmore unwilling to be corrected than on this matter people now raveeverywhere even under the guise of science about coming conditions ofsociety in which the exploiting character is to be absent--that soundsto my ears as if they promised to invent a mode of life which shouldrefrain from all organic functions. exploitation does not belong to adepraved or imperfect and primitive society it belongs to the nature ofthe living being as a primary organic function it is a consequenceof the intrinsic will to power which is precisely the will tolife--granting that as a theory this is a novelty--as a reality it isthe fundamental fact of all history let us be so far honest towardsourselves!. in a tour through the many finer and coarser moralities which havehitherto prevailed or still prevail on the earth i found certain traitsrecurring regularly together and connected with one another untilfinally two primary types revealed themselves to me and a radicaldistinction was brought to light. there is master-morality andslave-morality--i would at once add however that in all higher andmixed civilizations there are also attempts at the reconciliation ofthe two moralities but one finds still oftener the confusion andmutual misunderstanding of them indeed sometimes their closejuxtaposition--even in the same man within one soul. the distinctionsof moral values have either originated in a ruling caste pleasantlyconscious of being different from the ruled--or among the ruled classthe slaves and dependents of all sorts. in the first case when it isthe rulers who determine the conception good it is the exalted prouddisposition which is regarded as the distinguishing feature and thatwhich determines the order of rank. the noble type of man separatesfrom himself the beings in whom the opposite of this exalted prouddisposition displays itself he despises them. let it at once be notedthat in this first kind of morality the antithesis good and badmeans practically the same as noble and despicable--the antithesisgood and evil is of a different origin. the cowardly the timid theinsignificant and those thinking merely of narrow utility are despised;moreover also the distrustful with their constrained glances theself-abasing the dog-like kind of men who let themselves be abusedthe mendicant flatterers and above all the liars:--it is a fundamentalbelief of all aristocrats that the common people are untruthful. wetruthful ones--the nobility in ancient greece called themselves. it isobvious that everywhere the designations of moral value were at firstapplied to men; and were only derivatively and at a later period appliedto actions; it is a gross mistake therefore when historians of moralsstart with questions like why have sympathetic actions been praisedthe noble type of man regards himself as a determiner of values; hedoes not require to be approved of; he passes the judgment: what isinjurious to me is injurious in itself; he knows that it is he himselfonly who confers honour on things; he is a creator of values. hehonours whatever he recognizes in himself: such morality equalsself-glorification. in the foreground there is the feeling of plenitudeof power which seeks to overflow the happiness of high tension theconsciousness of a wealth which would fain give and bestow:--the nobleman also helps the unfortunate but not--or scarcely--out of pity butrather from an impulse generated by the super-abundance of power. thenoble man honours in himself the powerful one him also who has powerover himself who knows how to speak and how to keep silence whotakes pleasure in subjecting himself to severity and hardness and hasreverence for all that is severe and hard. wotan placed a hard heart inmy breast says an old scandinavian saga: it is thus rightly expressedfrom the soul of a proud viking. such a type of man is even proud of notbeing made for sympathy; the hero of the saga therefore adds warningly:he who has not a hard heart when young will never have one. the nobleand brave who think thus are the furthest removed from the moralitywhich sees precisely in sympathy or in acting for the good of othersor in desinteressement the characteristic of the moral; faithin oneself pride in oneself a radical enmity and irony towardsselflessness belong as definitely to noble morality as do a carelessscorn and precaution in presence of sympathy and the warm heart.--itis the powerful who know how to honour it is their art their domainfor invention. the profound reverence for age and for tradition--all lawrests on this double reverence--the belief and prejudice in favour ofancestors and unfavourable to newcomers is typical in the morality ofthe powerful; and if reversely men of modern ideas believe almostinstinctively in progress and the future and are more and morelacking in respect for old age the ignoble origin of these ideas hascomplacently betrayed itself thereby. a morality of the ruling classhowever is more especially foreign and irritating to present-day tastein the sternness of its principle that one has duties only to onesequals; that one may act towards beings of a lower rank towards allthat is foreign just as seems good to one or as the heart desiresand in any case beyond good and evil: it is here that sympathy andsimilar sentiments can have a place. the ability and obligation toexercise prolonged gratitude and prolonged revenge--both only within thecircle of equals--artfulness in retaliation raffinement of the ideain friendship a certain necessity to have enemies as outlets for theemotions of envy quarrelsomeness arrogance--in fact in order to bea good friend: all these are typical characteristics of the noblemorality which as has been pointed out is not the morality of modernideas and is therefore at present difficult to realize and also tounearth and disclose.--it is otherwise with the second type of moralityslave-morality. supposing that the abused the oppressed the sufferingthe unemancipated the weary and those uncertain of themselves shouldmoralize what will be the common element in their moral estimatesprobably a pessimistic suspicion with regard to the entire situation ofman will find expression perhaps a condemnation of man together withhis situation. the slave has an unfavourable eye for the virtues of thepowerful; he has a skepticism and distrust a refinement of distrust ofeverything good that is there honoured--he would fain persuade himselfthat the very happiness there is not genuine. on the other hand thosequalities which serve to alleviate the existence of sufferers arebrought into prominence and flooded with light; it is here thatsympathy the kind helping hand the warm heart patience diligencehumility and friendliness attain to honour; for here these are the mostuseful qualities and almost the only means of supporting the burden ofexistence. slave-morality is essentially the morality of utility.here is the seat of the origin of the famous antithesis good andevil:--power and dangerousness are assumed to reside in the evila certain dreadfulness subtlety and strength which do not admit ofbeing despised. according to slave-morality therefore the evil manarouses fear; according to master-morality it is precisely the goodman who arouses fear and seeks to arouse it while the bad man isregarded as the despicable being. the contrast attains its maximum whenin accordance with the logical consequences of slave-morality a shadeof depreciation--it may be slight and well-intentioned--at last attachesitself to the good man of this morality; because according to theservile mode of thought the good man must in any case be the safeman: he is good-natured easily deceived perhaps a little stupid unbonhomme. everywhere that slave-morality gains the ascendancy languageshows a tendency to approximate the significations of the words goodand stupid.--a last fundamental difference: the desire for freedomthe instinct for happiness and the refinements of the feeling of libertybelong as necessarily to slave-morals and morality as artifice andenthusiasm in reverence and devotion are the regular symptoms of anaristocratic mode of thinking and estimating.--hence we can understandwithout further detail why love as a passion--it is our europeanspecialty--must absolutely be of noble origin; as is well known itsinvention is due to the provencal poet-cavaliers those brilliantingenious men of the gai saber to whom europe owes so much andalmost owes itself.. vanity is one of the things which are perhaps most difficult fora noble man to understand: he will be tempted to deny it where anotherkind of man thinks he sees it self-evidently. the problem for him isto represent to his mind beings who seek to arouse a good opinion ofthemselves which they themselves do not possess--and consequently alsodo not deserve--and who yet believe in this good opinionafterwards. this seems to him on the one hand such bad taste and soself-disrespectful and on the other hand so grotesquely unreasonablethat he would like to consider vanity an exception and is doubtfulabout it in most cases when it is spoken of. he will say forinstance: i may be mistaken about my value and on the other handmay nevertheless demand that my value should be acknowledged by othersprecisely as i rate it:--that however is not vanity but self-conceitor in most cases that which is called humility and alsomodesty. or he will even say: for many reasons i can delight inthe good opinion of others perhaps because i love and honour themand rejoice in all their joys perhaps also because their good opinionendorses and strengthens my belief in my own good opinion perhapsbecause the good opinion of others even in cases where i do not shareit is useful to me or gives promise of usefulness:--all this howeveris not vanity. the man of noble character must first bring it homeforcibly to his mind especially with the aid of history that fromtime immemorial in all social strata in any way dependent the ordinaryman was only that which he passed for:--not being at all accustomed tofix values he did not assign even to himself any other value than thatwhich his master assigned to him it is the peculiar right of masters tocreate values. it may be looked upon as the result of an extraordinaryatavism that the ordinary man even at present is still always waitingfor an opinion about himself and then instinctively submitting himselfto it; yet by no means only to a good opinion but also to a badand unjust one think for instance of the greater part of theself-appreciations and self-depreciations which believing women learnfrom their confessors and which in general the believing christianlearns from his church. in fact conformably to the slow rise of thedemocratic social order and its cause the blending of the bloodof masters and slaves the originally noble and rare impulse ofthe masters to assign a value to themselves and to think well ofthemselves will now be more and more encouraged and extended; butit has at all times an older ampler and more radically ingrainedpropensity opposed to it--and in the phenomenon of vanity this olderpropensity overmasters the younger. the vain person rejoices over everygood opinion which he hears about himself quite apart from the pointof view of its usefulness and equally regardless of its truth orfalsehood just as he suffers from every bad opinion: for he subjectshimself to both he feels himself subjected to both by that oldestinstinct of subjection which breaks forth in him.--it is the slavein the vain mans blood the remains of the slaves craftiness--and howmuch of the slave is still left in woman for instance!--whichseeks to seduce to good opinions of itself; it is the slave too whoimmediately afterwards falls prostrate himself before these opinions asthough he had not called them forth.--and to repeat it again: vanity isan atavism.. a species originates and a type becomes established and strong inthe long struggle with essentially constant unfavourable conditions. onthe other hand it is known by the experience of breeders that specieswhich receive super-abundant nourishment and in general a surplus ofprotection and care immediately tend in the most marked way to developvariations and are fertile in prodigies and monstrosities also inmonstrous vices. now look at an aristocratic commonwealth sayan ancient greek polis or venice as a voluntary or involuntarycontrivance for the purpose of rearing human beings; there are there menbeside one another thrown upon their own resources who want to maketheir species prevail chiefly because they must prevail or elserun the terrible danger of being exterminated. the favour thesuper-abundance the protection are there lacking under which variationsare fostered; the species needs itself as species as something whichprecisely by virtue of its hardness its uniformity and simplicity ofstructure can in general prevail and make itself permanent inconstant struggle with its neighbours or with rebellious orrebellion-threatening vassals. the most varied experience teaches itwhat are the qualities to which it principally owes the fact thatit still exists in spite of all gods and men and has hitherto beenvictorious: these qualities it calls virtues and these virtues aloneit develops to maturity. it does so with severity indeed it desiresseverity; every aristocratic morality is intolerant in the educationof youth in the control of women in the marriage customs in therelations of old and young in the penal laws which have an eye onlyfor the degenerating: it counts intolerance itself among the virtuesunder the name of justice. a type with few but very marked featuresa species of severe warlike wisely silent reserved and reticentmen and as such with the most delicate sensibility for the charm andnuances of society is thus established unaffected by the vicissitudesof generations; the constant struggle with uniform unfavourableconditions is as already remarked the cause of a type becomingstable and hard. finally however a happy state of things results theenormous tension is relaxed; there are perhaps no more enemies among theneighbouring peoples and the means of life even of the enjoymentof life are present in superabundance. with one stroke the bond andconstraint of the old discipline severs: it is no longer regarded asnecessary as a condition of existence--if it would continue it canonly do so as a form of luxury as an archaizing taste. variationswhether they be deviations into the higher finer and rarer ordeteriorations and monstrosities appear suddenly on the scene in thegreatest exuberance and splendour; the individual dares to be individualand detach himself. at this turning-point of history there manifestthemselves side by side and often mixed and entangled together amagnificent manifold virgin-forest-like up-growth and up-striving akind of tropical tempo in the rivalry of growth and an extraordinarydecay and self-destruction owing to the savagely opposing and seeminglyexploding egoisms which strive with one another for sun and lightand can no longer assign any limit restraint or forbearance forthemselves by means of the hitherto existing morality. it was thismorality itself which piled up the strength so enormously which bentthe bow in so threatening a manner:--it is now out of date it isgetting out of date. the dangerous and disquieting point has beenreached when the greater more manifold more comprehensive life islived beyond the old morality; the individual stands out and isobliged to have recourse to his own law-giving his own arts andartifices for self-preservation self-elevation and self-deliverance.nothing but new whys nothing but new hows no common formulas anylonger misunderstanding and disregard in league with each other decaydeterioration and the loftiest desires frightfully entangled thegenius of the race overflowing from all the cornucopias of good and bada portentous simultaneousness of spring and autumn full of new charmsand mysteries peculiar to the fresh still inexhausted still unweariedcorruption. danger is again present the mother of morality greatdanger; this time shifted into the individual into the neighbour andfriend into the street into their own child into their own heartinto all the most personal and secret recesses of their desires andvolitions. what will the moral philosophers who appear at this time haveto preach they discover these sharp onlookers and loafers that theend is quickly approaching that everything around them decays andproduces decay that nothing will endure until the day after tomorrowexcept one species of man the incurably mediocre. the mediocre alonehave a prospect of continuing and propagating themselves--they willbe the men of the future the sole survivors; be like them! becomemediocre! is now the only morality which has still a significancewhich still obtains a hearing.--but it is difficult to preach thismorality of mediocrity! it can never avow what it is and what itdesires! it has to talk of moderation and dignity and duty and brotherlylove--it will have difficulty in concealing its irony!. there is an instinct for rank which more than anything else isalready the sign of a high rank; there is a delight in the nuancesof reverence which leads one to infer noble origin and habits. therefinement goodness and loftiness of a soul are put to a perilous testwhen something passes by that is of the highest rank but is notyet protected by the awe of authority from obtrusive touches andincivilities: something that goes its way like a living touchstoneundistinguished undiscovered and tentative perhaps voluntarily veiledand disguised. he whose task and practice it is to investigate soulswill avail himself of many varieties of this very art to determine theultimate value of a soul the unalterable innate order of rank to whichit belongs: he will test it by its instinct for reverence. differenceengendre haine: the vulgarity of many a nature spurts up suddenly likedirty water when any holy vessel any jewel from closed shrines anybook bearing the marks of great destiny is brought before it; whileon the other hand there is an involuntary silence a hesitation of theeye a cessation of all gestures by which it is indicated that a soulfeels the nearness of what is worthiest of respect. the way in which onthe whole the reverence for the bible has hitherto been maintainedin europe is perhaps the best example of discipline and refinement ofmanners which europe owes to christianity: books of such profoundnessand supreme significance require for their protection an externaltyranny of authority in order to acquire the period of thousands ofyears which is necessary to exhaust and unriddle them. much has beenachieved when the sentiment has been at last instilled into the massesthe shallow-pates and the boobies of every kind that they are notallowed to touch everything that there are holy experiences beforewhich they must take off their shoes and keep away the unclean hand--itis almost their highest advance towards humanity. on the contrary inthe so-called cultured classes the believers in modern ideas nothingis perhaps so repulsive as their lack of shame the easy insolence ofeye and hand with which they touch taste and finger everything; and itis possible that even yet there is more relative nobility of taste andmore tact for reverence among the people among the lower classes ofthe people especially among peasants than among the newspaper-readingdemimonde of intellect the cultured class.. it cannot be effaced from a mans soul what his ancestors havepreferably and most constantly done: whether they were perhaps diligenteconomizers attached to a desk and a cash-box modest and citizen-likein their desires modest also in their virtues; or whether they wereaccustomed to commanding from morning till night fond of rude pleasuresand probably of still ruder duties and responsibilities; or whetherfinally at one time or another they have sacrificed old privileges ofbirth and possession in order to live wholly for their faith--for theirgod--as men of an inexorable and sensitive conscience which blushesat every compromise. it is quite impossible for a man not to havethe qualities and predilections of his parents and ancestors in hisconstitution whatever appearances may suggest to the contrary. this isthe problem of race. granted that one knows something of the parentsit is admissible to draw a conclusion about the child: any kindof offensive incontinence any kind of sordid envy or of clumsyself-vaunting--the three things which together have constituted thegenuine plebeian type in all times--such must pass over to the child assurely as bad blood; and with the help of the best education and cultureone will only succeed in deceiving with regard to such heredity.--andwhat else does education and culture try to do nowadays! in our verydemocratic or rather very plebeian age education and culture mustbe essentially the art of deceiving--deceiving with regard to originwith regard to the inherited plebeianism in body and soul. an educatorwho nowadays preached truthfulness above everything else and called outconstantly to his pupils: be true! be natural! show yourselves as youare!--even such a virtuous and sincere ass would learn in a short timeto have recourse to the furca of horace naturam expellere: with whatresults plebeianism usque recurret. footnote: horaces epistlesi. x. .. at the risk of displeasing innocent ears i submit that egoismbelongs to the essence of a noble soul i mean the unalterable beliefthat to a being such as we other beings must naturally be insubjection and have to sacrifice themselves. the noble soul accepts thefact of his egoism without question and also without consciousness ofharshness constraint or arbitrariness therein but rather as somethingthat may have its basis in the primary law of things:--if he sought adesignation for it he would say: it is justice itself. he acknowledgesunder certain circumstances which made him hesitate at first thatthere are other equally privileged ones; as soon as he has settled thisquestion of rank he moves among those equals and equally privilegedones with the same assurance as regards modesty and delicate respectwhich he enjoys in intercourse with himself--in accordance with aninnate heavenly mechanism which all the stars understand. it is anadditional instance of his egoism this artfulness and self-limitationin intercourse with his equals--every star is a similar egoist; hehonours himself in them and in the rights which he concedes to them hehas no doubt that the exchange of honours and rights as the essence ofall intercourse belongs also to the natural condition of things. thenoble soul gives as he takes prompted by the passionate and sensitiveinstinct of requital which is at the root of his nature. the notion offavour has inter pares neither significance nor good repute; theremay be a sublime way of letting gifts as it were light upon one fromabove and of drinking them thirstily like dew-drops; but for thosearts and displays the noble soul has no aptitude. his egoism hinders himhere: in general he looks aloft unwillingly--he looks either forwardhorizontally and deliberately or downwards--he knows that he is on aheight.. one can only truly esteem him who does not look out forhimself.--goethe to rath schlosser.. the chinese have a proverb which mothers even teach their children:siao-sin make thy heart small. this is the essentially fundamentaltendency in latter-day civilizations. i have no doubt that an ancientgreek also would first of all remark the self-dwarfing in us europeansof today--in this respect alone we should immediately be distastefulto him.. what after all is ignobleness--words are vocal symbols forideas; ideas however are more or less definite mental symbolsfor frequently returning and concurring sensations for groups ofsensations. it is not sufficient to use the same words in order tounderstand one another: we must also employ the same words for the samekind of internal experiences we must in the end have experiences incommon. on this account the people of one nation understand one anotherbetter than those belonging to different nations even when they usethe same language; or rather when people have lived long together undersimilar conditions of climate soil danger requirement toil thereoriginates therefrom an entity that understands itself--namely anation. in all souls a like number of frequently recurring experienceshave gained the upper hand over those occurring more rarely: aboutthese matters people understand one another rapidly and always morerapidly--the history of language is the history of a process ofabbreviation; on the basis of this quick comprehension people alwaysunite closer and closer. the greater the danger the greater is theneed of agreeing quickly and readily about what is necessary; not tomisunderstand one another in danger--that is what cannot at all bedispensed with in intercourse. also in all loves and friendships one hasthe experience that nothing of the kind continues when the discoveryhas been made that in using the same words one of the two parties hasfeelings thoughts intuitions wishes or fears different from those ofthe other. the fear of the eternal misunderstanding: that is the goodgenius which so often keeps persons of different sexes from toohasty attachments to which sense and heart prompt them--and not someschopenhauerian genius of the species! whichever groups of sensationswithin a soul awaken most readily begin to speak and give the word ofcommand--these decide as to the general order of rank of its values anddetermine ultimately its list of desirable things. a mans estimates ofvalue betray something of the structure of his soul and wherein itsees its conditions of life its intrinsic needs. supposing now thatnecessity has from all time drawn together only such men as couldexpress similar requirements and similar experiences by similar symbolsit results on the whole that the easy communicability of needwhich implies ultimately the undergoing only of average and commonexperiences must have been the most potent of all the forces whichhave hitherto operated upon mankind. the more similar the more ordinarypeople have always had and are still having the advantage; the moreselect more refined more unique and difficultly comprehensible areliable to stand alone; they succumb to accidents in their isolation andseldom propagate themselves. one must appeal to immense opposing forcesin order to thwart this natural all-too-natural progressus in similethe evolution of man to the similar the ordinary the average thegregarious--to the ignoble--!. the more a psychologist--a born an unavoidable psychologistand soul-diviner--turns his attention to the more select cases andindividuals the greater is his danger of being suffocated by sympathy:he needs sternness and cheerfulness more than any other man. forthe corruption the ruination of higher men of the more unusuallyconstituted souls is in fact the rule: it is dreadful to have such arule always before ones eyes. the manifold torment of the psychologistwho has discovered this ruination who discovers once and thendiscovers almost repeatedly throughout all history this universalinner desperateness of higher men this eternal too late! in everysense--may perhaps one day be the cause of his turning withbitterness against his own lot and of his making an attempt atself-destruction--of his going to ruin himself. one may perceivein almost every psychologist a tell-tale inclination for delightfulintercourse with commonplace and well-ordered men; the fact is therebydisclosed that he always requires healing that he needs a sortof flight and forgetfulness away from what his insight andincisiveness--from what his business--has laid upon his conscience.the fear of his memory is peculiar to him. he is easily silenced by thejudgment of others; he hears with unmoved countenance how people honouradmire love and glorify where he has perceived--or he even concealshis silence by expressly assenting to some plausible opinion. perhapsthe paradox of his situation becomes so dreadful that preciselywhere he has learnt great sympathy together with great contempt themultitude the educated and the visionaries have on their part learntgreat reverence--reverence for great men and marvelous animals forthe sake of whom one blesses and honours the fatherland the earth thedignity of mankind and ones own self to whom one points the youngand in view of whom one educates them. and who knows but in all greatinstances hitherto just the same happened: that the multitude worshippeda god and that the god was only a poor sacrificial animal! successhas always been the greatest liar--and the work itself is a success;the great statesman the conqueror the discoverer are disguised intheir creations until they are unrecognizable; the work of the artistof the philosopher only invents him who has created it is reputedto have created it; the great men as they are reverenced are poorlittle fictions composed afterwards; in the world of historical valuesspurious coinage prevails. those great poets for example such asbyron musset poe leopardi kleist gogol i do not venture to mentionmuch greater names but i have them in my mind as they now appear andwere perhaps obliged to be: men of the moment enthusiastic sensuousand childish light-minded and impulsive in their trust and distrust;with souls in which usually some flaw has to be concealed; often takingrevenge with their works for an internal defilement often seekingforgetfulness in their soaring from a too true memory often lost inthe mud and almost in love with it until they become like thewill-o-the-wisps around the swamps and pretend to be stars--the peoplethen call them idealists--often struggling with protracted disgustwith an ever-reappearing phantom of disbelief which makes them coldand obliges them to languish for gloria and devour faith as it isout of the hands of intoxicated adulators:--what a torment these greatartists are and the so-called higher men in general to him who has oncefound them out! it is thus conceivable that it is just from woman--whois clairvoyant in the world of suffering and also unfortunately eagerto help and save to an extent far beyond her powers--that they havelearnt so readily those outbreaks of boundless devoted sympathy whichthe multitude above all the reverent multitude do not understandand overwhelm with prying and self-gratifying interpretations. thissympathizing invariably deceives itself as to its power; woman wouldlike to believe that love can do everything--it is the superstitionpeculiar to her. alas he who knows the heart finds out how poorhelpless pretentious and blundering even the best and deepest loveis--he finds that it rather destroys than saves!--it is possible thatunder the holy fable and travesty of the life of jesus there is hiddenone of the most painful cases of the martyrdom of knowledge about love:the martyrdom of the most innocent and most craving heart thatnever had enough of any human love that demanded love that demandedinexorably and frantically to be loved and nothing else with terribleoutbursts against those who refused him their love; the story of a poorsoul insatiated and insatiable in love that had to invent hell to sendthither those who would not love him--and that at last enlightenedabout human love had to invent a god who is entire love entirecapacity for love--who takes pity on human love because it is sopaltry so ignorant! he who has such sentiments he who has suchknowledge about love--seeks for death!--but why should one deal withsuch painful matters provided of course that one is not obliged to doso.. the intellectual haughtiness and loathing of every man who hassuffered deeply--it almost determines the order of rank how deeply mencan suffer--the chilling certainty with which he is thoroughly imbuedand coloured that by virtue of his suffering he knows more than theshrewdest and wisest can ever know that he has been familiar withand at home in many distant dreadful worlds of which you knownothing!--this silent intellectual haughtiness of the sufferer thispride of the elect of knowledge of the initiated of the almostsacrificed finds all forms of disguise necessary to protect itself fromcontact with officious and sympathizing hands and in general from allthat is not its equal in suffering. profound suffering makes noble:it separates.--one of the most refined forms of disguise is epicurismalong with a certain ostentatious boldness of taste which takessuffering lightly and puts itself on the defensive against all thatis sorrowful and profound. they are gay men who make use of gaietybecause they are misunderstood on account of it--they wish to bemisunderstood. there are scientific minds who make use of sciencebecause it gives a gay appearance and because scientificness leads tothe conclusion that a person is superficial--they wish to mislead to afalse conclusion. there are free insolent minds which would fain concealand deny that they are broken proud incurable hearts the cynicism ofhamlet--the case of galiani; and occasionally folly itself is the maskof an unfortunate over-assured knowledge.--from which it follows that itis the part of a more refined humanity to have reverence for the maskand not to make use of psychology and curiosity in the wrong place.. that which separates two men most profoundly is a different senseand grade of purity. what does it matter about all their honesty andreciprocal usefulness what does it matter about all their mutualgood-will: the fact still remains--they cannot smell each other! thehighest instinct for purity places him who is affected with it in themost extraordinary and dangerous isolation as a saint: for it is justholiness--the highest spiritualization of the instinct in question. anykind of cognizance of an indescribable excess in the joy of the bathany kind of ardour or thirst which perpetually impels the soul outof night into the morning and out of gloom out of affliction intoclearness brightness depth and refinement:--just as much as such atendency distinguishes--it is a noble tendency--it also separates.--thepity of the saint is pity for the filth of the human all-too-human.and there are grades and heights where pity itself is regarded by him asimpurity as filth.. signs of nobility: never to think of lowering our duties to therank of duties for everybody; to be unwilling to renounce or to shareour responsibilities; to count our prerogatives and the exercise ofthem among our duties.. a man who strives after great things looks upon every one whomhe encounters on his way either as a means of advance or a delay andhindrance--or as a temporary resting-place. his peculiar lofty bountyto his fellow-men is only possible when he attains his elevation anddominates. impatience and the consciousness of being always condemnedto comedy up to that time--for even strife is a comedy and conceals theend as every means does--spoil all intercourse for him; this kind ofman is acquainted with solitude and what is most poisonous in it.. the problem of those who wait.--happy chances are necessary andmany incalculable elements in order that a higher man in whom thesolution of a problem is dormant may yet take action or break forthas one might say--at the right moment. on an average it does not happen;and in all corners of the earth there are waiting ones sitting whohardly know to what extent they are waiting and still less that theywait in vain. occasionally too the waking call comes too late--thechance which gives permission to take action--when their best youthand strength for action have been used up in sitting still; and how manya one just as he sprang up has found with horror that his limbs arebenumbed and his spirits are now too heavy! it is too late he hassaid to himself--and has become self-distrustful and henceforth for everuseless.--in the domain of genius may not the raphael withouthands taking the expression in its widest sense perhaps not be theexception but the rule--perhaps genius is by no means so rare: butrather the five hundred hands which it requires in order to tyrannizeover the greek inserted here the right time--in order to takechance by the forelock!. he who does not wish to see the height of a man looks all themore sharply at what is low in him and in the foreground--and therebybetrays himself.. in all kinds of injury and loss the lower and coarser soul isbetter off than the nobler soul: the dangers of the latter must begreater the probability that it will come to grief and perish is infact immense considering the multiplicity of the conditions of itsexistence.--in a lizard a finger grows again which has been lost; not soin man.--. it is too

praise oneself which is contraryto good taste:--a self-control to be sure which offers excellentopportunity and provocation to constant misunderstanding. to be able toallow oneself this veritable luxury of taste and morality one mustnot live among intellectual imbeciles but rather among men whosemisunderstandings and mistakes amuse by their refinement--or one willhave to pay dearly for it!--he

contemporary with them do not experience suchevents--they live past them. something happens there as in the realm ofstars. the light of the furthest stars is longest in reaching man; andbefore it has arrived man denies--that there are stars there. howmany centuries does a mind require to be understood--that is also astandard one also makes a gradation of rank and an etiquette therewithsuch as is necessary for mind and for star.. here is the prospect free the mind exalted. footnote: goethesfaust part ii act v. the words of dr. marianus.--but there is areverse kind of man who is also upon a height and has also a freeprospect--but looks downwards.. what is noble what does the word noble still mean for usnowadays how does the noble man betray himself how is he recognizedunder this heavy overcast sky of the commencing plebeianism by whicheverything is rendered opaque and leaden--it is not his actions whichestablish his claim--actions are always ambiguous always inscrutable;neither is it his works. one finds nowadays among artists and scholarsplenty of those who betray by their works that a profound longing fornobleness impels them; but this very need of nobleness is radicallydifferent from the needs of the noble soul itself and is in fact theeloquent and dangerous sign of the lack thereof. it is not the worksbut the belief which is here decisive and determines the order ofrank--to employ once more an old religious formula with a new and deepermeaning--it is some fundamental certainty which a noble soul has aboutitself something which is not to be sought is not to be found andperhaps also is not to be lost.--the noble soul has reverence foritself.--. there are men who are unavoidably intellectual let them turnand twist themselves as they will and hold their hands before theirtreacherous eyes--as though the hand were not a betrayer; it alwayscomes out at last that they have something which they hide--namelyintellect. one of the subtlest means of deceiving at least as long aspossible and of successfully representing oneself to be stupiderthan one really is--which in everyday life is often as desirable asan umbrella--is called enthusiasm including what belongs to it forinstance virtue. for as galiani said who was obliged to know it: vertuest enthousiasme.. in the writings of a recluse one always hears something of the echoof the wilderness something of the murmuring tones and timid vigilanceof solitude; in his strongest words even in his cry itself theresounds a new and more dangerous kind of silence of concealment. he whohas sat day and night from years end to years end alone with hissoul in familiar discord and discourse he who has become a cave-bearor a treasure-seeker or a treasure-guardian and dragon in his cave--itmay be a labyrinth but can also be a gold-mine--his ideas themselveseventually acquire a twilight-colour of their own and an odour as muchof the depth as of the mould something uncommunicative and repulsivewhich blows chilly upon every passer-by. the recluse does not believethat a philosopher--supposing that a philosopher has always in the firstplace been a recluse--ever expressed his actual and ultimate opinions inbooks: are not books written precisely to hide what is in us--indeedhe will doubt whether a philosopher can have ultimate and actualopinions at all; whether behind every cave in him there is not and mustnecessarily be a still deeper cave: an ampler stranger richerworld beyond the surface an abyss behind every bottom beneath everyfoundation. every philosophy is a foreground philosophy--this is arecluses verdict: there is something arbitrary in the fact that thephilosopher came to a stand here took a retrospect and looked around;that he here laid his spade aside and did not dig any deeper--thereis also something suspicious in it. every philosophy also conceals aphilosophy; every opinion is also a lurking-place every word is also amask.. every deep thinker is more afraid of being understood than of beingmisunderstood. the latter perhaps wounds his vanity; but the formerwounds his heart his sympathy which always says: ah why would youalso have as hard a time of it as i have. man a complex mendacious artful and inscrutable animal uncannyto the other animals by his artifice and sagacity rather than by hisstrength has invented the good conscience in order finally to enjoy hissoul as something simple; and the whole of morality is a long audaciousfalsification by virtue of which generally enjoyment at the sight ofthe soul becomes possible. from this point of view there is perhaps muchmore in the conception of art than is generally believed.. a philosopher: that is a man who constantly experiences seeshears suspects hopes and dreams extraordinary things; who is struckby his own thoughts as if they came from the outside from above andbelow as a species of events and lightning-flashes peculiar to him; whois perhaps himself a storm pregnant with new lightnings; a portentousman around whom there is always rumbling and mumbling and gaping andsomething uncanny going on. a philosopher: alas a being who oftenruns away from himself is often afraid of himself--but whose curiosityalways makes him come to himself again.. a man who says: i like that i take it for my own and mean toguard and protect it from every one; a man who can conduct a casecarry out a resolution remain true to an opinion keep hold of a womanpunish and overthrow insolence; a man who has his indignation and hissword and to whom the weak the suffering the oppressed and even theanimals willingly submit and naturally belong; in short a man who is amaster by nature--when such a man has sympathy well! that sympathy hasvalue! but of what account is the sympathy of those who suffer! or ofthose even who preach sympathy! there is nowadays throughout almost thewhole of europe a sickly irritability and sensitiveness towards painand also a repulsive irrestrainableness in complaining an effeminizingwhich with the aid of religion and philosophical nonsense seeksto deck itself out as something superior--there is a regular cult ofsuffering. the unmanliness of that which is called sympathy by suchgroups of visionaries is always i believe the first thing thatstrikes the eye.--one must resolutely and radically taboo this latestform of bad taste; and finally i wish people to put the good amuletgai saber gay science in ordinary language on heart and neck asa protection against it.. the olympian vice.--despite the philosopher who as a genuineenglishman tried to bring laughter into bad repute in all thinkingminds--laughing is a bad infirmity of human nature which everythinking mind will strive to overcome hobbes--i would evenallow myself to rank philosophers according to the quality of theirlaughing--up to those who are capable of golden laughter. and supposingthat gods also philosophize which i am strongly inclined to believeowing to many reasons--i have no doubt that they also know how to laughthereby in an overman-like and new fashion--and at the expense of allserious things! gods are fond of ridicule: it seems that they cannotrefrain from laughter even in holy matters.. the genius of the heart as that great mysterious one possessesit the tempter-god and born rat-catcher of consciences whose voice candescend into the nether-world of every soul who neither speaks a wordnor casts a glance in which there may not be some motive or touchof allurement to whose perfection it pertains that he knows how toappear--not as he is but in a guise which acts as an additionalconstraint on his followers to press ever closer to him to follow himmore cordially and thoroughly;--the genius of the heart which imposessilence and attention on everything loud and self-conceited whichsmoothes rough souls and makes them taste a new longing--to lie placidas a mirror that the deep heavens may be reflected in them;--the geniusof the heart which teaches the clumsy and too hasty hand to hesitateand to grasp more delicately; which scents the hidden and forgottentreasure the drop of goodness and sweet spirituality under thick darkice and is a divining-rod for every grain of gold long buried andimprisoned in mud and sand; the genius of the heart from contact withwhich every one goes away richer; not favoured or surprised not asthough gratified and oppressed by the good things of others; but richerin himself newer than before broken up blown upon and sounded by athawing wind; more uncertain perhaps more delicate more fragile morebruised but full of hopes which as yet lack names full of a new willand current full of a new ill-will and counter-current... but what am idoing my friends of whom am i talking to you have i forgotten myselfso far that i have not even told you his name unless it be that youhave already divined of your own accord who this questionable godand spirit is that wishes to be praised in such a manner for as ithappens to every one who from childhood onward has always been on hislegs and in foreign lands i have also encountered on my path manystrange and dangerous spirits; above all however and again and againthe one of whom i have just spoken: in fact no less a personage thanthe god dionysus the great equivocator and tempter to whom as youknow i once offered in all secrecy and reverence my first-fruits--thelast as it seems to me who has offered a sacrifice to him for ihave found no one who could understand what i was then doing. inthe meantime however i have learned much far too much about thephilosophy of this god and as i said from mouth to mouth--i the lastdisciple and initiate of the god dionysus: and perhaps i might at lastbegin to give you my friends as far as i am allowed a little taste ofthis philosophy in a hushed voice as is but seemly: for it has to dowith much that is secret new strange wonderful and uncanny. thevery fact that dionysus is a philosopher and that therefore gods alsophilosophize seems to me a novelty which is not unensnaring and mightperhaps arouse suspicion precisely among philosophers;--among you myfriends there is less to be said against it except that it comes toolate and not at the right time; for as it has been disclosed to me youare loth nowadays to believe in god and gods. it may happen too thatin the frankness of my story i must go further than is agreeable to thestrict usages of your ears certainly the god in question went furthervery much further in such dialogues and was always many paces ahead ofme... indeed if it were allowed i should have to give him accordingto human usage fine ceremonious tides of lustre and merit i shouldhave to extol his courage as investigator and discoverer his fearlesshonesty truthfulness and love of wisdom. but such a god does not knowwhat to do with all that respectable trumpery and pomp. keep that hewould say for thyself and those like thee and whoever else requireit! i--have no reason to cover my nakedness! one suspects that thiskind of divinity and philosopher perhaps lacks shame--he once said:under certain circumstances i love mankind--and referred thereby toariadne who was present; in my opinion man is an agreeable braveinventive animal that has not his equal upon earth he makes his wayeven through all labyrinths. i like man and often think how i canstill further advance him and make him stronger more evil and moreprofound.--stronger more evil and more profound i asked in horror.yes he said again stronger more evil and more profound; also morebeautiful--and thereby the tempter-god smiled with his halcyon smileas though he had just paid some charming compliment. one here sees atonce that it is not only shame that this divinity lacks;--and in generalthere are good grounds for supposing that in some things the gods couldall of them come to us men for instruction. we men are--more human.--. alas! what are you after all my written and painted thoughts! notlong ago you were so variegated young and malicious so full of thornsand secret spices that you made me sneeze and laugh--and now youhave already doffed your novelty and some of you i fear are readyto become truths so immortal do they look so pathetically honest sotedious! and was it ever otherwise what then do we write and paintwe mandarins with chinese brush we immortalisers of things which lendthemselves to writing what are we alone capable of painting alas onlythat which is just about to fade and begins to lose its odour! alasonly exhausted and departing storms and belated yellow sentiments! alasonly birds strayed and fatigued by flight which now let themselves becaptured with the hand--with our hand! we immortalize what cannot

something both ordinary and unusual in all my writings fromthe birth of tragedy to the recently published prelude to aphilosophy of the future: they all contain i have been told snaresand nets for short sighted birds and something that is almost aconstant subtle incitement to an overturning of habitual opinions andof approved customs. what! everything is merely--human--all too humanwith this exclamation my writings are gone through not without acertain dread and mistrust of ethic itself and not without a dispositionto ask the exponent of evil things if those things be not simplymisrepresented. my writings have been termed a school of distrust stillmore of disdain: also and more happily of courage audacity even. andin fact i myself do not believe that anybody ever looked into the worldwith a distrust as deep as mine seeming as i do not simply the timelyadvocate of the devil but to employ theological terms an enemy andchallenger of god; and whosoever has experienced any of the consequencesof such deep distrust anything of the chills and the agonies ofisolation to which such an unqualified difference of standpoint condemnshim endowed with it will also understand how often i must have soughtrelief and self-forgetfulness from any source--through any object ofveneration or enmity of scientific seriousness or wanton lightness;also why i when i could not find what i was in need of had to fashionit for myself counterfeiting it or imagining it and what poet orwriter has ever done anything else and what other purpose can all theart in the world possibly have that which i always stood most in needof in order to effect my cure and self-recovery was faith faith enoughnot to be thus isolated not to look at life from so singular a point ofview--a magic apprehension in eye and mind of relationship andequality a calm confidence in friendship a blindness free fromsuspicion and questioning to two sidedness; a pleasure in externalssuperficialities the near the accessible in all things possessed ofcolor skin and seeming. perhaps i could be fairly reproached with muchart in this regard many fine counterfeitings; for example thatwisely or wilfully i had shut my eyes to schopenhauers blind willtowards ethic at a time when i was already clear sighted enough on thesubject of ethic; likewise that i had deceived myself concerning richardwagners incurable romanticism as if it were a beginning and not anend; likewise concerning the greeks likewise concerning the germans andtheir future--and there may be perhaps a long list of such likewises.granted however that all this were true and with justice urgedagainst me what does it signify what can it signify in regard to howmuch of the self-sustaining capacity how much of reason and higherprotection are embraced in such self-deception--and how much morefalsity is still necessary to me that i may therewith always reassuremyself regarding the luxury of my truth. enough i still live; and lifeis not considered now apart from ethic; it _will_ have deception; itthrives lebt on deception ... but am i not beginning to do all overagain what i have always done i the old immoralist and birdsnarer--talk unmorally ultramorally beyond good and evilthus then have i evolved for myself the free spirits to whom thisdiscouraging-encouraging work under the general title human all toohuman is dedicated. such free spirits do not really exist and neverdid exist. but i stood in need of them as i have pointed out in orderthat some good might be mixed with my evils illness lonelinessstrangeness _acedia_ incapacity: to serve as gay spirits andcomrades with whom one may talk and laugh when one is disposed to talkand laugh and whom one may send to the devil when they grow wearisome.they are some compensation for the lack of friends. that such freespirits can possibly exist that our europe will yet number among hersons of to-morrow or of the day after to-morrow such a brilliant andenthusiastic company alive and palpable and not merely as in my casefantasms and imaginary shades i myself can by no means doubt. i seethem already coming slowly slowly. may it not be that i am doing alittle something to expedite their coming when i describe in advance theinfluences under which i see them evolving and the ways along which theytravelit may be conjectured that a soul in which the type of free spirit canattain maturity and completeness had its decisive and deciding event inthe form of a great emancipation or unbinding and that prior to thatevent it seemed only the more firmly and forever chained to its placeand pillar. what binds strongest what cords seem almost unbreakable inthe case of mortals of a choice and lofty nature they will be those ofduty: that reverence which in youth is most typical that timidity andtenderness in the presence of the traditionally honored and the worthythat gratitude to the soil from which we sprung for the hand thatguided us for the relic before which we were taught to pray--theirsublimest moments will themselves bind these souls most strongly. thegreat liberation comes suddenly to such prisoners like an earthquake:the young soul is all at once shaken torn apart cast forth--itcomprehends not itself what is taking place. an involuntary onwardimpulse rules them with the mastery of command; a will a wish aredeveloped to go forward anywhere at any price; a strong dangerouscuriosity regarding an undiscovered world flames and flashes in alltheir being. better to die than live _here_--so sounds the temptingvoice: and this here this at home constitutes all they havehitherto loved. a sudden dread and distrust of that which they loved aflash of contempt for that which is called their duty a mutinouswilful volcanic-like longing for a far away journey strange scenes andpeople annihilation petrifaction a hatred surmounting love perhaps asacrilegious impulse and look backwards to where they so long prayedand loved perhaps a flush of shame for what they did and at the sametime an exultation at having done it an inner intoxicatingdelightful tremor in which is betrayed the sense of victory--a victoryover what over whom a riddle-like victory fruitful in questioning andwell worth questioning but the _first_ victory for all--such things ofpain and ill belong to the history of the great liberation. and it is atthe same time a malady that can destroy a man this first outbreak ofstrength and will for self-destination self-valuation this will forfree will: and how much illness is forced to the surface in the franticstrivings and singularities with which the freedman the liberated seekshenceforth to attest his mastery over things! he roves fiercely aroundwith an unsatisfied longing and whatever objects he may encounter mustsuffer from the perilous expectancy of his pride; he tears to pieceswhatever attracts him. with a sardonic laugh he overturns whatever hefinds veiled or protected by any reverential awe: he would see whatthese things look like when they are overturned. it is wilfulness anddelight in the wilfulness of it if he now perhaps gives his approvalto that which has heretofore been in ill repute--if in curiosity andexperiment he penetrates stealthily to the most forbidden things. inthe background during all his plunging and roaming--for he is asrestless and aimless in his course as if lost in a wilderness--is theinterrogation mark of a curiosity growing ever more dangerous. can wenot upset every standard and is good perhaps evil and god only aninvention and a subtlety of the devil is everything in the lastresort false and if we are dupes are we not on that very accountdupers also _must_ we not be dupers also such reflections lead andmislead him ever further on ever further away. solitude that dreadgoddess and mater saeva cupidinum encircles and besets him ever morethreatening more violent more heart breaking--but who to-day knowswhat solitude isfrom this morbid solitude from the deserts of such trial years the wayis yet far to that great overflowing certainty and healthiness whichcannot dispense even with sickness as a means and a grappling hook ofknowledge; to that matured freedom of the spirit which is in an equaldegree self mastery and discipline of the heart and gives access tothe path of much and various reflection--to that inner comprehensivenessand self satisfaction of over-richness which precludes all danger thatthe spirit has gone astray even in its own path and is sittingintoxicated in some corner or other; to that overplus of plastichealing imitative and restorative power which is the very sign ofvigorous health that overplus which confers upon the free spirit theperilous prerogative of spending a life in experiment and of runningadventurous risks: the past-master-privilege of the free spirit. in theinterval there may be long years of convalescence years filled withmany hued painfully-bewitching transformations dominated and led to thegoal by a tenacious will for health that is often emboldened to assumethe guise and the disguise of health. there is a middle ground to thiswhich a man of such destiny can not subsequently recall without emotion;he basks in a special fine sun of his own with a feeling of birdlikefreedom birdlike visual power birdlike irrepressibleness a somethingextraneous drittes in which curiosity and delicate disdain haveunited. a free spirit--this refreshing term is grateful in any moodit almost sets one aglow. one lives--no longer in the bonds of love andhate without a yes or no here or there indifferently best pleased toevade to avoid to beat about neither advancing nor retreating. one ishabituated to the bad like a person who all at once sees a fearfulhurly-burly _beneath_ him--and one was the counterpart of him whobothers himself with things that do not concern him. as a matter of factthe free spirit is bothered with mere things--and how manythings--which no longer _concern_ him.a step further in recovery: and the free spirit draws near to lifeagain slowly indeed almost refractorily almost distrustfully. thereis again warmth and mellowness: feeling and fellow feeling acquiredepth lambent airs stir all about him. he almost feels: it seems as ifnow for the first time his eyes are open to things _near_. he is inamaze and sits hushed: for where had he been these near and immediatethings: how changed they seem to him! he looks gratefully back--gratefulfor his wandering his self exile and severity his lookings afar andhis bird flights in the cold heights. how fortunate that he has notlike a sensitive dull home body remained always in the house and athome! he had been beside himself beyond a doubt. now for the firsttime he really sees himself--and what surprises in the process. whathitherto unfelt tremors! yet what joy in the exhaustion the oldsickness the relapses of the convalescent! how it delights himsuffering to sit still to exercise patience to lie in the sun! who sowell as he appreciates the fact that there comes balmy weather even inwinter who delights more in the sunshine athwart the wall they arethe most appreciative creatures in the world and also the most humblethese convalescents and lizards crawling back towards life: there aresome among them who can let no day slip past them without addressingsome song of praise to its retreating light. and speaking seriously itis a fundamental cure for all pessimism the cankerous vice as is wellknown of all idealists and humbugs to become ill in the manner ofthese free spirits to remain ill quite a while and then bit by bit growhealthy--i mean healthier. it is wisdom worldly wisdom to administereven health to oneself for a long time in small doses.about this time it becomes at last possible amid the flash lights of astill unestablished still precarious health for the free the everfreer spirit to begin to read the riddle of that great liberation ariddle which has hitherto lingered obscure well worth questioningalmost impalpable in his memory. if once he hardly dared to ask why soapart so alone renouncing all i loved renouncing respect itself whythis coldness this suspicion this hate for ones very virtues--nowhe dares and asks it loudly already hearing the answer you had tobecome master over yourself master of your own good qualities. formerlythey were your masters: but they should be merely your tools along withother tools. you had to acquire power over your aye and no and learn tohold and withhold them in accordance with your higher aims. you had tograsp the perspective of every representation werthschã¤tzung--thedislocation distortion and the apparent end or teleology of thehorizon besides whatever else appertains to the perspective: also theelement of demerit in its relation to opposing merit and the wholeintellectual cost of every affirmative every negative. you had to findout the _inevitable_ error in every yes and in every no error asinseparable from life life itself as conditioned by the perspective andits inaccuracy. above all you had to see with your own eyes wherethe error is always greatest: there namely where life is littlestnarrowest meanest least developed and yet cannot help looking uponitself as the goal and standard of things and smugly and ignobly andincessantly tearing to tatters all that is highest and greatest andrichest and putting the shreds into the form of questions from thestandpoint of its own well being. you had to see with your own eyes theproblem of classification rangordnung regulation concerning rank andstation and how strength and sweep and reach of perspective wax upwardtogether: you had--enough the free spirit knows henceforward whichyou had it has obeyed and also what it now can do and what it now forthe first time _dare_. ungerechtigkeit literally wrongfulness injustice unrighteousness.accordingly the free spirit works out for itself an answer to thatriddle of its liberation and concludes by generalizing upon itsexperience in the following fashion: what i went through everyone mustgo through in whom any problem is germinated and strives to body itselfforth. the inner power and inevitability of this problem will assertthemselves in due course as in the case of any unsuspectedpregnancy--long before the spirit has seen this problem in its trueaspect and learned to call it by its right name. our destiny exercisesits influence over us even when as yet we have not learned its nature:it is our future that lays down the law to our to-day. granted that itis the problem of classification of which we free spirits may saythis is _our_ problem yet it is only now in the midday of our lifethat we fully appreciate what preparations shifts trials ordealsstages were essential to that problem before it could emerge to ourview and why we had to go through the various and contradictorylongings and satisfactions of body and soul as circumnavigators andadventurers of that inner world called man; as surveyors of thathigher and of that progression that is also calledman--crowding in everywhere almost without fear disdaining nothingmissing nothing testing everything sifting everything and eliminatingthe chance impurities--until at last we could say we free spirits:here--a _new_ problem! here a long ladder on the rungs of which weourselves have rested and risen which we have actually been at times.here is a something higher a something deeper a something below us avastly extensive order ordnung a comparative classificationrangordnung that we perceive: here--_our_ problem! rangordnung: the meaning is the problem of grasping the relativeimportance of things. uebereinander: one over another.to what stage in the development just outlined the present book belongsor is assigned is something that will be hidden from no augur orpsychologist for an instant. but where are there psychologists to-dayin france certainly; in russia perhaps; certainly not in germany.grounds are not wanting to be sure upon which the germans of to-daymay adduce this fact to their credit: unhappily for one who in thismatter is fashioned and mentored in an un-german school! this _german_book which has found its readers in a wide circle of lands andpeoples--it has been some ten years on its rounds--and which must makeits way by means of any musical art and tune that will captivate theforeign ear as well as the native--this book has been read mostindifferently in germany itself and little heeded there: to what is thatdue it requires too much i have been told it addresses itself tomen free from the press of petty obligations it demands fine andtrained perceptions it requires a surplus a surplus of time of thelightness of heaven and of the heart of otium in the most unrestrictedsense: mere good things that we germans of to-day have not got andtherefore cannot give. after so graceful a retort my philosophy bidsme be silent and ask no more questions: at times as the proverb saysone remains a philosopher only because one says--nothing!nice spring .of the first and last things.=chemistry of the notions and the feelings.=--philosophical problems inalmost all their aspects present themselves in the same interrogativeformula now that they did two thousand years ago: how can a thingdevelop out of its antithesis for example the reasonable from thenon-reasonable the animate from the inanimate the logical from theillogical altruism from egoism disinterestedness from greed truthfrom error the metaphysical philosophy formerly steered itself clear ofthis difficulty to such extent as to repudiate the evolution of onething from another and to assign a miraculous origin to what it deemedhighest and best due to the very nature and being of thething-in-itself. the historical philosophy on the other hand whichcan no longer be viewed apart from physical science the youngest of allphilosophical methods discovered experimentally and its results willprobably always be the same that there is no antithesis whateverexcept in the usual exaggerations of popular or metaphysicalcomprehension and that an error of the reason is at the bottom of suchcontradiction. according to its explanation there is strictlyspeaking neither unselfish conduct nor a wholly disinterested point ofview. both are simply sublimations in which the basic element seemsalmost evaporated and betrays its presence only to the keenestobservation. all that we need and that could possibly be given us in thepresent state of development of the sciences is a chemistry of themoral religious aesthetic conceptions and feeling as well as of thoseemotions which we experience in the affairs great and small of societyand civilization and which we are sensible of even in solitude. butwhat if this chemistry established the fact that even in _its_ domainthe most magnificent results were attained with the basest and mostdespised ingredients would many feel disposed to continue suchinvestigations mankind loves to put by the questions of its origin andbeginning: must one not be almost inhuman in order to follow theopposite course=the traditional error of philosophers.=--all philosophers make thecommon mistake of taking contemporary man as their starting point and oftrying through an analysis of him to reach a conclusion. maninvoluntarily presents himself to them as an aeterna veritas as apassive element in every hurly-burly as a fixed standard of things. yeteverything uttered by the philosopher on the subject of man is in thelast resort nothing more than a piece of testimony concerning manduring a very limited period of time. lack of the historical sense isthe traditional defect in all philosophers. many innocently take man inhis most childish state as fashioned through the influence of certainreligious and even of certain political developments as the permanentform under which man must be viewed. they will not learn that man hasevolved that the intellectual faculty itself is an evolutionwhereas some philosophers make the whole cosmos out of this intellectualfaculty. but everything essential in human evolution took place aeonsago long before the four thousand years or so of which we knowanything: during these man may not have changed very much. however thephilosopher ascribes instinct to contemporary man and assumes thatthis is one of the unalterable facts regarding man himself and henceaffords a clue to the understanding of the universe in general. thewhole teleology is so planned that man during the last four thousandyears shall be spoken of as a being existing from all eternity andwith reference to whom everything in the cosmos from its very inceptionis naturally ordered. yet everything evolved: there are no eternal factsas there are no absolute truths. accordingly historical philosophisingis henceforth indispensable and with it honesty of judgment. geworden.=appreciation of simple truths.=--it is the characteristic of anadvanced civilization to set a higher value upon little simple truthsascertained by scientific method than upon the pleasing and magnificenterrors originating in metaphysical and ã¦sthetical epochs and peoples. tobegin with the former are spoken of with contempt as if there could beno question of comparison respecting them so rigid homely prosaic andeven discouraging is the aspect of the first while so beautifuldecorative intoxicating and perhaps beatific appear the last named.nevertheless the hardwon the certain the lasting and therefore thefertile in new knowledge is the higher; to hold fast to it is manly andevinces courage directness endurance. and not only individual men butall mankind will by degrees be uplifted to this manliness when they arefinally habituated to the proper appreciation of tenable enduringknowledge and have lost all faith in inspiration and in the miraculousrevelation of truth. the reverers of forms indeed with their standardsof beauty and taste may have good reason to laugh when the appreciationof little truths and the scientific spirit begin to prevail but thatwill be only because their eyes are not yet opened to the charm of theutmost simplicity of form or because men though reared in the rightlyappreciative spirit will still not be fully permeated by it so thatthey continue unwittingly imitating ancient forms and that ill enoughas anybody does who no longer feels any interest in a thing. formerlythe mind was not brought into play through the medium of exact thought.its serious business lay in the working out of forms and symbols. thathas now changed. any seriousness in symbolism is at present theindication of a deficient education. as our very acts become moreintellectual our tendencies more rational and our judgment forexample as to what seems reasonable is very different from what it wasa hundred years ago: so the forms of our lives grow ever moreintellectual and to the old fashioned eye perhaps uglier but onlybecause it cannot see that the richness of inner rational beauty alwaysspreads and deepens and that the inner rational aspect of all thingsshould now be of more consequence to us than the most beautifulexternality and the most exquisite limning.=astrology and the like.=--it is presumable that the objects of thereligious moral aesthetic and logical notions pertain simply to thesuperficialities of things although man flatters himself with thethought that here at least he is getting to the heart of the cosmos. hedeceives himself because these things have power to make him so happyand so wretched and so he evinces in this respect the same conceitthat characterises astrology. astrology presupposes that the heavenlybodies are regulated in their movements in harmony with the destiny ofmortals: the moral man presupposes that that which concerns himself mostnearly must also be the heart and soul of things.=misconception of dreams.=--in the dream mankind in epochs of crudeprimitive civilization thought they were introduced to a secondsubstantial world: here we have the source of all metaphysic. withoutthe dream men would never have been incited to an analysis of theworld. even the distinction between soul and body is wholly due to theprimitive conception of the dream as also the hypothesis of theembodied soul whence the development of all superstition and alsoprobably the belief in god. the dead still live: for they appear tothe living in dreams. so reasoned mankind at one time and through manythousands of years.=the scientific spirit prevails only partially not wholly.=--thespecialized minutest departments of science are dealt with purelyobjectively. but the general universal sciences considered as a greatbasic unity posit the question--truly a very living question--: to whatpurpose what is the use because of this reference to utility they areas a whole less impersonal than when looked at in their specializedaspects. now in the case of philosophy as forming the apex of thescientific pyramid this question of the utility of knowledge isnecessarily brought very conspicuously forward so that every philosophyhas unconsciously the air of ascribing the highest utility to itself.it is for this reason that all philosophies contain such a great amountof high flying metaphysic and such a shrinking from the seeminginsignificance of the deliverances of physical science: for thesignificance of knowledge in relation to life must be made to appear asgreat as possible. this constitutes the antagonism between thespecialties of science and philosophy. the latter aims as art aims atimparting to life and conduct the utmost depth and significance: in theformer mere knowledge is sought and nothing else--whatever else beincidentally obtained. heretofore there has never been a philosophicalsystem in which philosophy itself was not made the apologist ofknowledge in the abstract. on this point at least each is optimisticand insists that to knowledge the highest utility must be ascribed. theyare all under the tyranny of logic which is from its very natureoptimism.=the discordant element in science.=--philosophy severed itself fromscience when it put the question: what is that knowledge of the worldand of life through which mankind may be made happiest this happenedwhen the socratic school arose: with the standpoint of _happiness_ thearteries of investigating science were compressed too tightly to permitof any circulation of the blood--and are so compressed to-day.=pneumatic explanation of nature.=--metaphysic reads the message ofnature as if it were written purely pneumatically as the church and itslearned ones formerly did where the bible was concerned. it requires agreat deal of expertness to apply to nature the same strict science ofinterpretation that the philologists have devised for all literatureand to apply it for the purpose of a simple direct interpretation ofthe message and at the same time not bring out a double meaning. butas in the case of books and literature errors of exposition are farfrom being completely eliminated and vestiges of allegorical andmystical interpretations are still to be met with in the most cultivatedcircles so where nature is concerned the case is--actually much worse. pneumatic is here used in the sense of spiritual. pneuma being thegreek word in the new testament for the holy spirit.--ed.=metaphysical world.=--it is true there may be a metaphysical world;the absolute possibility of it can scarcely be disputed. we see allthings through the medium of the human head and we cannot well cut offthis head: although there remains the question what part of the worldwould be left after it had been cut off. but that is a purely abstractscientific problem and one not much calculated to give men uneasiness:yet everything that has heretofore made metaphysical assumptionsvaluable fearful or delightful to men all that gave rise to them ispassion error and self deception: the worst systems of knowledge notthe best pin their tenets of belief thereto. when such methods are oncebrought to view as the basis of all existing religions and metaphysicsthey are already discredited. there always remains however thepossibility already conceded: but nothing at all can be made out ofthat to say not a word about letting happiness salvation and life hangupon the threads spun from such a possibility. accordingly nothingcould be predicated of the metaphysical world beyond the fact that it isan elsewhere another sphere inaccessible and incomprehensible tous: it would become a thing of negative properties. even were theexistence of such a world absolutely established it would neverthelessremain incontrovertible that of all kinds of knowledge knowledge ofsuch a world would be of least consequence--of even less consequencethan knowledge of the chemical analysis of water would be to a stormtossed mariner. anderssein.=the harmlessness of metaphysic in the future.=--as soon as religionart and ethics are so understood that a full comprehension of them canbe gained without taking refuge in the postulates of metaphysicalclaptrap at any point in the line of reasoning there will be a completecessation of interest in the purely theoretical problem of the thing initself and the phenomenon. for here too the same truth applies: inreligion art and ethics we are not concerned with the essence of thecosmos. we are in the sphere of pure conception. no presentiment orintuition can carry us any further. with perfect tranquility thequestion of how our conception of the world could differ so sharply fromthe actual world as it is manifest to us will be relegated to thephysiological sciences and to the history of the evolution of ideas andorganisms. wesen der welt an sich.=language as a presumptive science.=--the importance of language in thedevelopment of civilization consists in the fact that by means of itman placed one world his own alongside another a place of leveragethat he thought so firm as to admit of his turning the rest of thecosmos on a pivot that he might master it. in so far as man for ageslooked upon mere ideas and names of things as upon aeternae veritateshe evinced the very pride with which he raised himself above the brute.he really supposed that in language he possessed a knowledge of thecosmos. the language builder was not so modest as to believe that he wasonly giving names to things. on the contrary he thought he embodied thehighest wisdom concerning things in mere words; and in truthlanguage is the first movement in all strivings for wisdom. here tooit is _faith in ascertained truth_ from which the mightiest fountainsof strength have flowed. very tardily--only now--it dawns upon men thatthey have propagated a monstrous error in their belief in language.fortunately it is too late now to arrest and turn back the evolutionaryprocess of the reason which had its inception in this belief. logicitself rests upon assumptions to which nothing in the world of realitycorresponds. for example the correspondence of certain things to oneanother and the identity of those things at different periods of timeare assumptions pure and simple but the science of logic originated inthe positive belief that they were not assumptions at all butestablished facts. it is the same with the science of mathematics whichcertainly would never have come into existence if mankind had known fromthe beginning that in all nature there is no perfectly straight line notrue circle no standard of measurement. glaube an die gefundene wahrheit as distinguished from faith inwhat is taken on trust as truth.=dream and civilization.=--the function of the brain which is mostencroached upon in slumber is the memory; not that it is whollysuspended but it is reduced to a state of imperfection as in primitiveages of mankind was probably the case with everyone whether waking orsleeping. uncontrolled and entangled as it is it perpetually confusesthings as a result of the most trifling similarities yet in the samemental confusion and lack of control the nations invented theirmythologies while nowadays travelers habitually observe how prone thesavage is to forgetfulness how his mind after the least exertion ofmemory begins to wander and lose itself until finally he uttersfalsehood and nonsense from sheer exhaustion. yet in dreams we allresemble this savage. inadequacy of distinction and error of comparisonare the basis of the preposterous things we do and say in dreams sothat when we clearly recall a dream we are startled that so much idiocylurks within us. the absolute distinctness of all dream-images due toimplicit faith in their substantial reality recalls the conditions inwhich earlier mankind were placed for whom hallucinations hadextraordinary vividness entire communities and even entire nationslaboring simultaneously under them. therefore: in sleep and in dream wemake the pilgrimage of early mankind over again.=logic of the dream.=--during sleep the nervous system through variousinner provocatives is in constant agitation. almost all the organs actindependently and vigorously. the blood circulates rapidly. the postureof the sleeper compresses some portions of the body. the coverletsinfluence the sensations in different ways. the stomach carries on thedigestive process and acts upon other organs thereby. the intestines arein motion. the position of the head induces unaccustomed action. thefeet shoeless no longer pressing the ground are the occasion of othersensations of novelty as is indeed the changed garb of the entirebody. all these things following the bustle and change of the dayresult through their novelty in a movement throughout the entiresystem that extends even to the brain functions. thus there are ahundred circumstances to induce perplexity in the mind a questioning asto the cause of this excitation. now the dream is a _seeking andpresenting of reasons_ for these excitations of feeling of the supposedreasons that is to say. thus for example whoever has his feet boundwith two threads will probably dream that a pair of serpents are coiledabout his feet. this is at first a hypothesis then a belief with anaccompanying imaginative picture and the argument: these snakes must bethe _causa_ of those sensations which i the sleeper now have. soreasons the mind of the sleeper. the conditions precedent as thusconjectured become owing to the excitation of the fancy presentrealities. everyone knows from experience how a dreamer will transformone piercing sound for example that of a bell into another of quite adifferent nature say the report of cannon. in his dream he becomesaware first of the effects which he explains by a subsequent hypothesisand becomes persuaded of the purely conjectural nature of the sound. buthow comes it that the mind of the dreamer goes so far astray when thesame mind awake is habitually cautious careful and so conservativein its dealings with hypotheses why does the first plausiblehypothesis of the cause of a sensation gain credit in the dreamingstate for in a dream we look upon that dream as reality that is weaccept our hypotheses as fully established. i have no doubt that as menargue in their dreams to-day mankind argued even in their wakingmoments for thousands of years: the first _causa_ that occurred to themind with reference to anything that stood in need of explanation wasaccepted as the true explanation and served as such. savages show thesame tendency in operation as the reports of travelers agree. in thedream this atavistic relic of humanity manifests its existence withinus for it is the foundation upon which the higher rational facultydeveloped itself and still develops itself in every individual. dreamscarry us back to the earlier stages of human culture and afford us ameans of understanding it more clearly. dream thought comes so easily tous now because we are so thoroughly trained to it through theinterminable stages of evolution during which this fanciful and facileform of theorising has prevailed. to a certain extent the dream is arestorative for the brain which during the day is called upon to meetthe many demands for trained thought made upon it by the conditions of ahigher civilization.--we may if we please become sensible even in ourwaking moments of a condition that is as a door and vestibule todreaming. if we close our eyes the brain immediately conjures up amedley of impressions of light and color apparently a sort of imitationand echo of the impressions forced in upon the brain during its wakingmoments. and now the mind in co-operation with the imaginationtransforms this formless play of light and color into definite figuresmoving groups landscapes. what really takes place is a sort ofreasoning from effect back to cause. as the brain inquires: whence theseimpressions of light and color it posits as the inducing causes of suchlights and colors those shapes and figures. they serve the brain as theoccasions of those lights and colors because the brain when the eyesare open and the senses awake is accustomed to perceiving the cause ofevery impression of light and color made upon it. here again theimagination is continually interposing its images inasmuch as itparticipates in the production of the impressions made through thesenses day by day: and the dream-fancy does exactly the same thing--thatis the presumed cause is determined from the effect and _after_ theeffect: all this too with extraordinary rapidity so that in thismatter as in a matter of jugglery or sleight-of-hand a confusion ofthe mind is produced and an after effect is made to appear asimultaneous action an inverted succession of events even.--fromthese considerations we can see how _late_ strict logical thought thetrue notion of cause and effect must have been in developing since ourintellectual and rational faculties to this very day revert to theseprimitive processes of deduction while practically half our lifetime isspent in the super-inducing conditions.--even the poet the artistascribes to his sentimental and emotional states causes which are notthe true ones. to that extent he is a reminder of early mankind and canaid us in its comprehension.=association.=--all strong feelings are associated with a variety ofallied sentiments and emotions. they stir up the memory at the sametime. when we are under their influence we are reminded of similarstates and we feel a renewal of them within us. thus are formed habitualsuccessions of feelings and notions which at last when they followone another with lightning rapidity are no longer felt as complexitiesbut as unities. in this sense we hear of moral feelings of religiousfeelings as if they were absolute unities. in reality they are streamswith a hundred sources and tributaries. here again the unity of theword speaks nothing for the unity of the thing. miterklingen: to sound simultaneously with.=no within and without in the world.=--as democritus transferred thenotions above and below to limitless space where they are destitute ofmeaning so the philosophers do generally with the idea within andwithout as regards the form and substance wesen und erscheinung ofthe world. what they claim is that through the medium of profoundfeelings one can penetrate deep into the soul of things innre drawclose to the heart of nature. but these feelings are deep only in so faras with them are simultaneously aroused although almost imperceptiblycertain complicated groups of thoughts gedankengruppen which we calldeep: a feeling is deep because we deem the thoughts accompanying itdeep. but deep thought can nevertheless be very widely sundered fromtruth as for instance every metaphysical thought. take from deepfeeling the element of thought blended with it and all that remains is_strength_ of feeling which is no voucher for the validity ofknowledge as intense faith is evidence only of its own intensity andnot of the truth of that in which the faith is felt. kein innen und aussen in der welt: the above translation may seemtoo literal but some dispute has arisen concerning the precise idea theauthor means to convey.=phenomenon and thing-in-itself.=--the philosophers are in the habit ofplacing themselves in front of life and experience--that which they callthe world of phenomena--as if they were standing before a picture thatis unrolled before them in its final completeness. this panorama theythink must be studied in every detail in order to reach some conclusionregarding the object represented by the picture. from effectaccordingly is deduced cause and from cause is deduced theunconditioned. this process is generally looked upon as affording theall sufficient explanation of the world of phenomena. on the other handone must while putting the conception of the metaphysical distinctlyforward as that of the unconditioned and consequently of theunconditioning absolutely deny any connection between the unconditionedof the metaphysical world and the world known to us: so thatthroughout phenomena there is no manifestation of the thing-in-itselfand getting from one to the other is out of the question. thus is leftquite ignored the circumstance that the picture--that which we now calllife and experience--is a gradual evolution is indeed still inprocess of evolution and for that reason should not be regarded as anenduring whole from which any conclusion as to its author theall-sufficient reason could be arrived at or even pronounced out ofthe question. it is because we have for thousands of years looked intothe world with moral aesthetic religious predispositions with blindprejudice passion or fear and surfeited ourselves with indulgence inthe follies of illogical thought that the world has gradually become sowondrously motley frightful significant soulful: it has taken ontints but we have been the colorists: the human intellect upon thefoundation of human needs of human passions has reared all thesephenomena and injected its own erroneous fundamental conceptions intothings. late very late the human intellect checks itself: and now theworld of experience and the thing-in-itself seem to it so severed and soantithetical that it denies the possibility of ones hinging upon theother--or else summons us to surrender our intellect our personal willto the secret and the awe-inspiring in order that thereby we may attaincertainty of certainty hereafter. again there are those who havecombined all the characteristic features of our world ofphenomena--that is the conception of the world which has been formedand inherited through a series of intellectual vagaries--and instead ofholding the intellect responsible for it all have pronounced the verynature of things accountable for the present very sinister aspect of theworld and preached annihilation of existence. through all these viewsand opinions the toilsome steady process of science which now for thefirst time begins to celebrate its greatest triumph in the genesis ofthought will definitely work itself out the result being perhaps tothe following effect: that which we now call the world is the result ofa crowd of errors and fancies which gradually developed in the generalevolution of organic nature have grown together and been transmitted tous as the accumulated treasure of all the past--as the _treasure_ forwhatever is worth anything in our humanity rests upon it. from thisworld of conception it is in the power of science to release us only toa slight extent--and this is all that could be wished--inasmuch as itcannot eradicate the influence of hereditary habits of feeling but itcan light up by degrees the stages of the development of that world ofconception and lift us at least for a time above the whole spectacle.perhaps we may then perceive that the thing-in-itself is a meet subjectfor homeric laughter: that it seemed so much everything indeed andis really a void--void that is to say of meaning.=metaphysical explanation.=--man when he is young prizes metaphysicalexplanations because they make him see matters of the highest import inthings he found disagreeable or contemptible: and if he is not satisfiedwith himself this feeling of dissatisfaction is soothed when he seesthe most hidden world-problem or world-pain in that which he finds sodispleasing in himself. to feel himself more unresponsible and at thesame time to find things dinge more interesting--that is to him thedouble benefit he owes to metaphysics. later indeed he acquiresdistrust of the whole metaphysical method of explaining things: he thenperceives perhaps that those effects could have been attained just aswell and more scientifically by another method: that physical andhistorical explanations would at least have given that feeling offreedom from personal responsibility just as well while interest inlife and its problems would be stimulated perhaps even more.=the fundamental problems of metaphysics.=--if a history of thedevelopment of thought is ever written the following propositionadvanced by a distinguished logician will be illuminated with a newlight: the universal primordial law of the apprehending subjectconsists in the inner necessity of cognizing every object by itself asin its essence a thing unto itself therefore as self-existing andunchanging in short as a substance. even this law which is herecalled primordial is an evolution: it has yet to be shown howgradually this evolution takes place in lower organizations: how thedim mole eyes of such organizations see at first nothing but a blanksameness: how later when the various excitations of desire and aversionmanifest themselves various substances are gradually distinguished buteach with an attribute that is a special relationship to such anorganization. the first step towards the logical is judgment theessence of which according to the best logicians is belief. at thefoundation of all beliefs lie sensations of pleasure or pain in relationto the apprehending subject. a third feeling as the result of twoprior single separate feelings is judgment in its crudest form. weorganic beings are primordially interested by nothing whatever in anything ding except its relation to ourselves with reference to pleasureand pain. between the moments in which we are conscious of thisrelation the states of feeling lie the moments of rest ofnot-feeling: then the world and every thing ding have no interest forus: we observe no change in them as at present a person absorbed insomething does not notice anyone passing by. to plants all things areas a rule at rest eternal every object like itself. from the periodof lower organisms has been handed down to man the belief that there arelike things gleiche dinge: only the trained experience attainedthrough the most advanced science contradicts this postulate. theprimordial belief of all organisms is perhaps that all the rest of theworld is one thing and motionless.--furthest away from this first steptowards the logical is the notion of causation: even to-day we thinkthat all our feelings and doings are at bottom acts of the free will;when the sentient individual contemplates himself he deems everyfeeling every change a something isolated disconnected that is tosay unqualified by any thing; it comes suddenly to the surfaceindependent of anything that went before or came after. we are hungrybut originally we do not know that the organism must be nourished: onthe contrary that feeling seems to manifest itself without reason orpurpose; it stands out by itself and seems quite independent. therefore:the belief in the freedom of the will is a primordial error ofeverything organic as old as the very earliest inward prompting of thelogical faculty; belief in unconditioned substances and in like thingsgleiche dinge is also a primordial and equally ancient error ofeverything organic. inasmuch as all metaphysic has concerned itselfparticularly with substance and with freedom of the will it should bedesignated as the science that deals with the fundamental errors ofmankind as if they were fundamental truths.=number.=--the invention of the laws of number has as its basis theprimordial and prior-prevailing delusion that many like things existalthough in point of fact there is no such thing is a duplicate orthat at least there are things but there is no thing. theassumption of plurality always presupposes that _something_ exists whichmanifests itself repeatedly but just here is where the delusionprevails; in this very matter we feign realities unities that have noexistence. our feelings notions of space and time are false for theylead when duly tested to logical contradictions. in all scientificdemonstrations we always unavoidably base our calculation upon somefalse standards of duration or measurement but as these standards areat least _constant_ as for example our notions of time and space theresults arrived at by science possess absolute accuracy and certainty intheir relationship to one another: one can keep on building uponthem--until is reached that final limit at which the erroneousfundamental conceptions the invariable breakdown come into conflictwith the results established--as for example in the case of the atomictheory. here we always find ourselves obliged to give credence to athing or material substratum that is set in motion although at thesame time the whole scientific programme has had as its aim theresolving of everything material into motions themselves: here againwe distinguish with our feeling that which does the moving and thatwhich is moved and we never get out of this circle because thebelief in things has been from time immemorial rooted in ournature.--when kant says the intellect does not derive its laws fromnature but dictates them to her he states the full truth as regardsthe _idea of nature_ which we form nature = world as notion that isas error but which is merely the synthesis of a host of errors of theintellect. to a world not the outcome of our conception the laws ofnumber are wholly inapplicable: such laws are valid only in the world ofmankind. wir scheiden auch hier noch mit unserer empfindung bewegendes undbewegtes. glaube an dinge.=some backward steps.=--one very forward step in education is taken whenman emerges from his superstitious and religious ideas and fears andfor instance no longer believes in the dear little angels or inoriginal sin and has stopped talking about the salvation of the soul:when he has taken this step to freedom he has nevertheless through theutmost exertion of his mental power to overcome metaphysics. then abackward movement is necessary: he must appreciate the historicaljustification and to an equal extent the psychological considerationsin such a movement. he must understand that the greatest advances madeby mankind have resulted from such a course and that without this verybackward movement the highest achievements of man hitherto would havebeen impossible.--with regard to philosophical metaphysics i see evermore and more who have arrived at the negative goal that all positivemetaphysic is a delusion but as yet very few who go a few stepsbackward: one should look out over the last rungs of the ladder but nottry to stand on them that is to say. the most advanced as yet go onlyfar enough to free themselves from metaphysic and look back at it withan air of superiority: whereas here no less than in the hippodrome itis necessary to turn around in order to reach the end of the course.=presumable nature of the victory of doubt.=--let us assume for amoment the validity of the skeptical standpoint: granted that there isno metaphysical world and that all the metaphysical explanations of theonly world we know are useless to us how would we then contemplate menand things menschen und dinge. this can be thought out and it isworth while doing so even if the question whether anything metaphysicalhas ever been demonstrated by or through kant and schopenhauer be putaltogether aside. for it is to all appearances highly probable thatmen on this point will be in the mass skeptical. the question thusbecomes: what sort of a notion will human society under the influenceof such a state of mind form of itself perhaps the _scientificdemonstration_ of any metaphysical world is now so difficult thatmankind will never be free from a distrust of it. and when there isformed a feeling of distrust of metaphysics the results are in themass the same as if metaphysics were refuted altogether and _could_ nolonger be believed. in both cases the historical question with regardto an unmetaphysical disposition in mankind remains the same.=disbelief in the monumentum aere perennius.=--a decideddisadvantage attending the termination of metaphysical modes ofthought is that the individual fixes his mind too attentively upon hisown brief lifetime and feels no strong inducement to aid in thefoundation of institutions capable of enduring for centuries: he wisheshimself to gather the fruit from the tree that he plants andconsequently he no longer plants those trees which require centuries ofconstant cultivation and are destined to afford shade to generationafter generation in the future. for metaphysical views inspire thebelief that in them is afforded the final sure foundation upon whichhenceforth the whole future of mankind may rest and be built up: theindividual promotes his own salvation; when for example he builds achurch or a monastery he is of opinion that he is doing something forthe salvation of his immortal soul:--can science as well inspire suchfaith in the efficacy of her results in actual fact science requiresdoubt and distrust as her surest auxiliaries; nevertheless the sum ofthe irresistible that is all the onslaughts of skepticism all thedisintegrating effects of surviving truths can easily become so greatas for instance in the case of hygienic science as to inspire thedetermination to build eternal works upon it. at present the contrastbetween our excitated ephemeral existence and the tranquil repose ofmetaphysical epochs is too great because both are as yet in too closejuxtaposition. the individual man himself now goes through too manystages of inner and outer evolution for him to venture to make a planeven for his life time alone. a perfectly modern man indeed who wantsto build himself a house feels as if he were walling himself up alive ina mausoleum. monument more enduring than brass: horace odes iii:xxx.=age of comparison.=--the less men are bound by tradition the greateris the inner activity of motives the greater correspondingly theouter restlessness the promiscuous flow of humanity the polyphony ofstrivings. who now feels any great impulse to establish himself and hisposterity in a particular place for whom moreover does there existat present any strong tie as all the methods of the arts were copiedfrom one another so were all the methods and advancements of moralcodes of manners of civilizations.--such an age derives itssignificance from the fact that in it the various ideas codes mannersand civilizations can be compared and experienced side by side; whichwas impossible at an earlier period in view of the localised nature ofthe rule of every civilization corresponding to the limitation of allartistic effects by time and place. to-day the growth of the aestheticfeeling is decided owing to the great number of artistic forms whichoffer themselves for comparison. the majority--those that are condemnedby the method of comparison--will be allowed to die out. in the same waythere is to-day taking place a selection of the forms and customs of thehigher morality which can result only in the extinction of the vulgarmoralities. this is the age of comparison! that is its glory--but alsoits pain. let us not however shrink from this pain. rather would wecomprehend the nature of the task imposed upon us by our age asadequately as we can: posterity will bless us for doing so--a posteritythat knows itself to be developed through and above the narrow earlyrace-civilizations as well as the culture-civilization of comparisonbut yet looks gratefully back upon both as venerable monuments ofantiquity.=possibility of progress.=--when a master of the old civilization denalten cultur vows to hold no more discussion with men who believe inprogress he is quite right. for the old civilization has itsgreatness and its advantages behind it and historic training forces oneto acknowledge that it can never again acquire vigor: only intolerablestupidity or equally intolerable fanaticism could fail to perceive thisfact. but men may consciously determine to evolve to a new civilizationwhere formerly they evolved unconsciously and accidentally. they can nowdevise better conditions for the advancement of mankind for theirnourishment training and education they can administer the earth as aneconomic power and particularly compare the capacities of men andselect them accordingly. this new conscious civilization is killing theother which on the whole has led but an unreflective animal and plantlife: it is also destroying the doubt of progress itself--progress ispossible. i mean: it is hasty and almost unreflective to assume thatprogress must _necessarily_ take place: but how can it be doubted thatprogress is possible on the other hand progress in the sense and alongthe lines of the old civilization is not even conceivable. if romanticfantasy employs the word progress in connection with certain aims andends identical with those of the circumscribed primitive nationalcivilizations the picture presented of progress is always borrowed fromthe past. the idea and the image of progress thus formed are quitewithout originality. cultur culture civilisation etc. but there is no exact englishequivalent.=private ethics and world ethics.=--since the extinction of the beliefthat a god guides the general destiny of the world and notwithstandingall the contortions and windings of the path of mankind leads itgloriously forward men must shape oecumenical world-embracing ends forthemselves. the older ethics namely kants required of the individualsuch a course of conduct as he wishes all men to follow. this evincesmuch simplicity--as if any individual could determine off hand whatcourse of conduct would conduce to the welfare of humanity and whatcourse of conduct is preã«minently desirable! this is a theory like thatof freedom of competition which takes it for granted that the generalharmony of things _must_ prevail of itself in accordance with someinherent law of betterment or amelioration. it may be that a latercontemplation of the needs of mankind will reveal that it is by no meansdesirable that all men should regulate their conduct according to thesame principle; it may be best from the standpoint of certain ends yetto be attained that men during long periods should regulate theirconduct with reference to special and even in certain circumstancesevil objects. at any rate if mankind is not to be led astray by such auniversal rule of conduct it behooves it to attain a _knowledge of thecondition of culture_ that will serve as a scientific standard ofcomparison in connection with cosmical ends. herein is comprised thetremendous mission of the great spirits of the next century.=reaction as progress.=--occasionally harsh powerful impetuous yetnevertheless backward spirits appear who try to conjure back some pastera in the history of mankind: they serve as evidence that the newtendencies which they oppose are not yet potent enough that there issomething lacking in them: otherwise they the tendencies would betterwithstand the effects of this conjuring back process. thus luthersreformation shows that in his century all the impulses to freedom of thespirit were still uncertain lacking in vigor and immature. sciencecould not yet rear her head. indeed the whole renaissance appears but asan early spring smothered in snow. but even in the present centuryschopenhauers metaphysic shows that the scientific spirit is not yetpowerful enough: for the whole mediaeval christian world-standpointweltbetrachtung and conception of man mensch-empfindung onceagain notwithstanding the slowly wrought destruction of all christiandogma celebrated a resurrection in schopenhauers doctrine. there ismuch science in his teaching although the science does not dominatebut instead of it the old trite metaphysical necessity. it is oneof the greatest and most priceless advantages of schopenhauers teachingthat by it our feelings are temporarily forced back to those old humanand cosmical standpoints to which no other path could conduct us soeasily. the gain for history and justice is very great. i believe thatwithout schopenhauers aid it would be no easy matter for anyone now todo justice to christianity and its asiatic relatives--a thing impossibleas regards the christianity that still survives. after according thisgreat triumph to justice after we have corrected in so essential arespect the historical point of view which the age of learning broughtwith it we may begin to bear still farther onward the banner ofenlightenment--a banner bearing the three names: petrarch erasmusvoltaire. we have taken a forward step out of reaction. literally man-feeling or human outlook.=a substitute for religion.=--it is supposed to be a recommendation forphilosophy to say of it that it provides the people with a substitutefor religion. and in fact the training of the intellect doesnecessitate the convenient laying out of the track of thought since thetransition from religion by way of science entails a powerful perilousleap--something that should be advised against. with thisqualification the recommendation referred to is a just one. at the sametime it should be further explained that the needs which religionsatisfies and which science must now satisfy are not immutable. eventhey can be diminished and uprooted. think for instance of thechristian soul-need the sighs over ones inner corruption the anxietyregarding salvation--all notions that arise simply out of errors of thereason and require no satisfaction at all but annihilation. aphilosophy can either so affect these needs as to appease them or elseput them aside altogether for they are acquired circumscribed needsbased upon hypotheses which those of science explode. here for thepurpose of affording the means of transition for the sake of lighteningthe spirit overburdened with feeling art can be employed to far betterpurpose as these hypotheses receive far less support from art than froma metaphysical philosophy. then from art it is easier to go over to areally emancipating philosophical science.=discredited words.=--away with the disgustingly over-used wordsoptimism and pessimism! for the occasion for using them grows dailyless; only drivelers now find them indispensably necessary. what earthlyreason could anyone have for being an optimist unless he had a god todefend who _must_ have created the best of all possible worlds since heis himself all goodness and perfection--but what thinking man has nowany need for the hypothesis that there is a god--there is also nooccasion whatever for a pessimistic confession of faith unless one hasa personal interest in denouncing the advocate of god the theologian orthe theological philosopher and maintaining the counter propositionthat evil reigns that wretchedness is more potent than joy that theworld is a piece of botch work that phenomenon erscheinung is but themanifestation of some evil spirit. but who bothers his head about thetheologians any more--except the theologians themselves apart from alltheology and its antagonism it is manifest that the world is neithergood nor bad to say nothing about its being the best or the worst andthat these ideas of good and bad have significance only in relationto men indeed are without significance at all in view of the sense inwhich they are usually employed. the contemptuous and the eulogisticpoint of view must in every case be repudiated.=intoxicated by the perfume of flowers.=--the ship of humanity it isthought acquires an ever deeper draught the more it is laden. it isbelieved that the more profoundly man thinks the more exquisitely hefeels the higher the standard he sets for himself the greater hisdistance from the other animals--the more he appears as a geniusgenie among animals--the nearer he gets to the true nature of theworld and to comprehension thereof: this indeed he really does throughscience but he thinks he does it far more adequately through hisreligions and arts. these are certainly a blossoming of the world butnot therefore _nearer the roots of the world_ than is the stalk. onecannot learn best from it the nature of the world although nearlyeveryone thinks so. _error_ has made men so deep sensitive andimaginative in order to bring forth such flowers as religions and arts.pure apprehension would be unable to do that. whoever should disclose tous the essence of the world would be undeceiving us most cruelly. notthe world as thing-in-itself but the world as idea as error isrich in portent deep wonderful carrying happiness and unhappiness inits womb. this result leads to a philosophy of world negation: which atany rate can be as well combined with a practical world affirmation aswith its opposite. vorstellung: this word sometimes corresponds to the english wordidea at others to conception or notion.=evil habits in reaching conclusions.=--the most usual erroneousconclusions of men are these: a thing exists therefore it is right:here from capacity to live is deduced fitness from fitness is deducedjustification. so also: an opinion gives happiness therefore it is thetrue one its effect is good therefore it is itself good and true. hereis predicated of the effect that it gives happiness that it is good inthe sense of utility and there is likewise predicated of the cause thatit is good but good in the sense of logical validity. conversely theproposition would run: a thing cannot attain success cannotmaintain itself therefore it is evil: a belief troubles the believeroccasions pain therefore it is false. the free spirit who is sensibleof the defect in this method of reaching conclusions and has had tosuffer its consequences often succumbs to the temptation to come to thevery opposite conclusions which in general are of course equallyerroneous: a thing cannot maintain itself: therefore it is good; abelief is troublesome therefore it is true. sache thing but not in the sense of ding. sache is of veryindefinite application res.=the illogical is necessary.=--among the things which can bring athinker to distraction is the knowledge that the illogical is necessaryto mankind and that from the illogical springs much that is good. theillogical is so imbedded in the passions in language in art inreligion and above all in everything that imparts value to life thatit cannot be taken away without irreparably injuring those beautifulthings. only men of the utmost simplicity can believe that the natureman knows can be changed into a purely logical nature. yet were theresteps affording approach to this goal how utterly everything would belost on the way! even the most rational man needs nature again fromtime to time that is his illogical fundamental relationgrundstellung to all things.=being unjust is essential.=--all judgments of the value of life areillogically developed and therefore unjust. the vice of the judgmentconsists first in the way in which the subject matter comes underobservation that is very incompletely; secondly in the way in whichthe total is summed up; and thirdly in the fact that each single itemin the totality of the subject matter is itself the result of defectiveperception and this from absolute necessity. no practical knowledge ofa man for example stood he never so near to us can be complete--sothat we could have a logical right to form a total estimate of him; allestimates are summary and must be so. then the standard by which wemeasure our being is not an immutable quantity; we have moods andvariations and yet we should know ourselves as an invariable standardbefore we undertake to establish the nature of the relation of any thingsache to ourselves. perhaps it will follow from all this that oneshould form no judgments whatever; if one could but merely _live_without having to form estimates without aversion and withoutpartiality!--for everything most abhorred is closely connected with anestimate as well as every strongest partiality. an inclination towardsa thing or from a thing without an accompanying feeling that thebeneficial is desired and the pernicious contemned an inclinationwithout a sort of experiential estimation of the desirability of an enddoes not exist in man. we are primordially illogical and hence unjustbeings _and can recognise this fact_: this is one of the greatest andmost baffling discords of existence.=error respecting living for the sake of living essential.=--everybelief in the value and worthiness of life rests upon defectivethinking; it is for this reason alone possible that sympathy with thegeneral life and suffering of mankind is so imperfectly developed in theindividual. even exceptional men who can think beyond their ownpersonalities do not have this general life in view but isolatedportions of it. if one is capable of fixing his observation uponexceptional cases i mean upon highly endowed individuals and puresouled beings if their development is taken as the true end ofworld-evolution and if joy be felt in their existence then it ispossible to believe in the value of life because in that case the restof humanity is overlooked: hence we have here defective thinking. sotoo it is even if all mankind be taken into consideration and onespecies only of impulses the less egoistic brought under review andthose in consideration of the other impulses exalted: then somethingcould still be hoped of mankind in the mass and to that extent therecould exist belief in the value of life: here again as a result ofdefective thinking. whatever attitude thus one may assume one is asa result of this attitude an exception among mankind. now the greatmajority of mankind endure life without any great protest and believeto this extent in the value of existence but that is because eachindividual decides and determines alone and never comes out of his ownpersonality like these exceptions: everything outside of the personalhas no existence for them or at the utmost is observed as but a faintshadow. consequently the value of life for the generality of mankindconsists simply in the fact that the individual attaches more importanceto himself than he does to the world. the great lack of imagination fromwhich he suffers is responsible for his inability to enter into thefeelings of beings other than himself and hence his sympathy with theirfate and suffering is of the slightest possible description. on theother hand whosoever really _could_ sympathise necessarily doubts thevalue of life; were it possible for him to sum up and to feel in himselfthe total consciousness of mankind he would collapse with a maledictionagainst existence--for mankind is in the mass without a goal andhence man cannot find in the contemplation of his whole courseanything to serve him as a mainstay and a comfort but rather a reasonto despair. if he looks beyond the things that immediately engage him tothe final aimlessness of humanity his own conduct assumes in his eyesthe character of a frittering away. to feel oneself however ashumanity not alone as an individual frittered away exactly as we seethe stray leaves frittered away by nature is a feeling transcending allfeeling. but who is capable of it only a poet certainly: and poetsalways know how to console themselves.=for tranquility.=--but will not our philosophy become thus a tragedywill not truth prove the enemy of life of betterment a question seemsto weigh upon our tongue and yet will not put itself into words: whetherone _can_ knowingly remain in the domain of the untruthful or if one_must_ whether then death would not be preferable for there is nolonger any ought sollen morality; so far as it is involved oughtis through our point of view as utterly annihilated as religion. ourknowledge can permit only pleasure and pain benefit and injury tosubsist as motives. but how can these motives be distinguished from thedesire for truth even they rest upon error in so far as alreadystated partiality and dislike and their very inaccurate estimatespalpably modify our pleasure and our pain. the whole of human life isdeeply involved in _untruth_. the individual cannot extricate it fromthis pit without thereby fundamentally clashing with his whole pastwithout finding his present motives of conduct as that of honorillegitimate and without opposing scorn and contempt to the ambitionswhich prompt one to have regard for the future and for ones happinessin the future. is it true does there then remain but one way ofthinking which as a personal consequence brings in its train despairand as a theoretical consequence brings in its train a philosophy ofdecay disintegration self annihilation i believe the decidinginfluence as regards the after-effect of knowledge will be the_temperament_ of a man; i can in addition to this after-effect justmentioned suppose another by means of which a much simpler life andone freer from disturbances than the present could be lived; so that atfirst the old motives of vehement passion might still have strengthowing to hereditary habit but they would gradually grow weaker underthe influence of purifying knowledge. a man would live at last bothamong men and unto himself as in the natural state without praisereproach competition feasting ones eyes as if it were a play uponmuch that formerly inspired dread. one would be rid of the strenuouselement and would no longer feel the goad of the reflection that man isnot even as much as nature nor more than nature. to be sure thisrequires as already stated a good temperament a fortified gentle andnaturally cheerful soul a disposition that has no need to be on itsguard against its own eccentricities and sudden outbreaks and that inits utterances manifests neither sullenness nor a snarling tone--thosefamiliar disagreeable characteristics of old dogs and old men that havebeen a long time chained up. rather must a man from whom the ordinarybondages of life have fallen away to so great an extent so do that heonly lives on in order to grow continually in knowledge and to learn toresign without envy and without disappointment much yes nearlyeverything that has value in the eyes of men. he must be content withsuch a free fearless soaring above men manners laws and traditionalestimates of things as the most desirable of all situations. he willfreely share the joy of being in such a situation and he has perhapsnothing else to share--in which renunciation and self-denial really mostconsist. but if more is asked of him he will with a benevolent shakeof the head refer to his brother the free man of fact and willperhaps not dissemble a little contempt: for as regards his freedomthereby hangs a tale. den mit dessen freiheit hat es eine eigene bewandtniss.history of the moral feelings.=advantages of psychological observation.=--that reflection regardingthe human all-too-human--or as the learned jargon is: psychologicalobservation--is among the means whereby the burden of life can be madelighter that practice in this art affords presence of mind in difficultsituations and entertainment amid a wearisome environment aye thatmaxims may be culled in the thorniest and least pleasing paths of lifeand invigoration thereby obtained: this much was believed was known--informer centuries. why was this forgotten in our own century duringwhich at least in germany yes in europe poverty as regardspsychological observation would have been manifest in many ways hadthere been anyone to whom this poverty could have manifested itself. notonly in the novel in the romance in philosophical standpoints--theseare the works of exceptional men; still more in the state of opinionregarding public events and personages; above all in general societywhich says much about men but nothing whatever about man there istotally lacking the art of psychological analysis and synthesis. but whyis the richest and most harmless source of entertainment thus allowed torun to waste why is the greatest master of the psychological maxim nolonger read--for with no exaggeration whatever be it said: theeducated person in europe who has read la rochefoucauld and hisintellectual and artistic affinities is very hard to find; still harderthe person who knows them and does not disparage them. apparently toothis unusual reader takes far less pleasure in them than the formadopted by these artists should afford him: for the subtlest mind cannotadequately appreciate the art of maxim-making unless it has had trainingin it unless it has competed in it. without such practicalacquaintance one is apt to look upon this making and forming as a mucheasier thing than it really is; one is not keenly enough alive to thefelicity and the charm of success. hence present day readers of maximshave but a moderate tempered pleasure in them scarcely indeed a trueperception of their merit so that their experiences are about the sameas those of the average beholder of cameos: people who praise becausethey cannot appreciate and are very ready to admire and still readierto turn away.=objection.=--or is there a counter-proposition to the dictum thatpsychological observation is one of the means of consoling lighteningcharming existence have enough of the unpleasant effects of this artbeen experienced to justify the person striving for culture in turninghis regard away from it in all truth a certain blind faith in thegoodness of human nature an implanted distaste for any disparagement ofhuman concerns a sort of shamefacedness at the nakedness of the soulmay be far more desirable things in the general happiness of a man thanthis only occasionally advantageous quality of psychologicalsharpsightedness; and perhaps belief in the good in virtuous men andactions in a plenitude of disinterested benevolence has been moreproductive of good in the world of men in so far as it has made men lessdistrustful. if plutarchs heroes are enthusiastically imitated and areluctance is experienced to looking too critically into the motives oftheir actions not the knowledge but the welfare of human society ispromoted thereby: psychological error and above all obtuseness in regardto it help human nature forward whereas knowledge of the truth is morepromoted by means of the stimulating strength of a hypothesis; as larochefoucauld in the first edition of his sentences and moral maximshas expressed it: what the world calls virtue is ordinarily but aphantom created by the passions and to which we give a good name inorder to do whatever we please with impunity. la rochefoucauld andthose other french masters of soul-searching to the number of whom haslately been added a german the author of psychological observationsare like expert marksmen who again and again hit the black spot--but itis the black spot in human nature. their art inspires amazement butfinally some spectator inspired not by the scientific spirit but by ahumanitarian feeling execrates an art that seems to implant in the soula taste for belittling and impeaching mankind.=nevertheless.=--the matter therefore as regards pro and con standsthus: in the present state of philosophy an awakening of the moralobservation is essential. the repulsive aspect of psychologicaldissection with the knife and tweezers entailed by the process can nolonger be spared humanity. such is the imperative duty of any sciencethat investigates the origin and history of the so-called moral feelingsand which in its progress is called upon to posit and to solveadvanced social problems:--the older philosophy does not recognize thenewer at all and through paltry evasions has always gone astray in theinvestigation of the origin and history of human estimateswerthschã¤tzungen. with what results may now be very clearly perceivedsince it has been shown by many examples how the errors of the greatestphilosophers have their origin in a false explanation of certain humanactions and feelings; how upon the foundation of an erroneous analysisfor example of the so called disinterested actions a false ethic isreared to support which religion and like mythological monstrositiesare called in until finally the shades of these troubled spiritscollapse in physics and in the comprehensive world point of view. but ifit be established that superficiality of psychological observation hasheretofore set the most dangerous snares for human judgment anddeduction and will continue to do so all the greater need is there ofthat steady continuance of labor that never wearies putting stone uponstone little stone upon little stone; all the greater need is there ofa courage that is not ashamed of such humble labor and that will opposepersistence to all contempt. it is finally also true that countlesssingle observations concerning the human all-too-human have beenfirst made and uttered in circles accustomed not to furnish matter forscientific knowledge but for intellectual pleasure-seeking; and theoriginal home atmosphere--a very seductive atmosphere--of the moralmaxim has almost inextricably interpenetrated the entire species sothat the scientific man involuntarily manifests a sort of mistrust ofthis species and of its seriousness. but it is sufficient to point tothe consequences: for already it is becoming evident that events of themost portentous nature are developing in the domain of psychologicalobservation. what is the leading conclusion arrived at by one of thesubtlest and calmest of thinkers the author of the work concerning theorigin of the moral feelings as a result of his thorough and incisiveanalysis of human conduct the moral man he says stands no nearerthe knowable metaphysical world than the physical man. thisdictum grown hard and cutting beneath the hammer-blow of historicalknowledge can some day perhaps in some future or other serve as theaxe that will be laid to the root of the metaphysical necessities ofmen--whether more to the blessing than to the banning of universal wellbeing who can say--but in any event a dictum fraught with the mostmomentous consequences fruitful and fearful at once and confrontingthe world in the two faced way characteristic of all great facts. der moralische mensch sagt er steht der intelligiblenmetaphysischen welt nicht nã¤her als der physische mensch.=to what extent useful.=--therefore whether psychological observationis more an advantage than a disadvantage to mankind may always remainundetermined: but there is no doubt that it is necessary becausescience can no longer dispense with it. science however recognizes noconsiderations of ultimate goals or ends any more than nature does; butas the latter duly matures things of the highest fitness for certainends without any intention of doing it so will true science doing withideas what nature does with matter promote the purposes and thewelfare of humanity as occasion may afford and in many ways andattain fitness to ends--but likewise without having intended it. als die nachahmung der natur in begriffen literally: as thecounterfeit of nature in regard to ideas.he to whom the atmospheric conditions of such a prospect are too wintryhas too little fire in him: let him look about him and he will becomesensible of maladies requiring an icy air and of people who are sokneaded together out of ardor and intellect that they can scarcelyfind anywhere an atmosphere too cold and cutting for them. moreover: astoo serious individuals and nations stand in need of trivialrelaxations; as others too volatile and excitable require onerousweighty ordeals to render them entirely healthy: should not we the moreintellectual men of this age which is swept more and more byconflagrations catch up every cooling and extinguishing appliance wecan find that we may always remain as self contained steady and calm aswe are now and thereby perhaps serve this age as its mirror and selfreflector when the occasion arises=the fable of discretionary freedom.=--the history of the feelings onthe basis of which we make everyone responsible hence the so-calledmoral feelings is traceable in the following leading phases. at firstsingle actions are termed good or bad without any reference to theirmotive but solely because of the utilitarian or prejudicialconsequences they have for the community. in time however the originof these designations is forgotten but it is imagined that action initself without reference to its consequences contains the propertygood or bad: with the same error according to which languagedesignates the stone itself as hardness the tree itself asgreenness--for the reason therefore that what is a consequence iscomprehended as a cause. accordingly the goodness or badness isincorporated into the motive and any deed by itself is regarded asmorally ambiguous. a step further is taken and the predication good orbad is no longer made of the particular motives but of the entire natureof a man out of which motive grows as grow the plants out of the soil.thus man is successively made responsible for his particular actsthen for his course of conduct then for his motives and finally forhis nature. now at last is it discovered that this nature evencannot be responsible inasmuch as it is only and wholly a necessaryconsequence and is synthesised out of the elements and influence of pastand present things: therefore that man is to be made responsible fornothing neither for his nature nor his motives nor his course ofconduct nor his particular acts. by this process is gained theknowledge that the history of moral estimates is the history of errorof the error of responsibility: as is whatever rests upon the error ofthe freedom of the will. schopenhauer concluded just the other waythus: since certain actions bring depression consciousness of guiltin their train there must then exist responsibility for there wouldbe no basis for this depression at hand if all mans affairs did notfollow their course of necessity--as they do indeed according to theopinion of this philosopher follow their course--but man himselfsubject to the same necessity would be just the man that he is--whichschopenhauer denies. from the fact of such depression schopenhauerbelieves himself able to prove a freedom which man in some way must havehad not indeed in regard to his actions but in regard to his nature:freedom therefore to be thus and so not to act thus and so. out ofthe _esse_ the sphere of freedom and responsibility follows accordingto his opinion the _operari_ the spheres of invariable causationnecessity and irresponsibility. this depression indeed is dueapparently to the _operari_--in so far as it be delusive--but in truthto whatever _esse_ be the deed of a free will the basic cause of theexistence of an individual: in order to let man become whatever hewills to become his to will wollen must precede hisexistence.--here apart from the absurdity of the statement just madethere is drawn the wrong inference that the fact of the depressionexplains its character the rational admissibility of it: from such awrong inference does schopenhauer first come to his fantastic consequentof the so called discretionary freedom intelligibeln freiheit. forthe origin of this fabulous entity plato and kant are equallyresponsible. but depression after the act does not need to be rational:indeed it is certainly not so at all for it rests upon the erroneousassumption that the act need not necessarily have come to pass.therefore: only because man deems himself free but not becausehe is free does he experience remorse and the stings ofconscience.--moreover this depression is something that can be grownout of; in many men it is not present at all as a consequence of actswhich inspire it in many other men. it is a very varying thing and oneclosely connected with the development of custom and civilization andperhaps manifest only during a relatively brief period of the worldshistory.--no one is responsible for his acts no one for his nature; tojudge is tantamount to being unjust. this applies as well when theindividual judges himself. the proposition is as clear as sunlight andyet here everyone prefers to go back to darkness and untruth: for fearof the consequences.=above animal.=--the beast in us must be wheedled: ethic is necessarythat we may not be torn to pieces. without the errors involved in theassumptions of ethics man would have remained an animal. thus has hetaken himself as something higher and imposed rigid laws upon himself.he feels hatred consequently for states approximating the animal:whence the former contempt for the slave as a not-yet-man as a thingis to be explained.=unalterable character.=--that character is unalterable is not in thestrict sense true; rather is this favorite proposition valid only tothe extent that during the brief life period of a man the potent newmotives can not usually press down hard enough to obliterate the linesimprinted by ages. could we conceive of a man eighty thousand years oldwe should have in him an absolutely alterable character; so that thematurities of successive varying individuals would develop in him. theshortness of human life leads to many erroneous assertions concerningthe qualities of man.=classification of enjoyments and ethic.=--the once accepted comparativeclassification of enjoyments according to which an inferior higherhighest egoism may crave one or another enjoyment now decides as toethical status or unethical status. a lower enjoyment for examplesensual pleasure preferred to a more highly esteemed one for examplehealth rates as unethical as does welfare preferred to freedom. thecomparative classification of enjoyments is not however alike or thesame at all periods; when anyone demands satisfaction of the law he isfrom the point of view of an earlier civilization moral from that ofthe present non-moral. unethical indicates therefore that a man isnot sufficiently sensible to the higher finer impulses which thepresent civilization has brought with it or is not sensible to them atall; it indicates backwardness but only from the point of view of thecontemporary degree of distinction.--the comparative classification ofenjoyments itself is not determined according to absolute ethics; butafter each new ethical adjustment it is then decided whether conduct beethical or the reverse.=inhuman men as survivals.=--men who are now inhuman must serve us assurviving specimens of earlier civilizations. the mountain height ofhumanity here reveals its lower formations which might otherwise remainhidden from view. there are surviving specimens of humanity whose brainsthrough the vicissitudes of heredity have escaped proper development.they show us what we all were and thus appal us; but they are as littleresponsible on this account as is a piece of granite for being granite.in our own brains there must be courses and windings corresponding tosuch characters just as in the forms of some human organs there survivetraces of fishhood. but these courses and windings are no longer the bedin which flows the stream of our feeling.=gratitude and revenge.=--the reason the powerful man is grateful isthis. his benefactor has through his benefaction invaded the domain ofthe powerful man and established himself on an equal footing: thepowerful man in turn invades the domain of the benefactor and getssatisfaction through the act of gratitude. it is a mild form of revenge.by not obtaining the satisfaction of gratitude the powerful would haveshown himself powerless and have ranked as such thenceforward. henceevery society of the good that is to say of the powerful originallyplaces gratitude among the first of duties.--swift has added the dictumthat man is grateful in the same degree that he is revengeful.=two-fold historical origin of good and evil.=--the notion of good andbad has a two-fold historical origin: namely first in the spirit ofruling races and castes. whoever has power to requite good with good andevil with evil and actually brings requital that is is grateful andrevengeful acquires the name of being good; whoever is powerless andcannot requite is called bad. a man belongs as a good individual tothe good of a community who have a feeling in common because all theindividuals are allied with one another through the requiting sentiment.a man belongs as a bad individual to the bad to a mass ofsubjugated powerless men who have no feeling in common. the good are acaste the bad are a quantity like dust. good and bad is for aconsiderable period tantamount to noble and servile master and slave.on the other hand an enemy is not looked upon as bad: he can requite.the trojan and the greek are in homer both good. not he who does noharm but he who is despised is deemed bad. in the community of thegood individuals the quality of goodness is inherited; it isimpossible for a bad individual to grow from such a rich soil. ifnotwithstanding one of the good individuals does something unworthy ofhis goodness recourse is had to exorcism; thus the guilt is ascribed toa deity the while it is declared that this deity bewitched the good maninto madness and blindness.--second in the spirit of the subjugatedthe powerless. here every other man is to the individual hostileinconsiderate greedy inhuman avaricious be he noble or servile; badis the characteristic term for man for every living being indeed thatis recognized at all even for a god: human divine these notions aretantamount to devilish bad. manifestations of goodness sympathyhelpfulness are regarded with anxiety as trickiness preludes to anevil end deception subtlety in short as refined badness. with such apredisposition in individuals a feeling in common can scarcely arise atall at most only the rudest form of it: so that everywhere that thisconception of good and evil prevails the destruction of theindividuals their race and nation is imminent.--our existing moralityhas developed upon the foundation laid by ruling races and castes.=sympathy greater than suffering.=--there are circumstances in whichsympathy is stronger than the suffering itself. we feel more pain forinstance when one of our friends becomes guilty of a reprehensibleaction than if we had done the deed ourselves. we once that is hadmore faith in the purity of his character than he had himself. hence ourlove for him apparently because of this very faith is stronger thanis his own love for himself. if indeed his egoism really suffers moreas a result than our egoism inasmuch as he must take the consequencesof his fault to a greater extent than ourselves nevertheless theunegoistic--this word is not to be taken too strictly but simply as amodified form of expression--in us is more affected by his guilt thanthe unegoistic in him.=hypochondria.=--there are people who from sympathy and anxiety forothers become hypochondriacal. the resulting form of compassion isnothing else than sickness. so also is there a christian hypochondriafrom which those singular religiously agitated people suffer who placealways before their eyes the suffering and death of christ.=economy of blessings.=--the advantageous and the pleasing as thehealthiest growths and powers in the intercourse of men are suchprecious treasures that it is much to be wished the use made of thesebalsamic means were as economical as possible: but this is impossible.economy in the use of blessings is the dream of the craziest ofutopians.=well-wishing.=--among the small but infinitely plentiful and thereforevery potent things to which science must pay more attention than to thegreat uncommon things well-wishing must be reckoned; i mean thosemanifestations of friendly disposition in intercourse that laughter ofthe eye every hand pressure every courtesy from which in generalevery human act gets its quality. every teacher every functionary addsthis element as a gratuity to whatever he does as a duty; it is theperpetual well spring of humanity like the waves of light in whicheverything grows; thus in the narrowest circles within the familylife blooms and flowers only through this kind feeling. thecheerfulness friendliness and kindness of a heart are unfailingsources of unegoistic impulse and have made far more for civilizationthan those other more noised manifestations of it that are styledsympathy benevolence and sacrifice. but it is customary to depreciatethese little tokens of kindly feeling and indeed there is not much ofthe unegoistic in them. the sum of these little doses is very greatnevertheless; their combined strength is of the greatest ofstrengths.--thus too much more happiness is to be found in the worldthan gloomy eyes discover: that is if the calculation be just and allthese pleasing moments in which every day even the meanest human lifeis rich be not forgotten. wohl-wollen kind feeling. it stands here for benevolence but notbenevolence in the restricted sense of the word now prevailing.=the desire to inspire compassion.=--la rochefoucauld in the mostnotable part of his self portraiture first printed  reaches thevital spot of truth when he warns all those endowed with reason to be ontheir guard against compassion when he advises that this sentiment beleft to men of the masses who stand in need of the promptings of theemotions since they are not guided by reason to induce them to giveaid to the suffering and to be of service in misfortune: whereascompassion in his and platos view deprives the heart of strength.to be sure sympathy should be manifested but men should take care notto feel it; for the unfortunate are rendered so dull that themanifestation of sympathy affords them the greatest happiness in theworld.--perhaps a more effectual warning against this compassion can begiven if this need of the unfortunate be considered not simply asstupidity and intellectual weakness not as a sort of distraction of thespirit entailed by misfortune itself and thus indeed does larochefoucauld seem to view it but as something quite different and moremomentous. let note be taken of children who cry and scream in order tobe compassionated and who therefore await the moment when theircondition will be observed; come into contact with the sick and theoppressed in spirit and try to ascertain if the wailing and sighing theposturing and posing of misfortune do not have as end and aim thecausing of pain to the beholder: the sympathy which each beholdermanifests is a consolation to the weak and suffering only in as much asthey are made to perceive that at least they have the powernotwithstanding all their weakness to inflict pain. the unfortunateexperiences a species of joy in the sense of superiority which themanifestation of sympathy entails; his imagination is exalted; he isalways strong enough then to cause the world pain. thus is the thirstfor sympathy a thirst for self enjoyment and at the expense of onesfellow creatures: it shows man in the whole ruthlessness of his own dearself: not in his mere dullness as la rochefoucauld thinks.--in socialconversation three fourths of all the questions are asked and threefourths of all the replies are made in order to inflict some littlepain; that is why so many people crave social intercourse: it gives thema sense of their power. in these countless but very small doses in whichthe quality of badness is administered it proves a potent stimulant oflife: to the same extent that well wishing--wohl-wollen distributedthrough the world in like manner is one of the ever readyrestoratives.--but will many honorable people be found to admit thatthere is any pleasure in administering pain that entertainment--andrare entertainment--is not seldom found in causing others at least inthought some pain and in raking them with the small shot ofwickedness the majority are too ignoble and a few are too good to knowanything of this pudendum: the latter may consequently be prompt todeny that prosper mã©rimã©e is right when he says: know also thatnothing is more common than to do wrong for the pleasure of doing it.=how appearance becomes reality.=--the actor cannot at last refraineven in moments of the deepest pain from thinking of the effectproduced by his deportment and by his surroundings--for example even atthe funeral of his own child: he will weep at his own sorrow and itsmanifestations as though he were his own audience. the hypocrite whoalways plays one and the same part finally ceases to be a hypocrite; asin the case of priests who when young men are always eitherconsciously or unconsciously hypocrites and finally become naturallyand then really without affectation mere priests: or if the fatherdoes not carry it to this extent the son who inherits his fatherscalling and gets the advantage of the paternal progress does. whenanyone during a long period and persistently wishes to appearsomething it will at last prove difficult for him to be anything else.the calling of almost every man even of the artist begins withhypocrisy with an imitation of deportment with a copying of theeffective in manner. he who always wears the mask of a friendly man mustat last gain a power over friendliness of disposition without which theexpression itself of friendliness is not to be gained--and finallyfriendliness of disposition gains the ascendancy over him--he _is_benevolent.=the point of honor in deception.=--in all great deceivers onecharacteristic is prominent to which they owe their power. in the veryact of deception amid all the accompaniments the agitation in thevoice the expression the bearing in the crisis of the scene therecomes over them a belief in themselves; this it is that acts soeffectively and irresistibly upon the beholders. founders of religionsdiffer from such great deceivers in that they never come out of thisstate of self deception or else they have very rarely a few momentsof enlightenment in which they are overcome by doubt; generallyhowever they soothe themselves by ascribing such moments ofenlightenment to the evil adversary. self deception must exist that bothclasses of deceivers may attain far reaching results. for men believe inthe truth of all that is manifestly believed with due implicitness byothers.=presumed degrees of truth.=--one of the most usual errors of deductionis: because someone truly and openly is against us therefore he speaksthe truth. hence the child has faith in the judgments of its elders thechristian in the assertions of the founder of the church. so too itwill not be admitted that all for which men sacrificed life andhappiness in former centuries was nothing but delusion: perhaps it isalleged these things were degrees of truth. but what is really meant isthat if a person sincerely believes a thing and has fought and died forhis faith it would be too _unjust_ if only delusion had inspired him.such a state of affairs seems to contradict eternal justice. for thatreason the heart of a sensitive man pronounces against his head thejudgment: between moral conduct and intellectual insight there mustalways exist an inherent connection. it is unfortunately otherwise:for there is no eternal justice.=falsehood.=--why do men as a rule speak the truth in the ordinaryaffairs of life certainly not for the reason that a god has forbiddenlying. but because first: it is more convenient as falsehood entailsinvention make-believe and recollection wherefore swift says thatwhoever invents a lie seldom realises the heavy burden he takes up: hemust namely for every lie that he tells insert twenty more.therefore because in plain ordinary relations of life it is expedientto say without circumlocution: i want this i have done this and thelike; therefore because the way of freedom and certainty is surer thanthat of ruse.--but if it happens that a child is brought up in sinisterdomestic circumstances it will then indulge in falsehood as matter ofcourse and involuntarily say anything its own interests may prompt: aninclination for truth an aversion to falsehood is quite foreign anduncongenial to it and hence it lies in all innocence.=ethic discredited for faiths sake.=--no power can sustain itself whenit is represented by mere humbugs: the catholic church may possess everso many worldly sources of strength but its true might is comprisedin those still numberless priestly natures who make their lives sternand strenuous and whose looks and emaciated bodies are eloquent of nightvigils fasts ardent prayer perhaps even of whip lashes: these thingsmake men tremble and cause them anxiety: what if it be reallyimperative to live thus this is the dreadful question which theiraspect occasions. as they spread this doubt they lay anew the prop oftheir power: even the free thinkers dare not oppose suchdisinterestedness with severe truth and cry: thou deceived onedeceive not!--only the difference of standpoint separates them fromhim: no difference in goodness or badness. but things we cannotaccomplish ourselves we are apt to criticise unfairly. thus we are toldof the cunning and perverted acts of the jesuits but we overlook theself mastery that each jesuit imposes upon himself and also the factthat the easy life which the jesuit manuals advocate is for the benefitnot of the jesuits but the laity. indeed it may be questioned whetherwe enlightened ones would become equally competent workers as the resultof similar tactics and organization and equally worthy of admiration asthe result of self mastery indefatigable industry and devotion.=victory of knowledge over radical evil.=--it proves a material gain tohim who would attain knowledge to have had during a considerable periodthe idea that mankind is a radically bad and perverted thing: it is afalse idea as is its opposite but it long held sway and its roots havereached down even to ourselves and our present world. in order tounderstand _ourselves_ we must understand _it_; but in order to attain aloftier height we must step above it. we then perceive that there is nosuch thing as sin in the metaphysical sense: but also in the samesense no such thing as virtue; that this whole domain of ethicalnotions is one of constant variation; that there are higher and deeperconceptions of good and evil moral and immoral. whoever desires no moreof things than knowledge of them attains speedily to peace of mind andwill at most err through lack of knowledge but scarcely througheagerness for knowledge or through sin as the world calls it. he willnot ask that eagerness for knowledge be interdicted and rooted out; buthis single all powerful ambition to _know_ as thoroughly and as fullyas possible will soothe him and moderate all that is strenuous in hiscircumstances. moreover he is now rid of a number of disturbingnotions; he is no longer beguiled by such words as hell-painsinfulness unworthiness: he sees in them merely the flitting shadowpictures of false views of life and of the world.=ethic as mans self-analysis.=--a good author whose heart is really inhis work wishes that someone would arise and wholly refute him if onlythereby his subject be wholly clarified and made plain. the maid in lovewishes that she could attest the fidelity of her own passion throughthe faithlessness of her beloved. the soldier wishes to sacrifice hislife on the field of his fatherlands victory: for in the victory of hisfatherland his highest end is attained. the mother gives her child whatshe deprives herself of--sleep the best nourishment and in certaincircumstances her health her self.--but are all these acts unegoisticare these moral deeds miracles because they are in schopenhauersphrase impossible and yet accomplished is it not evident that in allfour cases man loves one part of himself a thought a longing anexperience more than he loves another part of himself that he thusanalyses his being and sacrifices one part of it to another part isthis essentially different from the behavior of the obstinate man whosays i would rather be shot than go a step out of my way for thisfellow--preference for something wish impulse longing is presentin all four instances: to yield to it with all its consequences is notunegoistic.--in the domain of the ethical man conducts himself not asindividuum but as dividuum.=what can be promised.=--actions can be promised but not feelings forthese are involuntary. whoever promises somebody to love him always orto hate him always or to be ever true to him promises something thatit is out of his power to bestow. but he really can promise such coursesof conduct as are the ordinary accompaniments of love of hate offidelity but which may also have their source in motives quitedifferent: for various ways and motives lead to the same conduct. thepromise to love someone always means consequently: as long as i loveyou i will manifest the deportment of love; but if i cease to love youmy deportment although from some other motive will be just the sameso that to the people about us it will seem as if my love remainedunchanged.--hence it is the continuance of the deportment of love thatis promised in every instance in which eternal love provided no elementof self deception be involved is sworn.=intellect and ethic.=--one must have a good memory to be able to keepthe promises one makes. one must have a strong imagination in order tofeel sympathy. so closely is ethics connected with intellectualcapacity.=desire for vengeance and vengeance itself.=--to meditate revenge andattain it is tantamount to an attack of fever that passes away: but tomeditate revenge without possessing the strength or courage to attain itis tantamount to suffering from a chronic malady or poisoning of bodyand soul. ethics which takes only the motive into account rates bothcases alike: people generally estimate the first case as the worstbecause of the consequences which the deed of vengeance may entail.both views are short sighted.=ability to wait.=--ability to wait is so hard to acquire that greatpoets have not disdained to make inability to wait the central motive oftheir poems. so shakespeare in othello sophocles in ajax whose suicidewould not have seemed to him so imperative had he only been able to coolhis ardor for a day as the oracle foreboded: apparently he would thenhave repulsed somewhat the fearful whispers of distracted thought andhave said to himself: who has not already in my situation mistaken asheep for a hero is it so extraordinary a thing on the contrary it issomething universally human: ajax should thus have soothed himself.passion will not wait: the tragic element in the lives of great men doesnot generally consist in their conflict with time and the inferiorityof their fellowmen but in their inability to put off their work a yearor two: they cannot wait.--in all duels the friends who advise have butto ascertain if the principals can wait: if this be not possible a duelis rational inasmuch as each of the combatants may say: either icontinue to live and the other dies instantly or vice versa. to waitin such circumstances would be equivalent to the frightful martyrdom ofenduring dishonor in the presence of him responsible for the dishonor:and this can easily cost more anguish than life is worth.=glutting revenge.=--coarse men who feel a sense of injury are in thehabit of rating the extent of their injury as high as possible and ofstating the occasion of it in greatly exaggerated language in order tobe able to feast themselves on the sentiments of hatred and revenge thusaroused.=value of disparagement.=--not a few perhaps the majority of men findit necessary in order to retain their self esteem and a certainuprightness in conduct to mentally disparage and belittle all thepeople they know. but as the inferior natures are in the majority and asa great deal depends upon whether they retain or lose this uprightnessso--=the man in a rage.=--we should be on our guard against the man who isenraged against us as against one who has attempted our life for thefact that we still live consists solely in the inability to kill: werelooks sufficient it would have been all up with us long since. toreduce anyone to silence by physical manifestations of savagery or by aterrorizing process is a relic of under civilization. so too that coldlook which great personages cast upon their servitors is a remnant ofthe caste distinction between man and man; a specimen of rude antiquity:women the conservers of the old have maintained this survival toomore perfectly than men.=whither honesty may lead.=--someone once had the bad habit ofexpressing himself upon occasion and with perfect honesty on thesubject of the motives of his conduct which were as good or as bad asthe motives of all men. he aroused first disfavor then suspicionbecame gradually of ill repute and was pronounced a person of whomsociety should beware until at last the law took note of such aperverted being for reasons which usually have no weight with it or towhich it closes its eyes. lack of taciturnity concerning what isuniversally held secret and an irresponsible predisposition to see whatno one wants to see--oneself--brought him to prison and to early death.=punishable not punished.=--our crime against criminals consists in thefact that we treat them as rascals.=sancta simplicitas of virtue.=--every virtue has its privilege: forexample that of contributing its own little bundle of wood to thefuneral pyre of one condemned.=morality and consequence.=--not alone the beholders of an act generallyestimate the ethical or unethical element in it by the result: no theone who performed the act does the same. for the motives and theintentions are seldom sufficiently apparent and amid them the memoryitself seems to become clouded by the results of the act so that a manoften ascribes the wrong motives to his acts or regards the remotemotives as the direct ones. success often imparts to an action all thebrilliance and honor of good intention while failure throws the shadowof conscience over the most estimable deeds. hence arises the familiarmaxim of the politician: give me only success: with it i can win allthe noble souls over to my side--and make myself noble even in my owneyes.--in like manner will success prove an excellent substitute for abetter argument. to this very day many well educated men think thetriumph of christianity over greek philosophy is a proof of the superiortruth of the former--although in this case it was simply the coarser andmore powerful that triumphed over the more delicate and intellectual. asregards superiority of truth it is evident that because of it thereviving sciences have connected themselves point for point with thephilosophy of epicurus while christianity has point for pointrecoiled from it.=love and justice.=--why is love so highly prized at the expense ofjustice and why are such beautiful things spoken of the former as if itwere a far higher entity than the latter is the former not palpably afar more stupid thing than the latter--certainly and on that veryaccount so much the more agreeable to everybody: it is blind and has arich horn of plenty out of which it distributes its gifts to everyoneeven when they are unmerited even when no thanks are returned. it isimpartial like the rain which according to the bible and experiencewets not alone the unjust but in certain circumstances the just aswell and to their skins at that.=execution.=--how comes it that every execution causes us more pain thana murder it is the coolness of the executioner the painfulpreparation the perception that here a man is being used as aninstrument for the intimidation of others. for the guilt is not punishedeven if there be any: this is ascribable to the teachers the parentsthe environment in ourselves not in the murderer--i mean thepredisposing circumstances.=hope.=--pandora brought the box containing evils and opened it. it wasthe gift of the gods to men a gift of most enticing appearanceexternally and called the box of happiness. thereupon all the evilsliving moving things flew out: from that time to the present they flyabout and do ill to men by day and night. one evil only did not fly outof the box: pandora shut the lid at the behest of zeus and it remainedinside. now man has this box of happiness perpetually in the house andcongratulates himself upon the treasure inside of it; it is at hisservice: he grasps it whenever he is so disposed for he knows not thatthe box which pandora brought was a box of evils. hence he looks uponthe one evil still remaining as the greatest source of happiness--it ishope.--zeus intended that man notwithstanding the evils oppressing himshould continue to live and not rid himself of life but keep on makinghimself miserable. for this purpose he bestowed hope upon man: it is intruth the greatest of evils for it lengthens the ordeal of man.=degree of moral susceptibility unknown.=--the fact that one has or hasnot had certain profoundly moving impressions and insights intothings--for example an unjustly executed slain or martyred father afaithless wife a shattering serious accident--is the factor uponwhich the excitation of our passions to white heat principally dependsas well as the course of our whole lives. no one knows to what lengthscircumstances sympathy emotion may lead him. he does not know thefull extent of his own susceptibility. wretched environment makes himwretched. it is as a rule not the quality of our experience but itsquantity upon which depends the development of our superiority orinferiority from the point of view of good and evil.=the martyr against his will.=--in a certain movement there was a manwho was too cowardly and vacillating ever to contradict his comrades. hewas made use of in each emergency every sacrifice was demanded of himbecause he feared the disfavor of his comrades more than he feareddeath: he was a petty abject spirit. they perceived this and upon thefoundation of the qualities just mentioned they elevated him to thealtitude of a hero and finally even of a martyr. although the cowardlycreature always inwardly said no he always said yes with his lips evenupon the scaffold where he died for the tenets of his party: for besidehim stood one of his old associates who so domineered him with look andword that he actually went to his death with the utmost fortitude andhas ever since been celebrated as a martyr and exalted character.=general standard.=--one will rarely err if extreme actions be ascribedto vanity ordinary actions to habit and mean actions to fear.=misunderstanding of virtue.=--whoever has obtained his experience ofvice in connection with pleasure as in the case of one with a youth ofwild oats behind him comes to the conclusion that virtue must beconnected with self denial. whoever on the other hand has been verymuch plagued by his passions and vices longs to find in virtue the restand peace of the soul. that is why it is possible for two virtuouspeople to misunderstand one another wholly.=the ascetic.=--the ascetic makes out of virtue a slavery.=honor transferred from persons to things.=--actions prompted by love orby the spirit of self sacrifice for others are universally honoredwherever they are manifest. hence is magnified the value set uponwhatever things may be loved or whatever things conduce to selfsacrifice: although in themselves they may be worth nothing much. avaliant army is evidence of the value of the thing it fights for.=ambition a substitute for moral feeling.=--moral feeling should neverbecome extinct in natures that are destitute of ambition. the ambitiouscan get along without moral feeling just as well as with it.--hence thesons of retired ambitionless families generally become by a series ofrapid gradations when they lose moral feeling the most absolutelunkheads.=vanity enriches.=--how poor the human mind would be without vanity! asit is it resembles a well stacked and ever renewed ware-emporium thatattracts buyers of every class: they can find almost everything havealmost everything provided they bring with them the right kind ofmoney--admiration.=senility and death.=--apart from the demands made by religion it maywell be asked why it is more honorable in an aged man who feels thedecline of his powers to await slow extinction than to fix a term tohis existence himself suicide in such a case is a quite natural and dueproceeding that ought to command respect as a triumph of reason: and didin fact command respect during the times of the masters of greekphilosophy and the bravest roman patriots who usually died by their ownhand. eagerness on the other hand to keep alive from day to day withthe anxious counsel of physicians without capacity to attain any nearerto ones ideal of life is far less worthy of respect.--religions arevery rich in refuges from the mandate of suicide: hence they ingratiatethemselves with those who cling to life.=delusions regarding victim and regarding evil doer.=--when the rich mantakes a possession away from the poor man for example a prince whodeprives a plebeian of his beloved there arises in the mind of the poorman a delusion: he thinks the rich man must be wholly perverted to takefrom him the little that he has. but the rich man appreciates the valueof a single possession much less because he is accustomed to manypossessions so that he cannot put himself in the place of the poor manand does not act by any means as ill as the latter supposes. both have atotally false idea of each other. the iniquities of the mighty whichbulk most largely in history are not nearly so monstrous as they seem.the hereditary consciousness of being a superior being with superiorenvironment renders one very callous and lulls the conscience to rest.we all feel when the difference between ourselves and some other beingis exceedingly great that no element of injustice can be involved andwe kill a fly with no qualms of conscience whatever. so too it is noindication of wickedness in xerxes whom even the greeks represent asexceptionally noble that he deprived a father of his son and had himdrawn and quartered because the latter had manifested a troublesomeominous distrust of an entire expedition: the individual was in thiscase brushed aside as a pestiferous insect. he was too low and mean tojustify continued sentiments of compunction in the ruler of the world.indeed no cruel man is ever as cruel in the main as his victim thinks.the idea of pain is never the same as the sensation. the rule isprecisely analogous in the case of the unjust judge and of thejournalist who by means of devious rhetorical methods leads publicopinion astray. cause and effect are in all these instances entwinedwith totally different series of feeling and thoughts whereas it isunconsciously assumed that principal and victim feel and think exactlyalike and because of this assumption the guilt of the one is based uponthe pain of the other.=the souls skin.=--as the bones flesh entrails and blood vessels areenclosed by a skin that renders the aspect of men endurable so theimpulses and passions of the soul are enclosed by vanity: it is the skinof the soul.=sleep of virtue.=--if virtue goes to sleep it will be more vigorouswhen it awakes.=subtlety of shame.=--men are not ashamed of obscene thoughts but theyare ashamed when they suspect that obscene thoughts are attributed tothem.=naughtiness is rare.=--most people are too much absorbed in themselvesto be bad.=the mite in the balance.=--we are praised or blamed as the one or theother may be expedient for displaying to advantage our power ofdiscernment.=luke : improved.=--he that humbleth himself wisheth to be exalted.=prevention of suicide.=--there is a justice according to which we maydeprive a man of life but none that permits us to deprive him of death:this is merely cruelty.=vanity.=--we set store by the good opinion of men first because it isof use to us and next because we wish to give them pleasure childrentheir parents pupils their teacher and well disposed persons allothers generally. only when the good opinion of men is important tosomebody apart from personal advantage or the desire to give pleasuredo we speak of vanity. in this last case a man wants to give himselfpleasure but at the expense of his fellow creatures inasmuch as heinspires them with a false opinion of himself or else inspires goodopinion in such a way that it is a source of pain to others byarousing envy. the individual generally seeks through the opinion ofothers to attest and fortify the opinion he has of himself; but thepotent influence of authority--an influence as old as man himself--leadsmany also to strengthen their own opinion of themselves by means ofauthority that is to borrow from others the expedient of relying moreupon the judgment of their fellow men than upon their own.--interest inoneself the wish to please oneself attains with the vain man suchproportions that he first misleads others into a false unduly exaltedestimate of himself and then relies upon the authority of others for hisself estimate; he thus creates the delusion that he pins his faithto.--it must however be admitted that the vain man does not desire toplease others so much as himself and he will often go so far on thisaccount as to overlook his own interests: for he often inspires hisfellow creatures with malicious envy and renders them ill disposed inorder that he may thus increase his own delight in himself.=limits of the love of mankind.=--every man who has declared that someother man is an ass or a scoundrel gets angry when the other manconclusively shows that the assertion was erroneous.=weeping morality.=--how much delight morality occasions! think of theocean of pleasing tears that has flowed from the narration of noblegreat-hearted deeds!--this charm of life would disappear if the beliefin complete irresponsibility gained the upper hand.=origin of justice.=--justice reasonableness has its origin amongapproximate equals in power as thucydides in the dreadful conferencesof the athenian and melian envoys has rightly conceived. thus wherethere exists no demonstrable supremacy and a struggle leads but tomutual useless damage the reflection arises that an understandingwould best be arrived at and some compromise entered into. thereciprocal nature is hence the first nature of justice. each party makesthe other content inasmuch as each receives what it prizes more highlythan the other. each surrenders to the other what the other wants andreceives in return its own desire. justice is therefore reprisal andexchange upon the basis of an approximate equality of power. thusrevenge pertains originally to the domain of justice as it is a sort ofreciprocity. equally so gratitude.--justice reverts naturally to thestandpoint of self preservation therefore to the egoism of thisconsideration: why should i injure myself to no purpose and perhapsnever attain my end--so much for the origin of justice. only becausemen through mental habits have forgotten the original motive of socalled just and rational acts and also because for thousands of yearschildren have been brought to admire and imitate such acts have theygradually assumed the appearance of being unegotistical. upon thisappearance is founded the high estimate of them which moreover likeall estimates is continually developing for whatever is highlyesteemed is striven for imitated made the object of self sacrificewhile the merit of the pain and emulation thus expended is by eachindividual ascribed to the thing esteemed.--how slightly moral wouldthe world appear without forgetfulness! a poet could say that god hadposted forgetfulness as a sentinel at the portal of the temple of humanmerit!=concerning the law of the weaker.=--whenever any party for instance abesieged city yields to a stronger party under stipulated conditionsthe counter stipulation is that there be a reduction to insignificancea burning and destruction of the city and thus a great damage inflictedupon the stronger party. thus arises a sort of equalization principleupon the basis of which a law can be established. the enemy has anadvantage to gain by its maintenance.--to this extent there is also alaw between slaves and masters limited only by the extent to which theslave may be useful to his master. the law goes originally only so faras the one party may appear to the other potent invincible stable andthe like. to such an extent then the weaker has rights but verylimited ones. hence the famous dictum that each has as much law on hisside as his power extends or more accurately as his power is believedto extend.=the three phases of morality hitherto.=--it is the first evidence thatthe animal has become human when his conduct ceases to be based upon theimmediately expedient but upon the permanently useful; when he hastherefore grown utilitarian capable of purpose. thus is manifested thefirst rule of reason. a still higher stage is attained when he regulateshis conduct upon the basis of honor by means of which he gains masteryof himself and surrenders his desires to principles; this lifts him farabove the phase in which he was actuated only by considerations ofpersonal advantage as he understood it. he respects and wishes to berespected. this means that he comprehends utility as a thing dependentupon what his opinion of others is and their opinion of him. finally heregulates his conduct the highest phase of morality hitherto attainedby his own standard of men and things. he himself decides for himselfand for others what is honorable and what is useful. he has become alaw giver to opinion upon the basis of his ever higher developingconception of the utilitarian and the honorable. knowledge makes himcapable of placing the highest utility that is the universalenduring utility before merely personal utility--of placing ennoblingrecognition of the enduring and universal before the merely temporary:he lives and acts as a collective individuality.=ethic of the developed individual.=--hitherto the altruistic has beenlooked upon as the distinctive characteristic of moral conduct and itis manifest that it was the consideration of universal utility thatprompted praise and recognition of altruistic conduct. must not aradical departure from this point of view be imminent now that it isbeing ever more clearly perceived that in the most personalconsiderations the most general welfare is attained: so that conductinspired by the most personal considerations of advantage is just thesort which has its origin in the present conception of morality as auniversal utilitarianism to contemplate oneself as a completepersonality and bear the welfare of that personality in mind in all thatone does--this is productive of better results than any sympatheticsusceptibility and conduct in behalf of others. indeed we all sufferfrom such disparagement of our own personalities which are at presentmade to deteriorate from neglect. capacity is in fact divorced fromour personality in most cases and sacrificed to the state to scienceto the needy as if it were the bad which deserved to be made asacrifice. now we are willing to labor for our fellowmen but only tothe extent that we find our own highest advantage in so doing no moreno less. the whole matter depends upon what may be understood as onesadvantage: the crude undeveloped rough individualities will be thevery ones to estimate it most inadequately.=usage and ethic.=--to be moral virtuous praiseworthy means to yieldobedience to ancient law and hereditary usage. whether this obedience berendered readily or with difficulty is long immaterial. enough that itbe rendered. good finally comes to mean him who acts in thetraditional manner as a result of heredity or natural disposition thatis to say does what is customary with scarcely an effort whatever thatmay be for example revenges injuries when revenge as with the ancientgreeks was part of good morals. he is called good because he is goodto some purpose and as benevolence sympathy consideratenessmoderation and the like come in the general course of conduct to befinally recognized as good to some purpose as utilitarian thebenevolent man the helpful man is duly styled good. at first otherand more important kinds of utilitarian qualities stand in theforeground. bad is not habitual unusual to do things not inaccordance with usage to oppose the traditional however rational orthe reverse the traditional may be. to do injury to ones social groupor community and to ones neighbor as thus understood is looked uponthrough all the variations of moral laws in different ages as thepeculiarly immoral act so that to-day we associate the word badwith deliberate injury to ones neighbor or community. egoistic andnon-egoistic do not constitute the fundamental opposites that havebrought mankind to make a distinction between moral and immoral goodand bad; but adherence to traditional custom and emancipation from it.how the traditional had its origin is quite immaterial; in any event ithad no reference to good and bad or any categorical imperative but tothe all important end of maintaining and sustaining the community therace the confederation the nation. every superstitious custom thatoriginated in a misinterpreted event or casualty entailed sometradition to adhere to which is moral. to break loose from it isdangerous more prejudicial to the community than to the individualbecause divinity visits the consequences of impiety and sacrilege uponthe community rather than upon the individual. now every traditiongrows ever more venerable--the more remote is its origin the moreconfused that origin is. the reverence due to it increases fromgeneration to generation. the tradition finally becomes holy andinspires awe. thus it is that the precept of piety is a far loftiermorality than that inculcated by altruistic conduct.=delight in the moral.=--a potent species of joy and thereby the sourceof morality is custom. the customary is done more easily bettertherefore preferably. a pleasure is felt in it and experience thus showsthat since this practice has held its own it must be good. a manner ormoral that lives and lets live is thus demonstrated advantageousnecessary in contradistinction to all new and not yet adoptedpractices. the custom is therefore the blending of the agreeable and theuseful. moreover it does not require deliberation. as soon as man canexercise compulsion he exercises it to enforce and establish hiscustoms for they are to him attested lifewisdom. so too a communityof individuals constrains each one of their number to adopt the samemoral or custom. the error herein is this: because a certain custom hasbeen agreeable to the feelings or at least because it proves a means ofmaintenance this custom must be imperative for it is regarded as theonly thing that can possibly be consistent with well being. the wellbeing of life seems to spring from it alone. this conception of thecustomary as a condition of existence is carried into the slightestdetail of morality. inasmuch as insight into true causation is quiterestricted in all inferior peoples a superstitious anxiety is felt thateverything be done in due routine. even when a custom is exceedinglyburdensome it is preserved because of its supposed vital utility. it isnot known that the same degree of satisfaction can be experiencedthrough some other custom and even higher degrees of satisfaction too.but it is fully appreciated that all customs do become more agreeablewith the lapse of time no matter how difficult they may have been foundin the beginning and that even the severest way of life may be rendereda matter of habit and therefore a pleasure.=pleasure and social instinct.=--through his relations with other menman derives a new species of delight in those pleasurable emotions whichhis own personality affords him; whereby the domain of pleasurableemotions is made infinitely more comprehensive. no doubt he hasinherited many of these feelings from the brutes which palpably feeldelight when they sport with one another as mothers with their young.so too the sexual relations must be taken into account: they makeevery young woman interesting to every young man from the standpoint ofpleasure and conversely. the feeling of pleasure originating in humanrelationships makes men in general better. the delight in common thepleasures enjoyed together heighten one another. the individual feels asense of security. he becomes better natured. distrust and malicedissolve. for the man feels the sense of benefit and observes the samefeeling in others. mutual manifestations of pleasure inspire mutualsympathy the sentiment of homogeneity. the same effect is felt also atmutual sufferings in a common danger in stormy weather. upon such afoundation are built the earliest alliances: the object of which is themutual protection and safety from threatening misfortunes and thewelfare of each individual. and thus the social instinct develops frompleasure.=the guiltless nature of so-called bad acts.=--all bad acts areinspired by the impulse to self preservation or more accurately bythe desire for pleasure and for the avoidance of pain in the individual.thus are they occasioned but they are not therefore bad. pain selfprepared does not exist except in the brains of the philosophers anymore than pleasure self prepared sympathy in the schopenhauer sense.in the condition anterior to the state we kill the creature be it manor ape that attempts to pluck the fruit of a tree before we pluck itourselves should we happen to be hungry at the time and making for thattree: as we would do to-day so far as the brute is concerned if wewere wandering in savage regions.--the bad acts which most disturb us atpresent do so because of the erroneous supposition that the one who isguilty of them towards us has a free will in the matter and that it waswithin his discretion not to have done these evil things. this belief indiscretionary power inspires hate thirst for revenge malice theentire perversion of the mental processes whereas we would feel in noway incensed against the brute as we hold it irresponsible. to inflictpain not from the instinct of self preservation but in requital--this isthe consequence of false judgment and is equally a guiltless course ofconduct. the individual can in that condition which is anterior to thestate act with fierceness and violence for the intimidation of anothercreature in order to render his own power more secure as a result ofsuch acts of intimidation. thus acts the powerful the superior theoriginal state founder who subjugates the weaker. he has the right todo so as the state nowadays assumes the same right or to be moreaccurate there is no right that can conflict with this. a foundationfor all morality can first be laid only when a stronger individuality ora collective individuality for example society the state subjects thesingle personalities hence builds upon their unification andestablishes a bond of union. morality results from compulsion it isindeed itself one long compulsion to which obedience is rendered inorder that pain may be avoided. at first it is but custom later freeobedience and finally almost instinct. at last it is like everythinghabitual and natural associated with pleasure--and is then calledvirtue.=shame.=--shame exists wherever a mystery exists: but this is areligious notion which in the earlier period of human civilization hadgreat vogue. everywhere there were circumscribed spots to which accesswas denied on account of some divine law except in specialcircumstances. at first these spots were quite extensive inasmuch asstipulated areas could not be trod by the uninitiated who when nearthem felt tremors and anxieties. this sentiment was frequentlytransferred to other relationships for example to sexual relationswhich as the privilege and gateway of mature age must be withdrawnfrom the contemplation of youth for its own advantage: relations whichmany divinities were busy in preserving and sanctifying images of whichdivinities were duly placed in marital chambers as guardians. inturkish such an apartment is termed a harem or holy thing the same wordalso designating the vestibule of a mosque. so too kingship isregarded as a centre from which power and brilliance stream forth as amystery to the subjects impregnated with secrecy and shame sentimentsstill quite operative among peoples who in other respects are withoutany shame at all. so too is the whole world of inward states theso-called soul even now for all non-philosophical persons amystery and during countless ages it was looked upon as a somethingof divine origin in direct communion with deity. it is therefore anadytum and occasions shame.=judge not.=--care must be taken in the contemplation of earlier agesthat there be no falling into unjust scornfulness. the injustice inslavery the cruelty in the subjugation of persons and peoples must notbe estimated by our standard. for in that period the instinct of justicewas not so highly developed. who dare reproach the genoese calvin forburning the physician servetus at the stake it was a proceeding growingout of his convictions. and the inquisition too had its justification.the only thing is that the prevailing views were false and led to thoseproceedings which seem so cruel to us simply because such views havebecome foreign to us. besides what is the burning alive of oneindividual compared with eternal hell pains for everybody else and yetthis idea then had hold of all the world without in the least vitiatingwith its frightfulness the other idea of a god. even we nowadays arehard and merciless to political revolutionists but that is because weare in the habit of believing the state a necessity and hence thecruelty of the proceeding is not so much understood as in the othercases where the points of view are repudiated. the cruelty to animalsshown by children and italians is due to the same misunderstanding. theanimal owing to the exigencies of the church catechism is placed toofar below the level of mankind.--much too that is frightful andinhuman in history and which is almost incredible is rendered lessatrocious by the reflection that the one who commands and the one whoexecutes are different persons. the former does not witness theperformance and hence it makes no strong impression on him. the latterobeys a superior and hence feels no responsibility. most princes andmilitary chieftains appear through lack of true perception cruel andhard without really being so.--egoism is not bad because the idea of theneighbor--the word is of christian origin and does not correspond totruth--is very weak in us and we feel ourselves in regard to him asfree from responsibility as if plants and stones were involved. thatanother is in suffering must be learned and it can never be whollylearned.=man always does right.=--we do not blame nature when she sends athunder storm and makes us wet: why then do we term the man who inflictsinjury immoral because in the latter case we assume a voluntaryruling free will and in the former necessity. but this distinction isa delusion. moreover even the intentional infliction of injury is notin all circumstances termed immoral. thus we kill a fly intentionallywithout thinking very much about it simply because its buzzing about isdisagreeable; and we punish a criminal and inflict pain upon him inorder to protect ourselves and society. in the first case it is theindividual who for the sake of preserving himself or in order to sparehimself pain does injury with design: in the second case it is thestate. all ethic deems intentional infliction of injury justified bynecessity; that is when it is a matter of self preservation. but thesetwo points of view are sufficient to explain all bad acts done by man tomen. it is desired to obtain pleasure or avoid pain. in any sense it isa question always of self preservation. socrates and plato are right:whatever man does he always does right: that is does what seems to himgood advantageous according to the degree of advancement his intellecthas attained which is always the measure of his rational capacity.=the inoffensive in badness.=--badness has not for its object theinfliction of pain upon others but simply our own satisfaction as forinstance in the case of thirst for vengeance or of nerve excitation.every act of teasing shows what pleasure is caused by the display ofour power over others and what feelings of delight are experienced inthe sense of domination. is there then anything immoral in feelingpleasure in the pain of others is malicious joy devilish asschopenhauer says in the realm of nature we feel joy in breakingboughs shattering rocks fighting with wild beasts simply to attestour strength thereby. should not the knowledge that another suffers onour account here in this case make the same kind of act which bythe way arouses no qualms of conscience in us immoral also but if wehad not this knowledge there would be no pleasure in ones ownsuperiority or power for this pleasure is experienced only in thesuffering of another as in the case of teasing. all pleasure is initself neither good nor bad. whence comes the conviction that oneshould not cause pain in others in order to feel pleasure oneselfsimply from the standpoint of utility that is in consideration of theconsequences of ultimate pain since the injured party or state willdemand satisfaction and revenge. this consideration alone can have ledto the determination to renounce such pleasure.--sympathy has thesatisfaction of others in view no more than as already stated badnesshas the pain of others in view. for there are at least two perhaps manymore elementary ingredients in personal gratification which enterlargely into our self satisfaction: one of them being the pleasure ofthe emotion of which species is sympathy with tragedy and anotherwhen the impulse is to action being the pleasure of exercising onespower. should a sufferer be very dear to us we divest ourselves of painby the performance of acts of sympathy.--with the exception of some fewphilosophers men have placed sympathy very low in the rank of moralfeelings: and rightly.=self defence.=--if self defence is in general held a validjustification then nearly every manifestation of so called immoralegoism must be justified too. pain is inflicted robbery or killingdone in order to maintain life or to protect oneself and ward off harm.a man lies when cunning and delusion are valid means of selfpreservation. to injure intentionally when our safety and our existenceare involved or the continuance of our well being is conceded to bemoral. the state itself injures from this motive when it hangscriminals. in unintentional injury the immoral of course can not bepresent as accident alone is involved. but is there any sort ofintentional injury in which our existence and the maintenance of ourwell being be not involved is there such a thing as injuring fromabsolute badness for example in the case of cruelty if a man does notknow what pain an act occasions that act is not one of wickedness. thusthe child is not bad to the animal not evil. it disturbs and rends itas if it were one of its playthings. does a man ever fully know how muchpain an act may cause another as far as our nervous system extends weshield ourselves from pain. if it extended further that is to ourfellow men we would never cause anyone else any pain except in suchcases as we cause it to ourselves when we cut ourselves surgically toheal our ills or strive and trouble ourselves to gain health. weconclude from analogy that something pains somebody and can inconsequence through recollection and the power of imagination feelpain also. but what a difference there always is between the tooth acheand the pain sympathy that the spectacle of tooth ache occasions!therefore when injury is inflicted from so called badness the degree ofpain thereby experienced is always unknown to us: in so far however aspleasure is felt in the act a sense of ones own power of ones ownexcitation the act is committed to maintain the well being of theindividual and hence comes under the purview of self defence and lyingfor self preservation. without pleasure there is no life; the strugglefor pleasure is the struggle for life. whether the individual shallcarry on this struggle in such a way that he be called good or in such away that he be called bad is something that the standard and thecapacity of his own intellect must determine for him.=justice that rewards.=--whoever has fully understood the doctrine ofabsolute irresponsibility can no longer include the so called rewardingand punishing justice in the idea of justice if the latter be taken tomean that to each be given his due. for he who is punished does notdeserve the punishment. he is used simply as a means to intimidateothers from certain acts. equally he who is rewarded does not merit thereward. he could not act any differently than he did act. hence thereward has only the significance of an encouragement to him and othersas a motive for subsequent acts. the praise is called out only to himwho is running in the race and not to him who has arrived at the goal.something that comes to someone as his own is neither a punishment nor areward. it is given to him from utiliarian considerations without hishaving any claim to it in justice. hence one must say the wise manpraises not because a good act has been done precisely as was oncesaid: the wise man punishes not because a bad act has been done but inorder that a bad act may not be done. if punishment and reward ceasedthere would cease with them the most powerful incentives to certain actsand away from other acts. the purposes of men demand their continuanceof punishment and reward and inasmuch as punishment and reward blameand praise operate most potently upon vanity these same purposes of menimperatively require the continuance of vanity.=the water fall.=--at the sight of a water fall we may opine that in thecountless curves spirations and dashes of the waves we behold freedomof the will and of the impulses. but everything is compulsoryeverything can be mathematically calculated. thus it is too with humanacts. we would be able to calculate in advance every single action if wewere all knowing as well as every advance in knowledge every delusionevery bad deed. the acting individual himself is held fast in theillusion of volition. if on a sudden the entire movement of the worldstopped short and an all knowing and reasoning intelligence were thereto take advantage of this pause he could foretell the future of everybeing to the remotest ages and indicate the path that would be taken inthe worlds further course. the deception of the acting individual asregards himself the assumption of the freedom of the will is a part ofthis computable mechanism.=non-responsibility and non-guilt.=--the absolute irresponsibility ofman for his acts and his nature is the bitterest drop in the cup of himwho has knowledge if he be accustomed to behold in responsibility andduty the patent of nobility of his human nature. all his estimatespreferences dislikes are thus made worthless and false. his deepestsentiment with which he honored the sufferer the hero sprang from anerror. he may no longer praise no longer blame for it is irrational toblame and praise nature and necessity. just as he cherishes thebeautiful work of art but does not praise it as it is incapable ofdoing anything for itself just as he stands in the presence of plantshe must stand in the presence of human conduct his own included. he mayadmire strength beauty capacity therein but he can discern no merit.the chemical process and the conflict of the elements the ordeal ofthe invalid who strives for convalescence are no more merits than thesoul-struggles and extremities in which one is torn this way and that bycontending motives until one finally decides in favor of thestrongest--as the phrase has it although in fact it is the strongestmotive that decides for us. all these motives however whatever finenames we may give them have grown from the same roots in which webelieve the baneful poisons lurk. between good and bad actions there isno difference in kind but at most in degree. good acts are sublimatedevil. bad acts are degraded imbruted good. the very longing of theindividual for self gratification together with the fear of beingdeprived of it obtains satisfaction in all circumstances let theindividual act as he may that is as he must: be it in deeds of vanityrevenge pleasure utility badness cunning be it in deeds of selfsacrifice sympathy or knowledge. the degrees of rational capacitydetermine the direction in which this longing impels: every societyevery individual has constantly present a comparative classification ofbenefits in accordance with which conduct is determined and others arejudged. but this standard perpetually changes. many acts are called badthat are only stupid because the degree of intelligence that decidedfor them was low. indeed in a certain sense all acts now are stupidfor the highest degree of human intelligence that has yet been attainedwill in time most certainly be surpassed and then in retrospection allour present conduct and opinion will appear as narrow and petty as wenow deem the conduct and opinion of savage peoples and ages.--toperceive all these things may occasion profound pain but there isnevertheless a consolation. such pains are birth pains. the butterflyinsists upon breaking through the cocoon he presses through it tearsit to pieces only to be blinded and confused by the strange light bythe realm of liberty. by such men as are capable of this sadness--howfew there are!--will the first attempt be made to see if humanity mayconvert itself from a thing of morality to a thing of wisdom. the sun ofa new gospel sheds its first ray upon the loftiest height in the soulsof those few: but the clouds are massed there too thicker than everand not far apart are the brightest sunlight and the deepest gloom.everything is necessity--so says the new knowledge: and this knowledgeis itself necessity. all is guiltlessness and knowledge is the way toinsight into this guiltlessness. if pleasure egoism vanity benecessary to attest the moral phenomena and their richest blooms theinstinct for truth and accuracy of knowledge; if delusion and confusionof the imagination were the only means whereby mankind could graduallylift itself up to this degree of self enlightenment and selfemancipation--who would venture to disparage the means who would havethe right to feel sad if made aware of the goal to which those pathslead everything in the domain of ethic is evolved changeabletottering; all things flow it is true--but all things are also in thestream: to their goal. though within us the hereditary habit oferroneous judgment love hate may be ever dominant yet under theinfluence of awaking knowledge it will ever become weaker: a new habitthat of understanding not-loving not-hating looking from above growsup within us gradually and in the same soil and may perhaps inthousands of years be powerful enough to endow mankind with capacity todevelop the wise guiltless man conscious of guiltlessness asunfailingly as it now developes the unwise irrational guilt-consciousman--that is to say the necessary higher step not the opposite of it.the religious life.=the double contest against evil.=--if an evil afflicts us we can eitherso deal with it as to remove its cause or else so deal with it that itseffect upon our feeling is changed: hence look upon the evil as abenefit of which the uses will perhaps first become evident in somesubsequent period. religion and art and also the metaphysicalphilosophy strive to effect an alteration of the feeling partly by analteration of our judgment respecting the experience for example withthe aid of the dictum whom god loves he chastizes partly by theawakening of a joy in pain in emotion especially whence the art oftragedy had its origin. the more one is disposed to interpret away andjustify the less likely he is to look directly at the causes of eviland eliminate them. an instant alleviation and narcotizing of pain asis usual in the case of tooth ache is sufficient for him even in theseverest suffering. the more the domination of religions and of allnarcotic arts declines the more searchingly do men look to theelimination of evil itself which is a rather bad thing for the tragicpoets--for there is ever less and less material for tragedy since thedomain of unsparing immutable destiny grows constantly morecircumscribed--and a still worse thing for the priests for these lasthave lived heretofore upon the narcoticizing of human ill.=sorrow is knowledge.=--how willingly would not one exchange the falseassertions of the homines religiosi that there is a god who commands usto be good who is the sentinel and witness of every act every momentevery thought who loves us who plans our welfare in everymisfortune--how willingly would not one exchange these for truths ashealing beneficial and grateful as those delusions! but there are nosuch truths. philosophy can at most set up in opposition to them othermetaphysical plausibilities fundamental untruths as well. the tragedyof it all is that although one cannot believe these dogmas of religionand metaphysics if one adopts in heart and head the potent methods oftruth one has yet become through human evolution so tendersusceptible sensitive as to stand in need of the most effective meansof rest and consolation. from this state of things arises the dangerthat through the perception of truth or more accurately seeingthrough delusion one may bleed to death. byron has put this intodeathless verse:     sorrow is knowledge: they who know the most     must mourn the deepest oer the fatal truth     the tree of knowledge is not that of life.against such cares there is no better protective than the light fancy ofhorace at any rate during the darkest hours and sun eclipses of thesoul expressed in the words     quid aeternis minorem     consiliis animum fatigas     cur non sub alta vel platano vel hac     pinu jacentes. then wherefore should you who are mortal outwear     your soul with a profitless burden of care     say why should we not flung at ease neath this pine     or a plane-trees broad umbrage quaff gaily our wine                      translation of sir theodore martin.at any rate light fancy or heavy heartedness of any degree must bebetter than a romantic retrogression and desertion of ones flag anapproach to christianity in any form: for with it in the present stateof knowledge one can have nothing to do without hopelessly defilingones intellectual integrity and surrendering it unconditionally. thesewoes may be painful enough but without pain one cannot become a leaderand guide of humanity: and woe to him who would be such and lacks thispure integrity of the intellect!=the truth in religion.=--in the ages of enlightenment justice was notdone to the importance of religion of this there can be no doubt. it isalso equally certain that in the ensuing reaction of enlightenment thedemands of justice were far exceeded inasmuch as religion was treatedwith love even with infatuation and proclaimed as a profound indeedthe most profound knowledge of the world which science had but todivest of its dogmatic garb in order to possess truth in itsunmythical form. religions must therefore--this was the contention ofall foes of enlightenment--sensu allegorico with regard for thecomprehension of the masses give expression to that ancient truth whichis wisdom in itself inasmuch as all science of modern times has led upto it instead of away from it. so that between the most ancient wisdomof man and all later wisdom there prevails harmony even similarity ofviewpoint; and the advancement of knowledge--if one be disposed toconcede such a thing--has to do not with its nature but with itspropagation. this whole conception of religion and science is throughand through erroneous and none would to-day be hardy enough tocountenance it had not schopenhauers rhetoric taken it underprotection this high sounding rhetoric which now gains auditors afterthe lapse of a generation. much as may be gained from schopenhauersreligio-ethical human and cosmical oracle as regards the comprehensionof christianity and other religions it is nevertheless certain that heerred regarding the value of religion to knowledge. he himself was inthis but a servile pupil of the scientific teachers of his time who hadall taken romanticism under their protection and renounced the spirit ofenlightenment. had he been born in our own time it would have beenimpossible for him to have spoken of the sensus allegoricus of religion.he would instead have done truth the justice to say: never has areligion directly or indirectly either as dogma or as allegorycontained a truth. for all religions grew out of dread or necessity andcame into existence through an error of the reason. they have perhapsin times of danger from science incorporated some philosophicaldoctrine or other into their systems in order to make it possible tocontinue ones existence within them. but this is but a theological workof art dating from the time in which a religion began to doubt ofitself. these theological feats of art which are most common inchristianity as the religion of a learned age impregnated withphilosophy have led to this superstition of the sensus allegoricus ashas even more the habit of the philosophers namely thosehalf-natures the poetical philosophers and the philosophising artistsof dealing with their own feelings as if they constituted thefundamental nature of humanity and hence of giving their own religiousfeelings a predominant influence over the structure of their systems. asthe philosophers mostly philosophised under the influence of hereditaryreligious habits or at least under the traditional influence of thismetaphysical necessity they naturally arrived at conclusionsclosely resembling the judaic or christian or indian religioustenets--resembling in the way that children are apt to look like theirmothers: only in this case the fathers were not certain as to thematernity as easily happens--but in the innocence of their admirationthey fabled regarding the family likeness of all religion and science.in reality there exists between religion and true science neitherrelationship nor friendship not even enmity: they dwell in differentspheres. every philosophy that lets the religious comet gleam throughthe darkness of its last outposts renders everything within it thatpurports to be science suspicious. it is all probably religionalthough it may assume the guise of science.--moreover though all thepeoples agree concerning certain religious things for example theexistence of a god which by the way as regards this point is notthe case this fact would constitute an argument against the thingagreed upon for example the very existence of a god. the consensusgentium and especially hominum can probably amount only to an absurdity.against it there is no consensus omnium sapientium whatever on anypoint with the exception of which goethes verse speaks:     all greatest sages to all latest ages         will smile wink and slily agree     tis folly to wait till a fools empty pate         has learned to be knowing and free.     so children of wisdom must look upon fools     as creatures whore never the better for schools.stated without rhyme or metre and adapted to our case: the consensussapientium is to the effect that the consensus gentium amounts to anabsurdity.=origin of religious worship.=--let us transport ourselves back to thetimes in which religious life flourished most vigorously and we willfind a fundamental conviction prevalent which we no longer share andwhich has resulted in the closing of the door to religious life once forall so far as we are concerned: this conviction has to do with natureand intercourse with her. in those times nothing is yet known ofnatures laws. neither for earth nor for heaven is there a must. aseason sunshine rain can come or stay away as it pleases. there iswanting in particular all idea of natural causation. if a man rows itis not the oar that moves the boat but rowing is a magical ceremonywhereby a demon is constrained to move the boat. all illness deathitself is a consequence of magical influences. in sickness and deathnothing natural is conceived. the whole idea of natural course iswanting. the idea dawns first upon the ancient greeks that is to say ina very late period of humanity in the conception of a moira fateruling over the gods. if any person shoots off a bow there is always anirrational strength and agency in the act. if the wells suddenly rundry the first thought is of subterranean demons and their pranks. itmust have been the dart of a god beneath whose invisible influence ahuman being suddenly collapses. in india the carpenter according tolubbock is in the habit of making devout offerings to his hammer andhatchet. a brahmin treats the plume with which he writes a soldier theweapon that he takes into the field a mason his trowel a laborer hisplow in the same way. all nature is in the opinion of religiouspeople a sum total of the doings of conscious and willing beings animmense mass of complex volitions. in regard to all that takes placeoutside of us no conclusion is permissible that anything will resultthus and so must result thus and so that we are comparativelycalculable and certain in our experiences that man is the rule naturethe ruleless. this view forms the fundamental conviction that dominatescrude religion-producing early civilizations. we contemporary men feelexactly the opposite: the richer man now feels himself inwardly themore polyphone the music and the sounding of his soul the morepowerfully does the uniformity of nature impress him. we all withgoethe recognize in nature the great means of repose for the soul. welisten to the pendulum stroke of this great clock with longing for restfor absolute calm and quiescence as if we could drink in the uniformityof nature and thereby arrive first at an enjoyment of oneself. formerlyit was the reverse: if we carry ourselves back to the periods of crudecivilization or if we contemplate contemporary savages we will findthem most strongly influenced by rule by tradition. the individual isalmost automatically bound to rule and tradition and moves with theuniformity of a pendulum. to him nature--the uncomprehended fearfulmysterious nature--must seem the domain of freedom of volition ofhigher power indeed as an ultra-human degree of destiny as god. everyindividual in such periods and circumstances feels that his existencehis happiness the existence and happiness of the family the statethe success or failure of every undertaking must depend upon thesedispositions of nature. certain natural events must occur at the propertime and certain others must not occur. how can influence be exercisedover this fearful unknown how can this domain of freedom be broughtunder subjection thus he asks himself thus he worries: is there nomeans to render these powers of nature as subject to rule and traditionas you are yourself--the cogitation of the superstitious andmagic-deluded man is upon the theme of imposing a law upon nature: andto put it briefly religious worship is the result of such cogitation.the problem which is present to every man is closely connected with thisone: how can the weaker party dictate laws to the stronger control itsacts in reference to the weaker at first the most harmless form ofinfluence is recollected that influence which is acquired when thepartiality of anyone has been won. through beseeching and prayerthrough abject humiliation through obligations to regular gifts andpropitiations through flattering homages it is possible therefore toimpose some guidance upon the forces of nature to the extent that theirpartiality be won: love binds and is bound. then agreements can beentered into by means of which certain courses of conduct are mutuallyconcluded vows are made and authorities prescribed. but far more potentis that species of power exercised by means of magic and incantation. asa man is able to injure a powerful enemy by means of the magician andrender him helpless with fear as the love potion operates at adistance so can the mighty forces of nature in the opinion of weakermankind be controlled by similar means. the principal means ofeffecting incantations is to acquire control of something belonging tothe party to be influenced hair finger nails food from his tableeven his picture or his name. with such apparatus it is possible to actby means of magic for the basic principle is that to everythingspiritual corresponds something corporeal. with the aid of thiscorporeal element the spirit may be bound injured or destroyed. thecorporeal affords the handle by which the spiritual can be laid hold of.in the same way that man influences mankind does he influences somespirit of nature for this latter has also its corporeal element thatcan be grasped. the tree and on the same basis the seed from which itgrew: this puzzling sequence seems to demonstrate that in both forms thesame spirit is embodied now large now small. a stone that suddenlyrolls is the body in which the spirit works. does a huge boulder lie ina lonely moor it is impossible to think of mortal power having placedit there. the stone must have moved itself there. that is to say somespirit must dominate it. everything that has a body is subject to magicincluding therefore the spirits of nature. if a god is directlyconnected with his portrait a direct influence by refraining fromdevout offerings by whippings chainings and the like can be broughtto bear upon him. the lower classes in china tie cords around thepicture of their god in order to defy his departing favor when he hasleft them in the lurch and tear the picture to pieces drag it throughthe streets into dung heaps and gutters crying: you dog of a spiritwe housed you in a beautiful temple we gilded you prettily we fed youwell we brought you offerings and yet how ungrateful you are! similardisplays of resentment have been made against pictures of the mother ofgod and pictures of saints in catholic countries during the presentcentury when such pictures would not do their duty during times ofpestilence and drought.through all these magical relationships to nature countless ceremoniesare occasioned and finally when their complexity and confusion growtoo great pains are taken to systematize them to arrange them so thatthe favorable course of natures progress namely the great yearlycircle of the seasons may be brought about by a corresponding course ofthe ceremonial progress. the aim of religious worship is to influencenature to human advantage and hence to instil a subjection to law intoher that originally she has not whereas at present man desires to findout the subjection to law of nature in order to guide himself thereby.in brief the system of religious worship rests upon the idea of magicbetween man and man and the magician is older than the priest. but itrests equally upon other and higher ideas. it brings into prominence thesympathetic relation of man to man the existence of benevolencegratitude prayer of truces between enemies of loans upon security ofarrangements for the protection of property. man even in very inferiordegrees of civilization does not stand in the presence of nature as ahelpless slave he is not willy-nilly the absolute servant of nature. inthe greek development of religion especially in the relationship to theolympian gods it becomes possible to entertain the idea of an existenceside by side of two castes a higher more powerful and a lower lesspowerful: but both are bound together in some way on account of theirorigin and are one species. they need not be ashamed of one another.this is the element of distinction in greek religion.=at the contemplation of certain ancient sacrificial proceedings.=--howmany sentiments are lost to us is manifest in the union of the farcicaleven of the obscene with the religious feeling. the feeling that thismixture is possible is becoming extinct. we realize the mixture onlyhistorically in the mysteries of demeter and dionysos and in thechristian easter festivals and religious mysteries. but we stillperceive the sublime in connection with the ridiculous and the likethe emotional with the absurd. perhaps a later age will be unable tounderstand even these combinations.=christianity as antiquity.=--when on a sunday morning we hear the oldbells ringing we ask ourselves: is it possible all this for a jewcrucified two thousand years ago who said he was gods son the proof ofsuch an assertion is lacking.--certainly the christian religionconstitutes in our time a protruding bit of antiquity from very remoteages and that its assertions are still generally believed--although menhave become so keen in the scrutiny of claims--constitutes the oldestrelic of this inheritance. a god who begets children by a mortal woman;a sage who demands that no more work be done that no more justice beadministered but that the signs of the approaching end of the world beheeded; a system of justice that accepts an innocent as a vicarioussacrifice in the place of the guilty; a person who bids his disciplesdrink his blood; prayers for miracles; sins against a god expiated upona god; fear of a hereafter to which death is the portal; the figure ofthe cross as a symbol in an age that no longer knows the purpose and theignominy of the cross--how ghostly all these things flit before us outof the grave of their primitive antiquity! is one to believe that suchthings can still be believed=the un-greek in christianity.=--the greeks did not look upon thehomeric gods above them as lords nor upon themselves beneath asservants after the fashion of the jews. they saw but the counterpart asin a mirror of the most perfect specimens of their own caste hence anideal but no contradiction of their own nature. there was a feeling ofmutual relationship resulting in a mutual interest a sort of alliance.man thinks well of himself when he gives himself such gods and placeshimself in a relationship akin to that of the lower nobility with thehigher; whereas the italian races have a decidedly vulgar religioninvolving perpetual anxiety because of bad and mischievous powers andsoul disturbers. wherever the olympian gods receded into the backgroundthere even greek life became gloomier and more perturbed.--christianityon the other hand oppressed and degraded humanity completely and sankit into deepest mire: into the feeling of utter abasement it suddenlyflashed the gleam of divine compassion so that the amazed andgrace-dazzled stupefied one gave a cry of delight and for a momentbelieved that the whole of heaven was within him. upon this unhealthyexcess of feeling upon the accompanying corruption of heart and headchristianity attains all its psychological effects. it wants toannihilate debase stupefy amaze bedazzle. there is but one thingthat it does not want: measure standard das maas and therefore is itin the worst sense barbarous asiatic vulgar un-greek.=being religious to some purpose.=--there are certain insipidtraffic-virtuous people to whom religion is pinned like the hem of somegarb of a higher humanity. these people do well to remain religious: itadorns them. all who are not versed in some professionalweapon--including tongue and pen as weapons--are servile: to all suchthe christian religion is very useful for then their servility assumesthe aspect of christian virtue and is amazingly adorned.--people whosedaily lives are empty and colorless are readily religious. this iscomprehensible and pardonable but they have no right to demand thatothers whose daily lives are not empty and colorless should bereligious also.=the everyday christian.=--if christianity with its allegations of anavenging god universal sinfulness choice of grace and the danger ofeternal damnation were true it would be an indication of weakness ofmind and character not to be a priest or an apostle or a hermit andtoil for ones own salvation. it would be irrational to lose sight ofones eternal well being in comparison with temporary advantage:assuming these dogmas to be generally believed the every day christianis a pitiable figure a man who really cannot count as far as three andwho for the rest just because of his intellectual incapacity does notdeserve to be as hard punished as christianity promises he shall be.=concerning the cleverness of christianity.=--it is a master stroke ofchristianity to so emphasize the unworthiness sinfulness anddegradation of men in general that contempt of ones fellow creaturesbecomes impossible. he may sin as much as he pleases he is not bynature different from me. it is i who in every way am unworthy andcontemptible. so says the christian to himself. but even this feelinghas lost its keenest sting for the christian does not believe in hisindividual degradation. he is bad in his general human capacity and hesoothes himself a little with the assertion that we are all alike.=personal change.=--as soon as a religion rules it has for itsopponents those who were its first disciples.=fate of christianity.=--christianity arose to lighten the heart butnow it must first make the heart heavy in order to be able to lighten itafterwards. christianity will consequently go down.=the testimony of pleasure.=--the agreeable opinion is accepted as true.this is the testimony of pleasure or as the church says the evidenceof strength of which all religions are so proud although they shouldall be ashamed of it. if a belief did not make blessed it would not bebelieved. how little it would be worth then!=dangerous play.=--whoever gives religious feeling room must then alsolet it grow. he can do nothing else. then his being gradually changes.the religious element brings with it affinities and kinships. the wholecircle of his judgment and feeling is clouded and draped in religiousshadows. feeling cannot stand still. one should be on ones guard.=the blind pupil.=--as long as one knows very well the strength and theweakness of ones dogma ones art ones religion its strength isstill low. the pupil and apostle who has no eye for the weaknesses of adogma a religion and so on dazzled by the aspect of the master and byhis own reverence for him has on that very account generally morepower than the master. without blind pupils the influence of a man andhis work has never become great. to give victory to knowledge oftenamounts to no more than so allying it with stupidity that the bruteforce of the latter forces triumph for the former.=the breaking off of churches.=--there is not sufficient religion in theworld merely to put an end to the number of religions.=sinlessness of men.=--if one have understood how sin came into theworld namely through errors of the reason through which men in theirintercourse with one another and even individual men looked uponthemselves as much blacker and wickeder than was really the case oneswhole feeling is much lightened and man and the world appear together insuch a halo of harmlessness that a sentiment of well being is instilledinto ones whole nature. man in the midst of nature is as a child leftto its own devices. this child indeed dreams a heavy anxious dream. butwhen it opens its eyes it finds itself always in paradise.=irreligiousness of artists.=--homer is so much at home among his godsand is as a poet so good natured to them that he must have beenprofoundly irreligious. that which was brought to him by the popularfaith--a mean crude and partially repulsive superstition--he dealt withas freely as the sculptor with his clay therefore with the same freedomthat ã†schylus and aristophanes evinced and with which in later times thegreat artists of the renaissance and also shakespeare and goethe drewtheir pictures.=art and strength of false interpretation.=--all the visions fearsexhaustions and delights of the saint are well known symptoms ofsickness which in him owing to deep rooted religious and psychologicaldelusions are explained quite differently that is not as symptoms ofsickness.--so too perhaps the demon of socrates was nothing but amalady of the ear that he explained in view of his predominant moraltheory in a manner different from what would be thought rationalto-day. nor is the case different with the frenzy and the frenziedspeeches of the prophets and of the priests of the oracles. it is alwaysthe degree of wisdom imagination capacity and morality in the heartand mind of the interpreters that got so much out of them. it is amongthe greatest feats of the men who are called geniuses and saints thatthey made interpreters for themselves who fortunately for mankind didnot understand them.=reverence for madness.=--because it was perceived that an excitement ofsome kind often made the head clearer and occasioned fortunateinspirations it was concluded that the utmost excitement would occasionthe most fortunate inspirations. hence the frenzied being was revered asa sage and an oracle giver. a false conclusion lies at the bottom of allthis.=promises of wisdom.=--modern science has as its object as little painas possible as long a life as possible--hence a sort of eternalblessedness but of a very limited kind in comparison with the promisesof religion.=forbidden generosity.=--there is not enough of love and goodness in theworld to throw any of it away on conceited people.=survival of religious training in the disposition.=--the catholicchurch and before it all ancient education controlled the whole domainof means through which man was put into certain unordinary moods andwithdrawn from the cold calculation of personal advantage and from calmrational reflection. a church vibrating with deep tones; gloomyregular restraining exhortations from a priestly band whoinvoluntarily communicate their own tension to their congregation andlead them to listen almost with anxiety as if some miracle were incourse of preparation; the awesome pile of architecture which as thehouse of a god rears itself vastly into the vague and in all itsshadowy nooks inspires fear of its nerve-exciting power--who would careto reduce men to the level of these things if the ideas upon which theyrest became extinct but the results of all these things arenevertheless not thrown away: the inner world of exalted emotionalprophetic profoundly repentant hope-blessed moods has become inborn inman largely through cultivation. what still exists in his soul wasformerly as he germinated grew and bloomed thoroughly disciplined.=religious after-pains.=--though one believe oneself absolutely weanedaway from religion the process has yet not been so thorough as to makeimpossible a feeling of joy at the presence of religious feelings anddispositions without intelligible content as for example in music;and if a philosophy alleges to us the validity of metaphysical hopesthrough the peace of soul therein attainable and also speaks of thewhole true gospel in the look of raphaels madonna we greet suchdeclarations and innuendoes with a welcome smile. the philosopher hashere a matter easy of demonstration. he responds with that which he isglad to give namely a heart that is glad to accept. hence it isobservable how the less reflective free spirits collide only with dogmasbut yield readily to the magic of religious feelings; it is a source ofpain to them to let the latter go simply on account of theformer.--scientific philosophy must be very much on its guard lest onaccount of this necessity--an evolved and hence also a transitorynecessity--delusions are smuggled in. even logicians speak ofpresentiments of truth in ethics and in art for example of thepresentiment that the essence of things is unity a thing whichnevertheless ought to be prohibited. between carefully deduced truthsand such foreboded things there lies the abysmal distinction that theformer are products of the intellect and the latter of the necessity.hunger is no evidence that there is food at hand to appease it. hungermerely craves food. presentiment does not denote that the existence ofa thing is known in any way whatever. it denotes merely that it isdeemed possible to the extent that it is desired or feared. thepresentiment is not one step forward in the domain of certainty.--itis involuntarily believed that the religious tinted sections of aphilosophy are better attested than the others but the case is atbottom just the opposite: there is simply the inner wish that it may beso that the thing which beautifies may also be true. this wish leads usto accept bad grounds as good.=of the christian need of salvation.=--careful consideration must renderit possible to propound some explanation of that process in the soul ofa christian which is termed need of salvation and to propound anexplanation too free from mythology: hence one purely psychological.heretofore psychological explanations of religious conditions andprocesses have really been in disrepute inasmuch as a theology callingitself free gave vent to its unprofitable nature in this domain; for itsprincipal aim so far as may be judged from the spirit of its creatorschleier-macher was the preservation of the christian religion and themaintenance of the christian theology. it appeared that in thepsychological analysis of religious facts a new anchorage and aboveall a new calling were to be gained. undisturbed by such predecessorswe venture the following exposition of the phenomena alluded to. man isconscious of certain acts which are very firmly implanted in the generalcourse of conduct: indeed he discovers in himself a predisposition tosuch acts that seems to him to be as unalterable as his very being. howgladly he would essay some other kind of acts which in the generalestimate of conduct are rated the best and highest how gladly he wouldwelcome the consciousness of well doing which ought to follow unselfishmotive! unfortunately however it goes no further than this longing:the discontent consequent upon being unable to satisfy it is added toall other kinds of discontent which result from his life destiny inparticular or which may be due to so called bad acts; so that a deepdepression ensues accompanied by a desire for some physician to removeit and all its causes.--this condition would not be found so bitter ifthe individual but compared himself freely with other men: for then hewould have no reason to be discontented with himself in particular as heis merely bearing his share of the general burden of human discontentand incompleteness. but he compares himself with a being who alone mustbe capable of the conduct that is called unegoistic and of an enduringconsciousness of unselfish motive with god. it is because he gazes intothis clear mirror that his own self seems so extraordinarily distractedand so troubled. thereupon the thought of that being in so far as itflits before his fancy as retributive justice occasions him anxiety. inevery conceivable small and great experience he believes he sees theanger of the being his threats the very implements and manacles of hisjudge and prison. what succors him in this danger which in theprospect of an eternal duration of punishment transcends in hideousnessall the horrors that can be presented to the imaginationbefore we consider this condition in its further effects we would admitto ourselves that man is betrayed into this condition not through hisfault and sin but through a series of delusions of the reason; thatit was the fault of the mirror if his own self appeared to him in thehighest degree dark and hateful and that that mirror was his own workthe very imperfect work of human imagination and judgment. in the firstplace a being capable of absolutely unegoistic conduct is as fabulous asthe phoenix. such a being is not even thinkable for the very reason thatthe whole notion of unegoistic conduct when closely examinedvanishes into air. never yet has a man done anything solely for othersand entirely without reference to a personal motive; indeed how could hepossibly do anything that had no reference to himself that is withoutinward compulsion which must always have its basis in a personal needhow could the ego act without ego--a god who on the other hand isall love as he is usually represented would not be capable of asolitary unegoistic act: whence one is reminded of a reflection oflichtenbergs which is in truth taken from a lower sphere: we cannotpossibly feel for others as the expression goes; we feel only forourselves. the assertion sounds hard but it is not if rightlyunderstood. a man loves neither his father nor his mother nor his wifenor his child but simply the feelings which they inspire. or as larochefoucauld says: if you think you love your mistress for the merelove of her you are very much mistaken. why acts of love are morehighly prized than others namely not on account of their nature but onaccount of their utility has already been explained in the section onthe origin of moral feelings. but if a man should wish to be all lovelike the god aforesaid and want to do all things for others and nothingfor himself the procedure would be fundamentally impossible because he_must_ do a great deal for himself before there would be any possibilityof doing anything for the love of others. it is also essential thatothers be sufficiently egoistic to accept always and at all times thisself sacrifice and living for others so that the men of love and selfsacrifice have an interest in the survival of unloving and selfishegoists while the highest morality in order to maintain itself mustformally enforce the existence of immorality wherein it would be reallydestroying itself.--further: the idea of a god perturbs and discouragesas long as it is accepted but as to how it originated can no longer inthe present state of comparative ethnological science be a matter ofdoubt and with the insight into the origin of this belief all faithcollapses. what happens to the christian who compares his nature withthat of god is exactly what happened to don quixote who depreciated hisown prowess because his head was filled with the wondrous deeds of theheroes of chivalrous romance. the standard of measurement which bothemploy belongs to the domain of fable.--but if the idea of godcollapses so too does the feeling of sin as a violation of divinerescript as a stain upon a god-like creation. there still apparentlyremains that discouragement which is closely allied with fear of thepunishment of worldly justice or of the contempt of ones fellow men.the keenest thorn in the sentiment of sin is dulled when it is perceivedthat ones acts have contravened human tradition human rules and humanlaws without having thereby endangered the eternal salvation of thesoul and its relations with deity. if finally men attain to theconviction of the absolute necessity of all acts and of their utterirresponsibility and then absorb it into their flesh and blood everyrelic of conscience pangs will disappear.if now as stated the christian through certain delusive feelings isbetrayed into self contempt that is by a false and unscientific view ofhis acts and feelings he must nevertheless perceive with the utmostamazement that this state of self contempt of conscience pangs ofdespair in particular does not last that there are hours during whichall these things are wafted away from the soul and he feels himself oncemore free and courageous. the truth is that joy in his own being thefulness of his own powers in connection with the inevitable decline ofhis profound excitation with the lapse of time bore off the palm ofvictory. the man loves himself once more he feels it--but this very newlove this new self esteem seems to him incredible. he can see in itonly the wholly unmerited stream of the light of grace shed down uponhim. if he formerly saw in every event merely warnings threatspunishments and every kind of indication of divine anger he now readsinto his experiences the grace of god. the latter circumstance seems tohim full of love the former as a helpful pointing of the way and hisentirely joyful frame of mind now seems to him to be an absolute proofof the goodness of god. as formerly in his states of discouragement heinterpreted his conduct falsely so now he does the same with hisexperiences. his state of consolation is now regarded as the effectproduced by some external power. the love with which at bottom heloves himself seems to be the divine love. that which he calls graceand the preliminary of salvation is in reality self-graceself-salvation.therefore a certain false psychology a certain kind of imaginativenessin the interpretation of motives and experiences is the essentialpreliminary to being a christian and to experiencing the need ofsalvation. upon gaining an insight into this wandering of the reason andthe imagination one ceases to be a christian.=of christian asceticism and sanctity.=--much as some thinkers haveexerted themselves to impart an air of the miraculous to those singularphenomena known as asceticism and sanctity to question which or toaccount for which upon a rational basis would be wickedness andsacrilege the temptation to this wickedness is none the less great. apowerful impulse of nature has in every age led to protest against suchphenomena. at any rate science inasmuch as it is the imitation ofnature permits the casting of doubts upon the inexplicable characterand the supernal degree of such phenomena. it is true that heretoforescience has not succeeded in its attempts at explanation. the phenomenaremain unexplained still to the great satisfaction of those who reveremoral miracles. for speaking generally the unexplained must rank asthe inexplicable the inexplicable as the non-natural supernaturalmiraculous--so runs the demand in the souls of all the religious and allthe metaphysicians even the artists if they happen to be thinkerswhereas the scientific man sees in this demand the evilprinciple.--the universal first apparent truth that is encountered inthe contemplation of sanctity and asceticism is that their nature iscomplicated; for nearly always within the physical world as well as inthe moral the apparently miraculous may be traced successfully to thecomplex the obscure the multi-conditioned. let us venture then toisolate a few impulses in the soul of the saint and the ascetic toconsider them separately and then view them as a synthetic development.there is an obstinacy against oneself certain sublimated forms of whichare included in asceticism. certain kinds of men are under such a strongnecessity of exercising their power and dominating impulses that ifother objects are lacking or if they have not succeeded with otherobjects they will actually tyrannize over some portions of their ownnature or over sections and stages of their own personality. thus domany thinkers bring themselves to views which are far from likely toincrease or improve their fame. many deliberately bring down thecontempt of others upon themselves although they could easily haveretained consideration by silence. others contradict earlier opinionsand do not shrink from the ordeal of being deemed inconsistent. on thecontrary they strive for this and act like eager riders who enjoyhorseback exercise most when the horse is skittish. thus will men indangerous paths ascend to the highest steeps in order to laugh to scorntheir own fear and their own trembling limbs. thus will the philosopherembrace the dogmas of asceticism humility sanctity in the light ofwhich his own image appears in its most hideous aspect. this crushing ofself this mockery of ones own nature this spernere se sperni out ofwhich religions have made so much is in reality but a very highdevelopment of vanity. the whole ethic of the sermon on the mountbelongs in this category: man has a true delight in mastering himselfthrough exaggerated pretensions or excessive expedients and laterdeifying this tyrannically exacting something within him. in everyscheme of ascetic ethics man prays to one part of himself as if it weregod and hence it is necessary for him to treat the rest of himself asdevil.=man is not at all hours equally moral=; this is established. if onesmorality be judged according to ones capacity for great selfsacrificing resolutions and abnegations which when continual and madea habit are known as sanctity one is in affection or disposition themost moral: while higher excitement supplies wholly new impulses whichwere one calm and cool as ordinarily one would not deem oneself evencapable of. how comes this apparently from the propinquity of all greatand lofty emotional states. if a man is brought to an extraordinarypitch of feeling he can resolve upon a fearful revenge or upon a fearfulrenunciation of his thirst for vengeance indifferently. he craves underthe influences of powerful emotion the great the powerful theimmense and if he chances to perceive that the sacrifice of himselfwill afford him as much satisfaction as the sacrifice of another orwill afford him more he will choose self sacrifice. what concerns himparticularly is simply the unloading of his emotion. hence he readilyto relieve his tension grasps the darts of the enemy and buries them inhis own breast. that in self abnegation and not in revenge the elementof greatness consisted must have been brought home to mankind only afterlong habituation. a god who sacrifices himself would be the mostpowerful and most effective symbol of this sort of greatness. as theconquest of the most hardly conquered enemy the sudden mastering of apassion--thus does such abnegation _appear_: hence it passes for thesummit of morality. in reality all that is involved is the exchange ofone idea for another whilst the temperament remained at a like altitudea like tidal state. men when coming out of the spell or resting fromsuch passionate excitation no longer understand the morality of suchinstants but the admiration of all who participated in the occasionsustains them. pride is their support if the passion and thecomprehension of their act weaken. therefore at bottom even such actsof self-abnegation are not moral inasmuch as they are not done with astrict regard for others. rather do others afford the high strungtemperament an opportunity to lighten itself through such abnegation.=even the ascetic seeks to make life easier= and generally by means ofabsolute subjection to another will or to an all inclusive rule andritual pretty much as the brahmin leaves absolutely nothing to his ownvolition but is guided in every moment of his life by some holyinjunction or other. this subjection is a potent means of acquiringdominion over oneself. one is occupied hence time does not bang heavyand there is no incitement of the personal will and of the individualpassion. the deed once done there is no feeling of responsibility northe sting of regret. one has given up ones own will once for all andthis is easier than to give it up occasionally as it is also easierwholly to renounce a desire than to yield to it in measured degree. whenwe consider the present relation of man to the state we perceiveunconditional obedience is easier than conditional. the holy person alsomakes his lot easier through the complete surrender of his lifepersonality and it is all delusion to admire such a phenomenon as theloftiest heroism of morality. it is always more difficult to assertones personality without shrinking and without hesitation than to giveit up altogether in the manner indicated and it requires moreover moreintellect and thought.after having discovered in many of the less comprehensible actions meremanifestations of pleasure in emotion for its own sake i fancy i candetect in the self contempt which characterises holy persons and alsoin their acts of self torture through hunger and scourgingsdistortions and chaining of the limbs acts of madness simply a meanswhereby such natures may resist the general exhaustion of their will tolive their nerves. they employ the most painful expedients to escapeif only for a time from the heaviness and weariness in which they aresteeped by their great mental indolence and their subjection to a willother than their own.=the most usual means= by which the ascetic and the sanctifiedindividual seeks to make life more endurable comprises certain combatsof an inner nature involving alternations of victory and prostration.for this purpose an enemy is necessary and he is found in the so calledinner enemy. that is the holy individual makes use of his tendency tovanity domineering and pride and of his mental longings in order tocontemplate his life as a sort of continuous battle and himself as abattlefield in which good and evil spirits wage war with varyingfortune. it is an established fact that the imagination is restrainedthrough the regularity and adequacy of sexual intercourse while on theother hand abstention from or great irregularity in sexual intercoursewill cause the imagination to run riot. the imaginations of many of thechristian saints were obscene to a degree; and because of the theorythat sexual desires were in reality demons that raged within them thesaints did not feel wholly responsible for them. it is to thisconviction that we are indebted for the highly instructive sincerity oftheir evidence against themselves. it was to their interest that thiscontest should always be kept up in some fashion because by means ofthis contest as already stated their empty lives gained distraction.in order that the contest might seem sufficiently great to inspiresympathy and admiration in the unsanctified it was essential thatsexual capacity be ever more and more damned and denounced. indeed thedanger of eternal damnation was so closely allied to this capacity thatfor whole generations christians showed their children with actualconscience pangs. what evil may not have been done to humanity throughthis! and yet here the truth is just upside down: an exceedinglyunseemly attitude for the truth. christianity it is true had said thatevery man is conceived and born in sin and in the intolerable andexcessive christianity of calderon this thought is again perverted andentangled into the most distorted paradox extant in the well known lines     the greatest sin of man     is the sin of being born.in all pessimistic religions the act of procreation is looked upon asevil in itself. this is far from being the general human opinion. it isnot even the opinion of all pessimists. empedocles for example knowsnothing of anything shameful devilish and sinful in it. he sees ratherin the great field of bliss of unholiness simply a healthful and hopefulphenomenon aphrodite. she is to him an evidence that strife does notalways rage but that some time a gentle demon is to wield the sceptre.the christian pessimists of practice had as stated a direct interestin the prevalence of an opposite belief. they needed in the lonelinessand the spiritual wilderness of their lives an ever living enemy and auniversally known enemy through whose conquest they might appear to theunsanctified as utterly incomprehensible and half unnatural beings. whenthis enemy at last as a result of their mode of life and theirshattered health took flight forever they were able immediately topeople their inner selves with new demons. the rise and fall of thebalance of cheerfulness and despair maintained their addled brains in atotally new fluctuation of longing and peace of soul. and in that periodpsychology served not only to cast suspicion on everything human but towound and scourge it to crucify it. man wanted to find himself as baseand evil as possible. man sought to become anxious about the state ofhis soul he wished to be doubtful of his own capacity. everythingnatural with which man connects the idea of badness and sinfulness asfor instance is still customary in regard to the erotic injures anddegrades the imagination occasions a shamed aspect leads man to warupon himself and makes him uncertain distrustful of himself. even hisdreams acquire a tincture of the unclean conscience. and yet thissuffering because of the natural element in certain things is whollysuperfluous. it is simply the result of opinions regarding the things.it is easy to understand why men become worse than they are if they arebrought to look upon the unavoidably natural as bad and later to feel itas of evil origin. it is the master stroke of religions and metaphysicsthat wish to make man out bad and sinful by nature to render naturesuspicious in his eyes and to so make himself evil for he learns tofeel himself evil when he cannot divest himself of nature. he graduallycomes to look upon himself after a long life lived naturally sooppressed by a weight of sin that supernatural powers become necessaryto relieve him of the burden; and with this notion comes the so calledneed of salvation which is the result not of a real but of an imaginarysinfulness. go through the separate moral expositions in the vouchers ofchristianity and it will always be found that the demands are excessivein order that it may be impossible for man to satisfy them. the objectis not that he may become moral but that he may feel as sinful aspossible. if this feeling had not been rendered agreeable to man--whyshould he have improvised such an ideal and clung to it so long as inthe ancient world an incalculable strength of intellect and capacity forfeeling was squandered in order to increase the joy of living throughfeastful systems of worship so in the era of christianity an equallyincalculable quantity of intellectual capacity has been sacrificed inanother endeavor: that man should in every way feel himself sinful andthereby be moved inspired inspirited. to move to inspire to inspiritat any cost--is not this the freedom cry of an exhausted over-ripeover cultivated age the circle of all the natural sensations had beengone through a hundred times: the soul had grown weary. then the saintsand the ascetics found a new order of ecstacies. they set themselvesbefore the eyes of all not alone as models for imitation to many but asfearful and yet delightful spectacles on the boundary line between thisworld and the next world where in that period everyone thought he sawat one time rays of heavenly light at another fearful threateningtongues of flame. the eye of the saint directed upon the fearfulsignificance of the shortness of earthly life upon the imminence of thelast judgment upon eternal life hereafter; this glowering eye in anemaciated body caused men in the old time world to tremble to thedepths of their being. to look to look away and shudder to feel anewthe fascination of the spectacle to yield to it sate oneself upon ituntil the soul trembled with ardor and fever--that was the last pleasureleft to classical antiquity when its sensibilities had been blunted bythe arena and the gladiatorial show.=to sum up all that has been said=: that condition of soul at which thesaint or expectant saint is rejoiced is a combination of elements whichwe are all familiar with except that under other influences than thoseof mere religious ideation they customarily arouse the censure of men inthe same way that when combined with religion itself and regarded as thesupreme attainment of sanctity they are object of admiration and evenof prayer--at least in more simple times. very soon the saint turns uponhimself that severity that is so closely allied to the instinct ofdomination at any price and which inspire even in the most solitaryindividual the sense of power. soon his swollen sensitiveness of feelingbreaks forth from the longing to restrain his passions within it and istransformed into a longing to master them as if they were wild steedsthe master impulse being ever that of a proud spirit; next he craves acomplete cessation of all perturbing fascinating feelings a wakingsleep an enduring repose in the lap of a dull animal plant-likeindolence. next he seeks the battle and extinguishes it within himselfbecause weariness and boredom confront him. he binds hisself-deification with self-contempt. he delights in the wild tumult ofhis desires and the sharp pain of sin in the very idea of being lost.he is able to play his very passions for instance the desire todomineer a trick so that he goes to the other extreme of abjecthumiliation and subjection so that his overwrought soul is without anyrestraint through this antithesis. and finally when indulgence invisions in talks with the dead or with divine beings overcomes himthis is really but a form of gratification that he craves perhaps aform of gratification in which all other gratifications are blended.novalis one of the authorities in matters of sanctity because of hisexperience and instinct betrays the whole secret with the utmostsimplicity when he says: it is remarkable that the close connection ofgratification religion and cruelty has not long ago made men aware oftheir inner relationship and common tendency.=not what the saint is but what he was in= the eyes of thenon-sanctified gives him his historical importance. because thereexisted a delusion respecting the saint his soul states being falselyviewed and his personality being sundered as much as possible fromhumanity as a something incomparable and supernatural because of thesethings he attained the extraordinary with which he swayed theimaginations of whole nations and whole ages. even he knew himself notfor even he regarded his dispositions passions and actions inaccordance with a system of interpretation as artificial and exaggeratedas the pneumatic interpretation of the bible. the distorted and diseasedin his own nature with its blending of spiritual poverty defectiveknowledge ruined health overwrought nerves remained as hidden fromhis view as from the view of his beholders. he was neither aparticularly good man nor a particularly bad man but he stood forsomething that was far above the human standard in wisdom and goodness.faith in him sustained faith in the divine and miraculous in areligious significance of all existence in an impending day ofjudgment. in the last rays of the setting sun of the ancient worldwhich fell upon the christian peoples the shadowy form of the saintattained enormous proportions--to such enormous proportions indeedthat down even to our own age which no longer believes in god thereare thinkers who believe in the saints.it stands to reason that this sketch of the saint made upon the modelof the whole species can be confronted with many opposing sketches thatwould create a more agreeable impression. there are certain exceptionsamong the species who distinguish themselves either by especialgentleness or especial humanity and perhaps by the strength of theirown personality. others are in the highest degree fascinating becausecertain of their delusions shed a particular glow over their wholebeing as is the case with the founder of christianity who took himselffor the only begotten son of god and hence felt himself sinless; so thatthrough his imagination--that should not be too harshly judged since thewhole of antiquity swarmed with sons of god--he attained the same goalthe sense of complete sinlessness complete irresponsibility that cannow be attained by every individual through science.--in the same manneri have viewed the saints of india who occupy an intermediate stationbetween the christian saints and the greek philosophers and hence arenot to be regarded as a pure type. knowledge and science--as far as theyexisted--and superiority to the rest of mankind by logical disciplineand training of the intellectual powers were insisted upon by thebuddhists as essential to sanctity just as they were denounced by thechristian world as the indications of sinfulness.
