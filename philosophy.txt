12 INTRODUCTION

P

hilosophy is not just the
preserve of brilliant but
eccentric thinkers that it is
popularly supposed to be. It is what
everyone does when they’re not
busy dealing with their everyday
business and get a chance simply
to wonder what life and the
universe are all about. We human
beings are naturally inquisitive
creatures, and can’t help wondering
about the world around us and our
place in it. We’re also equipped with
a powerful intellectual capability,
which allows us to reason as well
as just wonder. Although we may
not realize it, whenever we reason,
we’re thinking philosophically.
Philosophy is not so much about
coming up with the answers to
fundamental questions as it is
about the process of trying to ﬁnd
these answers, using reasoning
rather than accepting without
question conventional views or
traditional authority. The very ﬁrst
philosophers, in ancient Greece and
China, were thinkers who were not
satisﬁed with the established
explanations provided by religion
and custom, and sought answers
which had rational justiﬁcations.
And, just as we might share our
views with friends and colleagues,
they discussed their ideas with
one another, and even set up

“schools” to teach not just the
conclusions they had come to, but
the way they had come to them.
They encouraged their students to
disagree and criticize ideas as a
means of reﬁning them and coming
up with new and different ones. A
popular misconception is that of
the solitary philosopher arriving at
his conclusions in isolation, but this
is actually seldom the case. New
ideas emerge through discussion
and the examination, analysis, and
criticism of other people’s ideas.

Debate and dialogue
The archetypical philosopher in
this respect was Socrates. He
didn’t leave any writings, or even

Wonder is very much the
affection of a philosopher;
for there is no other
beginning of philosophy
than this.
Plato

any big ideas as the conclusions of
his thinking. Indeed, he prided
himself on being the wisest of men
because he knew he didn’t know
anything. His legacy lay in the
tradition he established of debate
and discussion, of questioning the
assumptions of other people to gain
deeper understanding and elicit
fundamental truths. The writings
of Socrates’ pupil, Plato, are almost
invariably in the form of dialogues,
with Socrates as a major character.
Many later philosophers also
adopted the device of dialogues
to present their ideas, giving
arguments and counterarguments
rather than a simple statement of
their reasoning and conclusions.
The philosopher who presents
his ideas to the world is liable to
be met with comments beginning
“Yes, but ...” or “What if ...” rather
than wholehearted acceptance.
In fact, philosophers have ﬁercely
disagreed with one another about
almost every aspect of philosophy.
Plato and his pupil Aristotle, for
example, held diametrically
opposed views on fundamental
philosophical questions, and their
different approaches have divided
opinions among philosophers ever
since. This has, in turn, provoked
more discussion and prompted yet
more fresh ideas.

INTRODUCTION 13

But how can it be that these
philosophical questions are still
being discussed and debated?
Why haven’t thinkers come up
with deﬁnitive answers? What are
these “fundamental questions” that
philosophers through the ages have
wrestled with?

Existence and knowledge
When the ﬁrst true philosophers
appeared in ancient Greece some
2,500 years ago, it was the world
around them that inspired their
sense of wonder. They saw the
Earth and all the different forms of
life inhabiting it; the sun, moon,
planets, and stars; and natural
phenomena such as the weather,
earthquakes, and eclipses. They
sought explanations for all these
things—not the traditional myths
and legends about the gods, but
something that would satisfy their
curiosity and their intellect. The
ﬁrst question that occupied these
early philosophers was “What is the
universe made of?”, which was soon
expanded to become the wider
question of “What is the nature
of whatever it is that exists?”
This is the branch of philosophy
we now call metaphysics. Although
much of the original question has
since been explained by modern
science, related questions of

metaphysics such as “Why is there
something rather than nothing?”
are not so simply answered.
Because we, too, exist as a part
of the universe, metaphysics also
considers the nature of human
existence and what it means to be
a conscious being. How do we
perceive the world around us, and
do things exist independently of
our perception? What is the
relationship between our mind and
body, and is there such a thing as
an immortal soul? The area of
metaphysics concerned with
questions of existence, ontology, is
a huge one and forms the basis for
much of Western philosophy.
Once philosophers had started
to put received wisdom to the test
of rational examination, another
fundamental question became
obvious: “How can we know?” The
study of the nature and limits of
knowledge forms a second main
branch of philosophy, epistemology.
At its heart is the question of
how we acquire knowledge, how
we come to know what we know;
is some (or even all) knowledge
innate, or do we learn everything
from experience? Can we know
something from reasoning alone?
These questions are vital to
philosophical thinking, as we need
to be able to rely on our knowledge

in order to reason correctly. We also
need to determine the scope and
limits of our knowledge. Otherwise
we cannot be sure that we actually
do know what we think we know,
and haven’t somehow been “tricked”
into believing it by our senses.

Logic and language
Reasoning relies on establishing
the truth of statements, which can
then be used to build up a train of
thought leading to a conclusion. This
might seem obvious to us now, but
the idea of constructing a rational
argument distinguished philosophy
from the superstitious and religious
explanations that had existed before
the first philosophers. These
thinkers had to devise a way of
ensuring their ideas had validity. ❯❯

Superstition sets the
whole world in ﬂames;
philosophy quenches them.
Voltaire

14 INTRODUCTION

What emerged from their thinking
was logic, a technique of reasoning
that was gradually reﬁned over time.
At ﬁrst simply a useful tool for
analyzing whether an argument
held water, logic developed rules
and conventions, and soon became
a ﬁeld of study in its own right,
another branch of the expanding
subject of philosophy.
Like so much of philosophy,
logic has intimate connections
with science, and mathematics in
particular. The basic structure of
a logical argument, starting from
a premise and working through
a series of steps to a conclusion, is
the same as that of a mathematical
proof. It’s not surprising then that
philosophers have often turned to
mathematics for examples of selfevident, incontrovertible truths, nor
that many of the greatest thinkers,
from Pythagoras to René Descartes
and Gottfried Leibniz, were also
accomplished mathematicians.
Although logic might seem to
be the most exact and “scientiﬁc”
branch of philosophy, a ﬁeld where
things are either right or wrong,
a closer look at the subject shows
that it is not so simple. Advances
in mathematics in the 19th century
called into question the rules of
logic that had been laid down by
Aristotle, but even in ancient times

Zeno of Elea’s famous paradoxes
reached absurd conclusions from
apparently faultless arguments.
A large part of the problem is
that philosophical logic, unlike
mathematics, is expressed in words
rather than numbers or symbols,
and is subject to all the ambiguities
and subtleties inherent in language.
Constructing a reasoned argument
involves using language carefully
and accurately, examining our
statements and arguments to make
sure they mean what we think they
mean; and when we study other
people’s arguments, we have to
analyze not only the logical steps
they take, but also the language
they use, to see if their conclusions
hold water. Out of this process came
yet another ﬁeld of philosophy that
ﬂourished in the 20th century, the
philosophy of language, which
examined terms and their meanings.

Morality, art, and politics
Because our language is imprecise,
philosophers have attempted to
clarify meanings in their search for
answers to philosophical questions.
The sort of questions that Socrates
asked the citizens of Athens tried
to get to the bottom of what they
actually believed certain concepts
to be. He would ask seemingly
simple questions such as “What is

justice?” or “What is beauty?” not
only to elicit meanings, but also to
explore the concepts themselves.
In discussions of this sort, Socrates
challenged assumptions about the
way we live our lives and the things
we consider to be important.
The examination of what it
means to lead a “good” life, what
concepts such as justice and
happiness actually mean and how
we can achieve them, and how we
should behave, forms the basis for
the branch of philosophy known as
ethics (or moral philosophy); and the
related branch stemming from the
question of what constitutes beauty
and art is known as aesthetics.

O philosophy, life’s guide!
O searcher-out of virtue
and expeller of vices!
What could we and every
age of men have been
without thee?
Cicero

INTRODUCTION 15

From considering ethical questions
about our individual lives, it is a
natural step to start thinking about
the sort of society we would like to
live in—how it should be governed,
the rights and responsibilities of
its citizens, and so on. Political
philosophy, the last of the major
branches of philosophy, deals with
these ideas, and philosophers have
come up with models of how they
believe society should be organized,
ranging from Plato’s Republic to
Karl Marx’s Communist Manifesto.

Religion: East and West
The various branches of philosophy
are not only interlinked, but overlap
considerably, and it is sometimes
difﬁcult to say in which area a
particular idea falls. Philosophy also
encroaches on many completely
different subjects, including the
sciences, history, and the arts. With
its beginnings in questioning the
dogmas of religion and superstition,
philosophy also examines religion
itself, speciﬁcally asking questions
such as “Does god exist?” and “Do
we have an immortal soul?” These
are questions that have their roots
in metaphysics, but they have
implications in ethics too. For
example, some philosophers have
asked whether our morality comes
from god or whether it is a purely

human construct—and this in turn
has raised the whole debate as to
what extent humanity has free will.
In the Eastern philosophies
that evolved in China and India
(particularly Daoism and Buddhism)
the lines between philosophy and
religion are less clear, at least to
Western ways of thinking. This
marks one of the major differences
between Western and Eastern
philosophies. Although Eastern
philosophies are not generally a
result of divine revelation or
religious dogma, they are often
intricately linked with what we
would consider matters of faith.
Even though philosophical
reasoning is frequently used to
justify faith in the Judeo-Christian
and Islamic world, faith and belief

There is nothing either
good or bad, but thinking
makes it so.
William Shakespeare

form an integral part of Eastern
philosophy that has no parallel in
the West. Eastern and Western
philosophy also differ in their
starting points. Where the ancient
Greeks posed metaphysical
questions, the ﬁrst Chinese
philosophers considered these
adequately dealt with by religion,
and instead concerned themselves
with moral and political philosophy.

Following the reasoning
Philosophy has provided us with
some of the most important and
inﬂuential ideas in history. What
this book presents is a collection
of ideas from the best-known
philosophers, encapsulated in well
known quotes and pithy summaries
of their ideas. Perhaps the bestknown quotation in philosophy is
Descartes’ “cogito, ergo sum” (often
translated from the Latin as “I think,
therefore I am”). It ranks as one of
the most important ideas in the
history of philosophy, and is widely
considered a turning point in
thinking, leading us into the modern
era. On its own however, the
quotation doesn’t mean much. It is
the conclusion of a line of argument
about the nature of certainty, and
only when we examine the
reasoning leading to it does the
idea begin to make sense. And ❯❯

16 INTRODUCTION

it’s only when we see where
Descartes took the idea—what the
consequences of that conclusion
are—that we see its importance.
Many of the ideas in this book
may seem puzzling at ﬁrst glance.
Some may appear self-evident,
others paradoxical or ﬂying in the
face of common sense. They might
even appear to prove Bertrand
Russell’s ﬂippant remark that “the
point of philosophy is to start with
something so simple as not to seem
worth stating, and to end with
something so paradoxical that no
one will believe it.” So why are
these ideas important?

Systems of thought
Sometimes the theories presented
in this book were the ﬁrst of their
kind to appear in the history of
thought. While their conclusions
may seem obvious to us now, in
hindsight, they were startlingly
new in their time, and despite their
apparent simplicity, they may make
us reexamine things that we take
for granted. The theories presented
here that seem to be paradoxes and
counter-intuitive statements are the
ideas that really call into question
our assumptions about ourselves
and the world—and they also make
us think in new ways about how
we see things. There are many

ideas here that raise issues that
philosophers still puzzle over.
Some ideas may relate to other
thoughts and theories in different
ﬁelds of the same philosopher’s
thinking, or have come from an
analysis or criticism of another
philosopher’s work. These latter
ideas form part of a line of
reasoning that may extend over
several generations or even
centuries, or be the central idea of
a particular “school” of philosophy.
Many of the great philosophers
formed integrated “systems” of
philosophy with interconnecting
ideas. For example, their opinions
about how we acquire knowledge
led to a particular metaphysical
view of the universe and man’s
soul. This in turn has implications
for what kind of life the philosopher
believes we should lead and what
type of society would be ideal. And
in turn, this entire system of ideas
has been the starting point for
subsequent philosophers.
We must remember too that
these ideas never quite become
outdated. They still have much to
tell us, even when their conclusions
have been proved wrong by
subsequent philosophers and
scientists. In fact, many ideas that
had been dismissed for centuries
were later to be proved startlingly

prescient—the theories of the
ancient Greek atomists for example.
More importantly, these thinkers
established the processes of
philosophy, ways of thinking and
organizing our thoughts. We must
remember that these ideas are only
a small part of a philosopher’s
thinking—usually the conclusion
to a longer line of reasoning.

Science and society
These ideas spread their inﬂuence
beyond philosophy too. Some have
spawned mainstream scientiﬁc,
political, or artistic movements.
Often the relationship between
science and philosophy is a backand-forth affair, with ideas from one
informing the other. Indeed, there
is a whole branch of philosophy
that studies the thinking behind

Scepticism is the ﬁrst
step towards truth.
Denis Diderot

INTRODUCTION 17

scientiﬁc methods and practices.
The development of logical thinking
affected how math evolved and
became the basis for the scientiﬁc
method, which relies on systematic
observation to explain the world.
Ideas about the nature of the self
and consciousness have developed
into the science of psychology.
The same is true of philosophy’s
relationship with society. Ethics of
all sorts found adherents in political
leaders throughout history, shaping
the societies we live in today, and
even prompting revolutions. The
ethical decisions made in all kinds
of professions have moral dimensions
that are informed by the ideas of
the great thinkers of philosophy.

Behind the ideas
The ideas in this book have come
from people living in societies and
cultures which have shaped those
ideas. As we examine the ideas, we
get a picture of certain national and
regional characteristics, as well as
a ﬂavor of the times they lived in.
The philosophers presented here
emerge as distinct personalities—
some thinkers are optimistic, others
pessimistic; some are meticulous
and painstaking, others think in
broad sweeps; some express
themselves in clear, precise
language, others in a poetic way,

and still more in dense, abstract
language that takes time to unpick.
If you read these ideas in the
original texts, you will not only
agree or disagree with the what
they say, and follow the reasoning
by which they reached their
conclusions, but also get a feeling
of what kind of person is behind it.
You might, for example, warm to
the witty and charming Hume,
appreciating his beautifully clear
prose, while not altogether feeling
at home with what he has to say; or
ﬁnd Schopenhauer both persuasive
and a delight to read, while getting
the distinct feeling that he was not
a particularly likeable man.
Above all these thinkers were
(and still are) interesting and
stimulating. The best were also
great writers too, and reading
their original writings can be as
rewarding as reading literature; we
can appreciate not just their literary
style, but also their philosophical
style, the way they present their
arguments. As well as being
thought-provoking, it can be as
uplifting as great art, as elegant as
a mathematical proof, and as witty
as an after-dinner speaker.
Philosophy is not simply about
ideas—it’s a way of thinking. There
are frequently no right or wrong
answers, and different philosophers

often come to radically different
conclusions in their investigations
into questions that science cannot
—and religion does not—explain.

Enjoying philosophy
If wonder and curiosity are human
attributes, so too are the thrill of
exploration and the joy of discovery.
We can gain the same sort of
“buzz” from philosophy that we
might get from physical activity,
and the same pleasure that we
enjoy from an appreciating the arts.
Above all, we gain the satisfaction
of arriving at beliefs and ideas that
are not handed down or forced upon
us by society, teachers, religion, or
even philosophers, but through our
own individual reasoning. ■

The beginning of thought
is in disagreement—not
only with others but also
with ourselves.

rom the beginning of human
history, people have asked
questions about the world
and their place within it. For early
societies, the answers to the most
fundamental questions were found
in religion: the actions of the gods
explained the workings of the
universe, and provided a framework
for human civilizations.
Some people, however, found the
traditional religious explanations
inadequate, and they began to
search for answers based on reason
rather than convention or religion.
This shift marked the birth of
philosophy, and the ﬁrst of the great
thinkers that we know of was Thales
of Miletus—Miletus was a Greek
settlement in modern-day Turkey.
Thales used reason to inquire into
the nature of the universe, and
encouraged others to do likewise.

He passed on to his followers not
only his answers, but the process
of thinking rationally, together with
an idea of what kind of explanations
could be considered satisfactory.
For this reason Thales is generally
regarded as the ﬁrst philosopher.
The main concern of the early
philosophers centered around
Thales’ basic question: “What is
the world made of?” Their answers
form the foundations of scientiﬁc
thought, and forged a relationship
between science and philosophy
that still exists today. The work of
Pythagoras marked a key turning
point, as he sought to explain the
world not in terms of primal matter,
but in terms of mathematics. He and
his followers described the
structure of the cosmos in numbers
and geometry. Although some of
these mathematical relationships

acquired mystical signiﬁcance for
Pythagoras and his followers, their
numerical explanation of the cosmos
had a profound inﬂuence on the
beginnings of scientiﬁc thought.

Classical Greek philosophy
As the Greek city-states grew in
stature, philosophy spread across
the Greek world from Ionia, and in
particular to Athens, which was
rapidly becoming the cultural
center of Greece. It was here that
philosophers broadened the scope of
philosophy to include new questions,
such as “How do we know what we
know?” and “How should we live
our lives?” It was an Athenian,
Socrates, who ushered in the short
but hugely inﬂuential period of
Classical Greek philosophy. Although
he left no writings, his ideas were so
important that they steered the

future course of philosophy, and
all philosophers before him became
known as the pre-socratics. His pupil
Plato founded a philosophical school
in Athens called the Academy (from
which the word “academic” derives)
where he taught and developed his
master’s ideas, passing them on to
students such as Aristotle, who was
a pupil and teacher there for 20 years.
The contrasting ideas and methods
of these great thinkers—Socrates,
Plato, and Aristotle—form the basis
of Western philosophy as we know
it today, and their differences of
opinion have continued to divide
philosophers throughout history.
The Classical period of ancient
Greece effectively came to an end
with the death of Alexander the
Great in 323 BCE. This great leader
had uniﬁed Greece, and Greek citystates that had worked together

once again became rivals. Following
the death of Aristotle in 322 BCE,
philosophy also divided into very
different schools of thought, as the
cynics, sceptics, epicureans, and
stoics argued their positions.
Over the next couple of centuries,
Greek culture waned as the Roman
Empire grew. The Romans had
little time for Greek philosophy
apart from stoicism, but Greek
ideas persisted, mainly because
they were preserved in the
manuscripts and translations of
the Arab world. They resurfaced
later, during medieval times, with
the rise of Christianity and Islam.

Eastern philosophies
Thinkers throughout Asia were also
questioning conventional wisdom.
Political upheaval in China from
771 to 481 BCE led to a collection of

philosophies that were less
concerned with the nature of
the universe than with how best
to organize a just society and
provide moral guidelines for the
individuals within it; in the process
examining what constitutes a
“good” life. The so-called “Hundred
Schools of Thought” ﬂourished in
this period, and the most signiﬁcant
of these were Confucianism and
Daoism, both of which continued
to dominate Chinese philosophy
until the 20th century.
To the south of China an equally
inﬂuential philosopher appeared:
Siddhartha Gautama, later known
as the Buddha. From his teaching
in northern India around 500 BCE,
his philosophy spread across the
subcontinent and over most of
southern Asia, where it is still
widely practiced. ■

AFTER
Early 5th century BCE
Empedocles proposes the four
basic elements of the cosmos:
earth, water, air, and ﬁre.
c.400 BCE Leucippus and
Democritus conclude that the
cosmos is made up solely of
atoms and empty space.

From observation, Thales deduced that speciﬁc
weather conditions, not appeals to the gods, led to a good
harvest. Predicting a high yield of olives one year, he is
said to have bought up all the local olive presses, then
proﬁted by renting them out to meet increased demand.

D

uring the Archaic period
(mid-8th–6th century BCE),
the peoples of the Greek
peninsula gradually settled into a
group of city-states. They developed
an alphabetical system of writing,
as well as the beginnings of what
is now recognized as Western
philosophy. Previous civilizations
had relied on religion to explain
phenomena in the world around
them; now a new breed of thinkers
emerged, who attempted to ﬁnd
natural, rational explanations.
The ﬁrst of these new scientiﬁc
thinkers that we are aware of was
Thales of Miletus. Nothing survives
of his writings, but we know that
he had a good grasp of geometry
and astronomy, and is reputed to

have predicted the total eclipse of
the sun in 585 BCE. This practical
turn of mind led him to believe that
events in the world were not due to
supernatural intervention, but had
natural causes that reason and
observation would reveal.

Fundamental substance
Thales needed to establish a ﬁrst
principle from which to work, so
he posed the question, “What is
the basic material of the cosmos?”
The idea that everything in the
universe can be ultimately reduced
to a single substance is the theory
of monism, and Thales and his
followers were the ﬁrst to propose
it within Western philosophy.
Thales reasons that the fundamental

What is the basic
material of the cosmos?

It must be…

material of the universe had to be
something out of which everything
else could be formed, as well as
being essential to life, and capable
of motion and therefore of change.
He observes that water is clearly
necessary to sustain all forms of
life, and that it moves and changes,
assuming different forms – from
liquid to solid ice and vaporous
mist. So Thales concludes that all
matter, regardless of its apparent
properties, must be water in some
stage of transformation.
Thales also notes that every
landmass appears to come to an
end at the water’s edge. From this
he deduces that the whole of the
earth must be ﬂoating on a bed of
water, from which it has emerged.

When anything occurs to cause
ripples or tremors in this water,
Thales states, we experience
them as earthquakes.
However, as interesting as
the details of Thales’ theories are,
they are not the main reason why
he is considered a major ﬁgure in
the history of philosophy. His true
importance lies in the fact that he
was the ﬁrst known thinker to seek
naturalistic, rational answers to
fundamental questions, rather than
to ascribe objects and events to the
whims of capricious gods. By doing
so, he and the later philosophers
of the Milesian School laid the
foundations for future scientiﬁc
and philosophical thought across
the Western world. ■

Although we know that
Thales was born and lived in
Miletus, on the coast of what
is now Turkey, we know very
little about his life. None of his
writings, if indeed he left any,
have survived. However, his
reputation as one of the key
early Greek thinkers seems
deserved, and he is referred
to in some detail by both
Aristotle and Diogenes
Laertius, the 3rd-century
biographer of the ancient
Greek philosophers.
Anecdotal evidence
suggests that as well as
being a philosopher, Thales
was actively involved in
politics and was a very
successful businessman. He
is thought to have traveled
widely around the eastern
Mediterranean, and while
visiting Egypt, to have learned
the practical geometry that
was to become the basis of his
deductive reasoning.
However, Thales was
above all a teacher, the ﬁrst of
the so-called Milesian School
of philosophers. Anaximander,
his pupil, expanded his
scientiﬁc theories, and in
turn became a mentor to
Anaximenes, who is believed
to have taught the young
mathematician Pythagoras.

Chinese philosophy evolved from
practical politics and was therefore
concerned with morality and ethics
rather than the nature of the cosmos.
One of the most important ideas
to appear at this time came from
the Daode jing (The Way and its
Power), which has been attributed
to Laozi (Lao Tzu). It was one of the
ﬁrst attempts to propose a theory
of just rule, based on de (virtue),

which could be found by following
dao (the Way), and forms the basis
of the philosophy known as Daoism.

Cycles of change
In order to understand the concept
of dao, it is necessary to know how
the ancient Chinese viewed the
ever-changing world. For them, the
changes are cyclical, continually
moving from one state to another,
such as from night to day, summer
to winter, and so on. They saw the
different states not as opposites,
but as related, one arising from the
other. These states also possess
complementary properties that
together make up a whole. The
process of change is seen as an
expression of dao, and leads to the
10,000 manifestations that make up
the world. Laozi, in the Daode jing,
says that humans are merely one
of these 10,000 manifestations and
have no special status. But because
of our desire and free will, we can
stray from the dao, and disturb the
world’s harmonious balance. To live
a virtuous life means acting in
accordance with the dao.
So little is known for certain about
the author of the Daode jing, who
is traditionally assumed to be
Laozi (Lao Tzu). He has become
an almost mythical ﬁgure; it has
even been suggested that the
book was not by Laozi, but is in
fact a compilation of sayings by a
number of scholars. What we do
know is that there was a scholar
born in the state of Chu, with the
name Li Er or Lao Tan, during
the Zhou dynasty, who became
known as Laozi (the Old Master).
Several texts indicate that he was
an archivist at the Zhou court, and
that Confucius consulted him on

Knowing others
is intelligence; knowing
yourself is true wisdom.
Laozi

Following the dao, however, is not
a simple matter, as the Daode jing
acknowledges. Philosophizing
about dao is pointless, as it is
beyond anything that humans can
conceive of. It is characterized by
wu (“not-being”), so we can only
live according to the dao by wu
wei, literally “non-action.” By this
Laozi does not mean “not doing”,
but acting in accordance with
nature—spontaneously and
intuitively. That in turn entails
acting without desire, ambition,
or recourse to social conventions. ■
rituals and ceremonies. Legend
states that Laozi left the court
as the Zhou dynasty declined,
and journeyed west in search
of solitude. As he was about to
cross the border, one of the
guards recognized him and
asked for a record of his wisdom.
Laozi wrote the Daode jing for
him, and then continued on his
way, never to be seen again.

Croton, southern Italy. His disciples

The Pythagoreans, as his disciples

and the scientiﬁc—seem to be

Little is known about Pythagoras’s
life. He left no writings himself,
and unfortunately, as the Greek
philosopher Porphyry noted in his
Vita Pythagorae, “No one knows
for certain what Pythagoras told
his associates, since they observed
an unusual silence.” However,
modern scholars believe that
Pythagoras was probably born on
the island of Samos, off the coast
of modern-day Turkey. As a young
man, he travelled widely, perhaps
studying at the Milesian School,
and probably visiting Egypt, which
was a centrer of learning. At
the age of about 40, he set up a

community of around 300 people
in Croton, southern Italy. Its
members studied a mixture of
mystical and academic studies,
and despite its collective nature,
Pythagoras was clearly the
community’s leader. At the age
of 60, he is said to have married
a young girl, Theano of Crotona.
Growing hostility toward the
Pythagorean cult eventually
forced him to leave Croton, and
he ﬂed to Metapontum, also in
southern Italy, where he died
soon after. His community had
virtually disappeared by the end
of the 4th century BCE.

28 PYTHAGORAS
Pythagoras’s Theorem showed that shapes
and ratios are governed by principles that
can be discovered. This suggested that it
might be possible, in time, to work out the
structure of the entire cosmos.

as self-evident, as if god-given, and
worked out mathematical proofs that
had the impact of divine revelation.
Because these mathematical
discoveries were a product of pure
reasoning, Pythagoras believes
they are more valuable than mere
observations. For example, the
Egyptians had discovered that a
triangle whose sides have ratios of
3:4:5 always has a right angle, and
this was useful in practice, such as
in architecture. But Pythagoras
uncovered the underlying principle
behind all right-angled triangles
(that the square of the hypotenuse
equals the sum of the squares of the
other two sides) and found it to be
universally true. This discovery was
so extraordinary, and held such
potential, that the Pythagoreans
took it to be divine revelation.
Pythagoras concludes that the
whole cosmos must be governed
by mathematical rules. He says

=

c2

that number (numerical ratios and
mathematical axioms) can be used
to explain the very structure of the
cosmos. He does not totally dismiss
the Milesian idea that the universe
is made up of one fundamental
substance, but he shifts the enquiry
from substance to form.
This was such a profound change
in the way of looking at the world,
that we should probably forgive
Pythagoras and his disciples for
getting somewhat carried away,
and giving numbers a mystical
signiﬁcance. Through exploring the
relationship between numbers and
geometry, they discoved the square
numbers and cube numbers that
we speak of today, but they also
attributed characteristics to them,
such as “good” to the even numbers
and “evil” to the odd ones, and even
speciﬁcs such as “justice” to the
number four, and so on. The number
ten, in the form of the tetractys (a

triangular shape made up of rows of
dots) had a particular signiﬁcance
in Pythagorean ritual. Less
contentiously, they saw the number
one as a single point, a unity, from
which other things could be derived.
The number two, in this way of
thinking, was a line, number three a
surface or plane, and four a solid; the
correspondence with our modern
concept of dimensions is obvious.
The Pythagorean explanation of
the creation of the universe followed
a mathematical pattern: on the
Unlimited (the inﬁnite that existed
before the universe), God imposed a
Limit, so that all that exists came to
have an actual size. In this way God
created a measurable unity from
which everything else was formed.

Numerical harmonies
Pythagoras’s most important
discovery was the relationships
between numbers: the ratios and
proportions. This was reinforced by
his investigations into music, and
in particular into the relationships
between notes that sounded pleasant
together. The story goes that he
ﬁrst stumbled onto this idea when
listening to blacksmiths at work. One
had an anvil half the size of the other,
and the sounds they made when

THE ANCIENT WORLD 29
hit with a hammer were exactly an
octave (eight notes) apart. While
this may be true, it was probably by
experimenting with a plucked string
that Pythagoras determined the
ratios of the consonant intervals
(the number of notes between two
notes that determines whether they
will sound harmonious if struck
together). What he discovered was
that these intervals were harmonious
because the relationship between
them was a precise and simple
mathematical ratio. This series,
which we now know as the harmonic
series, conﬁrmed for him that the
elegance of the mathematics he had
found in abstract geometry also
existed in the natural world.

The stars and elements
Pythagoras had now proved not
only that the structure of the
universe can be explained in
mathemathical terms—“number
is the ruler of forms”—but also
that acoustics is an exact science,
and number governs harmonious
proportions. He then started to
apply his theories to the whole
cosmos, demonstrating the
harmonic relationship of the stars,
planets, and elements. His idea
of harmonic relationships between
the stars was eagerly taken up
by medieval and Renaissance
astronomers, who developed whole
theories around the idea of the music
of the spheres, and his suggestion
that the elements were arranged
harmoniously was revisited over
2,000 years after his death. In 1865
English chemist John Newlands
discovered that when the chemical
elements are arranged according to

Pythagorean mathematical ratios.
Harmonious shapes and ratios are used
throughout, scaled down in the smaller
parts, and up for the overall structure.

atomic weight, those with similar
properties occur at every eighth
element, like notes of music. This
discovery became known as the
Law of Octaves, and it helped lead
to the development of the Periodic
Law of chemical elements still
used today.
Pythagoras also established the
principle of deductive reasoning,
which is the step-by-step process
of starting with self-evident axioms
(such as “2 + 2 = 4”) to build toward
a new conclusion or fact. Deductive
reasoning was later reﬁned by
Euclid, and it formed the basis
of mathematical thinking into
medieval times and beyond.
One of Pythagoras’s most
important contributions to the
development of philosophy was
the idea that abstract thinking
is superior to the evidence of the
senses. This was taken up by
Plato in his theory of Forms, and
resurfaced in the philosophical
method of the rationalists in the
17th century. The Pythagorean
attempt to combine the rational
with the religious was the ﬁrst

that has dogged philosophy and
religion in some ways ever since.
Almost everything we know
about Pythagoras comes to us from
others; even the bare facts of his life
are largely conjecture. Yet he has
achieved a near-legendary status
(which he apparently encouraged) for
the ideas attributed to him. Whether
or not he was in fact the originator
of these ideas does not really matter;
what is important is their profound

on the sacred Veda texts—was

and Siddhartha Gautama was the

philosophical reasoning.

Gautama, although revered by
Buddhists for his wisdom, was
neither a messiah nor a prophet,
and he did not act as a medium
between God and Man. His ideas
were arrived at through reasoning,
not divine revelation, and it is this
that marks Buddhism out as a
philosophy as much as (perhaps
even more than) a religion. His
quest was philosophical—to
discover truths—and he
maintained that these truths are
available to all of us through the
power of reason. Like most Eastern
philosophers, he was not interested
in the unanswerable questions of
metaphysics that preoccupied the
Greeks. Dealing with entities

beyond our experience, this kind of
enquiry was senseless speculation.
Instead, he concerned himself with
the question of the goal of life,
which in turn involved examining
the concepts of happiness, virtue,
and the “good” life.

The middle way
In his early life, Gautama enjoyed
luxury and, we are told, all the
sensual pleasures. However, he
realized that these were not enough
on their own to bring him true
happiness. He was acutely aware
of the suffering in the world, and
saw that it was largely due to
sickness, old age, and death, and
the fact that people lack what ❯❯

Siddhartha Gautama
Almost all we know of
Siddhartha Gautama’s life
comes from biographies
written by his followers
centuries after his death, and
which differ widely in many
details. What is certain is
that he was born in Lumbini,
modern-day Nepal, some time
around 560 BCE. His father
was an ofﬁcial, possibly
the leader of a clan, and
Siddhartha led a privileged
life of luxury and high status.
Dissatisﬁed with this,
Siddhartha left his wife and
son to ﬁnd a spiritual path,
and discovered the “middle
way” between sensual
indulgence and asceticism.
He experienced enlightenment
while thinking in the shade of
a bodhi tree, and devoted the
rest of his life to traveling
throughout India, preaching.
After his death, his teachings
were passed down orally for
some 400 years before being
written down in the Tipitaka
(Three Baskets).

may bring short-term gratiﬁcation,
but not happiness in the sense of
contentment and peace of mind.

The “not-self”

The Buddha cut off his hair as part of
his renunciation of the material world.
According to Buddhist teaching, the
temptations of the world are the source
of all suffering, and must be resisted.

they need. He also recognized that
the sensual pleasure we indulge
in to relieve suffering is rarely
satisfying, and that when it is, the
effects are transitory. He found the
experience of extreme asceticism
(austerity and abstinence) equally
dissatisfying, bringing him no
nearer to an understanding of how
to achieve happiness.
Gautama came to the conclusion
that there must be a “middle way”
between self-indulgence and selfmortiﬁcation. This middle way,
he believed, should lead to true
happiness, or “enlightenment”,
and to ﬁnd it he applied reason
to his own experiences.
Suffering, he realized, is
universal. It is an integral part of
existence, and the root cause of our
suffering is the frustration of our
desires and expectations. These
desires he calls “attachments”, and
they include not only our sensual
desires and worldly ambitions,
but our most basic instinct for
self-preservation. Satisfying
these attachments, he argues,

The next step in Gautama’s
reasoning is that the elimination
of attachments will prevent any
disappointment, and so avoid
suffering. To achieve this, he
suggests a root cause of our
attachments—our selﬁshness,
and by selﬁshness he means more
than just our tendency to seek
gratiﬁcation. For Gautama,
selﬁshness is self-centeredness
and self-attachment—the domain
of what today we would call the
“ego.” So, to free ourselves from
attachments that cause us pain,
it is not enough merely to renounce
the things we desire—we must
overcome our attachment to that
which desires—the “self.”
But how can this be done?
Desire, ambition, and expectation
are part of our nature, and for
most of us constitute our very
reasons for living. The answer,
for Gautama, is that the ego’s
world is illusory—as he shows,
again, by a process of reasoning.
He argues that nothing in the
universe is self-caused, for
everything is the result of some
previous action, and each of us is
only a transitory part of this eternal
process—ultimately impermanent
and without substance. So, in
reality, there is no “self” that is not
part of the greater whole—or the
“not-self”—and suffering results
from our failure to recognize this.
This does not mean that we should
deny our existence or personal
identity, rather that we should
understand them for what they
are—transient and insubstantial.
Grasping the concept of being a
constituent part of an eternal “notself”, rather than clinging to the

notion of being a unique “self”, is
the key to losing that attachment,
and ﬁnding a release from suffering.

The Eightfold Path
Gautama’s reasoning from the
causes of suffering to the way to
achieve happiness is codiﬁed in
Buddhist teachings in the Four
Noble Truths: that suffering is
universal; that desire is the cause
of suffering; that suffering can be
avoided by eliminating desire;
that following the Eightfold Path
will eliminate desire. This last
Truth refers to what amounts to
a practical guide to the “middle
way” that Gautama laid out for his
followers to achieve enlightenment.

Peace comes
from within. Do not
seek it without.
Siddhartha Gautama

THE ANCIENT WORLD 33
The Eightfold Path (right action,
right intention, right livelihood,
right effort, right concentration,
right speech, right understanding,
and right mindfulness) is in effect
a code of ethics—a prescription for
a good life and the happiness that
Gautama ﬁrst set out to ﬁnd.

Nirvana
Gautama sees the ultimate goal of
life on Earth to be the ending of the
cycle of suffering (birth, death, and
rebirth) into which we are born. By
following the Eightfold Path, a man
can overcome his ego and live a
life free from suffering, and through
his enlightenment he can avoid the
pain of rebirth into another life of
suffering. He has realized his place
in the “not-self”, and become at one
with the eternal. He has attained
the state of Nirvana—which is
variously translated as “nonattachment”, “not-being”, or literally
“blowing out” (as of a candle).
In the Brahmanism of Gautama’s
time, and the Hindu religion that
followed, Nirvana was seen as
becoming one with god, but
Gautama carefully avoids any
mention of a deity or of an ultimate
purpose to life. He merely describes
Nirvana as “unborn, unoriginated,
uncreated, and unformed”, and
transcending any sensory

experience. It is an eternal and
unchanging state of not-being,
and so the ultimate freedom from
the suffering of existence.
Gautama spent many years
after his enlightenment traveling
around India, preaching and
teaching. During his lifetime, he
gained a considerable following,
and Buddhism became established
as a major religion as well as a
philosophy. His teachings were
passed down orally from generation
to generation by his followers, until
the 1st century CE, when they were
written down for the ﬁrst time.
Various schools began to appear
as Buddhism spread across India,
and later spread eastward into
China and Southeast Asia, where
it rivalled Confucianism and
Daoism in its popularity.

Gautama’s teachings spread as far
as the Greek empire by the 3rd
century BCE, but had little inﬂuence
on Western philosophy. However,
there were similarities between
Gautama’s approach to philosophy
and that of the Greeks, not least
Gautama’s emphasis on reasoning
as a means of ﬁnding happiness, and
his disciples’ use of philosophical
dialogues to elucidate his teachings.
His thoughts also ﬁnd echoes in the
ideas of later Western philosophers,
such as in Hume’s concept of the
self and Schopenhauer’s view of
the human condition. But it was
not until the 20th century that
Buddhism was to have any direct
inﬂuence on Western thinking.
Since then, more and more
Westerners have turned to it
for guidance on how to live. ■

Confucius

F

rom 770 to 220 BCE, China
enjoyed an era of great
cultural development, and
the philosophies that emerged
at this time were known as the
Hundred Schools of Thought. By
the 6th century BCE, the Zhou
Dynasty was in decline—moving
from the stability of the Spring
and Autumn Period to the aptly
named Warring States Period—
and it was during this time that
Kong Fuzi, the Master Kong, or
Confucius, was born. Like other
philosophers of the age—such as
Thales, Pythagoras, and Heraclitus
of Greece—Confucius sought
constants in a world of change,
and for him this meant a search
for moral values that could enable
rulers to govern justly.

The Analects
Unlike many of the early Chinese
philosophers, Confucius looked
to the past for his inspiration. He
was conservative by nature, and
had a great respect for ritual and
ancestor worship—both of which
were maintained by the Zhou
Dynasty, whose rulers received
authority from the gods via the
so-called Heavenly Mandate.
According to tradition, Confucius
was born in 551 BCE in Qufu, in
the state of Lu, China. His name
was originally Kong Qiu, and only
later did he earn the title Kong
Fuzi, or “Master Kong.” Little is
known about his life, except that
he was from a well-to-do family,
and that as a young man he
worked as a servant to support
his family after his father died.
He nevertheless managed to ﬁnd
time to study, and became an
administrator in the Zhou court,
but when his suggestions to the
rulers were ignored he left to
concentrate on teaching.

The superior man does
what is proper to the station
in which he is; he does not
desire to go beyond this.
Confucius

A rigid social hierarchy existed in
China, but Confucius was part of
a new class of scholars who acted
as advisors to the courts—in effect
a class of civil servants—and they
achieved their status not through
inheritance, but by merit. It was
Confucius’s integration of the
old ideals with the emerging
meritocracy that produced his
unique new moral philosophy.
The main source we have for
the teachings of Confucius is the
Analects, a collection of fragments
of his writings and sayings compiled
by his disciples. It is primarily
a political treatise, made up of
As a teacher he traveled
throughout the empire, and at
the end of his life he returned
to Qufu, where he died in 479
BCE. His teaching survives in
fragments and sayings passed
down orally to his disciples,
and collected in the Analects
and anthologies compiled by
Confucian scholars.

aphorisms and anecdotes that form
a sort of rule book for good
government—but his use of the
word junzi (literally “gentleman”) to
denote a superior, virtuous man,
indicates that his concerns were as
much social as political. Indeed,
many passages of the Analects
read like a book of etiquette. But
to see the Analects as merely a
social or political treatise is to miss
its central point. At its heart lies a
comprehensive ethical system.

The virtuous life
Before the appearance of the
Hundred Schools of Thought,
the world had been explained by
mythology and religion, and power
and moral authority were generally
accepted to be god-given. Confucius
is pointedly silent about the gods,
but he often refers to tian, or

Heaven, as the source of moral
order. According to the Analects,
we humans are the agents that
Heaven has chosen to embody its
will and to unite the world with
the moral order—an idea that was
in line with traditional Chinese
thinking. What breaks with
tradition, however, is Confucius’s
belief that de—virtue—is not
something Heaven-sent for the
ruling classes, but something that
can be cultivated—and cultivated
by anyone. Having himself risen to
be a minister of the Zhou court,
he believed that it was a duty of
the middle classes, as well as the
rulers, to strive to act with virtue
and benevolence (ren) to achieve
a just and stable society.
To reconcile the fact that society
was a rigid class system with his
belief that all men can receive the

blessing of the Heavenly Mandate,
Confucius argues that the virtuous
man is not simply one who stands
at the top of the social hierarchy,
but one who understands his
place within that hierarchy and
embraces it to the full. And to
deﬁne the various means of acting
in accordance with de—virtue—he
turns to traditional Chinese values:
zhong, loyalty; xiao, ﬁlial piety; li,
ritual propriety; and shu, reciprocity.
The person who sincerely observes
these values Confucius called junzi,
the gentleman or superior man, by
which he means a man of virtue,
learning, and good manners.
The values of de had evolved
within the ruling classes but had
become little more than empty
gestures in the disintegrating
world of the Zhou Dynasty.

persuade the rulers to return to
these ideals and to restore a just
government, but he also believes in
the power of benevolence—arguing
that ruling by example rather than
by fear would inspire the people to
follow a similarly virtuous life. The
same principle, he believes, should
govern personal relationships.

Loyalty and ritual
In his analysis of relationships,
Confucius uses zhong—the virtue
of loyalty—as a guiding principle.
To begin with, he stresses the
importance of the loyalty of a
minister to his sovereign, then
shows that a similar relation holds
between father and son, husband
and wife, elder brother and younger
brother, and between friends. The
order in which he arranges these is
signiﬁcant—political loyalty ﬁrst,
then family and clan loyalties, then
loyalties to friends and strangers.
For Confucius, this hierarchy
reﬂects the fact that each person
should know his station in society
as a whole, as well his place in the
family and the clan.
This aspect of “knowing one’s
station” is exempliﬁed by xiao—
ﬁlial piety—which for Confucius
was much more than just respect
for one’s parents or elders. In fact,
this is the closest he gets to
religious ideas in the Analects, for
xiao is connected to the traditional
practice of ancestor worship. Above
all, xiao reinforced the relationship
of inferior to superior, which was
central to his thinking.
It is in his insistence on li—
ritual propriety—that Confucius
is at his most conservative. Li did
not simply refer to rituals such as
ancestor worship, but also to the
social norms that underpinned
every aspect of contemporary
Chinese life. These ranged from
ceremonies such as marriages,

funerals, and sacriﬁces to the
etiquette of receiving guests,
presenting gifts, and the simple,
everyday gestures of politeness,
such as bowing and using the
correct mode of address. These are,
according to Confucius, the outward
signs of an inner de—but only when
they are performed with sincerity,
which he considers to be the way of
Heaven. Through the outward show
of loyalty with inner sincerity, the
superior man can transform society.

Sincerity
For Confucius, society can be
changed by example. As he writes:
“Sincerity becomes apparent.
From being apparent, it becomes
manifest. From being manifest,
it becomes brilliant. Brilliant, it
affects others. Affecting others,
they are changed by it. Changed by
it, they are transformed. Only he
who is possessed of the most
complete sincerity that can exist
under Heaven, can transform.”
Here, Confucius is at his least
conservative, and he explains that
the process of transformation can
work both ways. The concept of
zhong (faithfulness) also has an

implication of “regard for others.”
He took the view that one can learn
to become a superior man by ﬁrst
recognizing what one does not know
(an idea echoed a century later by
the Greek philosopher Socrates,
who claimed that his wisdom lay
in accepting that he knew nothing),
and then by watching other people:
if they show virtue, try to become
their equal; if they are inferior,
be their guide.

Self-reﬂection
This notion of zhong as a regard
for others is also tied to the last of
the Confucian values of de: shu,
reciprocity, or “self-reﬂection”, which
should govern our actions toward
others. The so-called Golden Rule,
“do as you would be done by”,
appears in Confucianism as a
negative: “what you do not desire
for yourself, do not do to others.”
The difference is subtle but crucial:
Confucius does not prescribe
what to do, only what not to do,
emphasizing restraint rather than

of establishing a humane society led
him to travel the Chinese empire for
12 years, teaching the virtues of
faithfulness and sincerity.

action. This implies modesty and
humility—values traditionally held
in high regard in Chinese society,
and which for Confucius express
our true nature. Fostering these
values is a form of loyalty to oneself,
and another kind of sincerity.

Confucianism
Confucius had little success in
persuading contemporary rulers to
adopt his ideas in government, and
turned his attention to teaching.
His disciples, including Meng Zi
(Mencius), continued to anthologize
and expand on his writings, which
survived the repressive Qin
Dynasty, and inspired a revival of
Confucianism in the Han Dynasty
of the early Common Era. From
then on, the impact of Confucius’s
ideas was profound, inspiring
almost every aspect of Chinese
society, from administration to
politics and philosophy. The major
religions of Daoism and Buddhism
had also been ﬂourishing in
Confucius’s time, replacing
traditional beliefs, and although
Confucius offered no opinion on

them, remaining silent about the
gods, he nevertheless inﬂuenced
aspects of both new faiths.
A Neo-Confucian school
revitalized the movement in the 9th
century, and reached its peak in the
12th century, when its inﬂuence
was felt across Southeast Asia into
Korea and Japan. Although Jesuit
missionaries brought back Kong
Fuzi’s ideas to Europe (and
Latinized his name to Confucius)
in the 16th century, Confucianism
was alien to European thought
and had limited inﬂuence until
translations of his work appeared
in the late 17th century.
Despite the fall of imperial
China in 1911, Confucian ideas
continued to form the basis of
many Chinese moral and social
conventions, even if they were
ofﬁcially frowned upon. In recent
years the People’s Republic of China
has shown a renewed interest in
Confucius, integrating his ideas
with both modern Chinese thought
and Western philosophy, creating
a hybrid philosophy known as
“New Confucianism.” ■

considers the logos to be a universal,

things come into being, and by
which all the material elements of
the universe are held in balance.
It is the balancing of opposites,

leads to the unity of the universe,
or the idea everything is part of a
single fundamental process or
substance—the central tenet of
monism. But he also states that
tension is constantly generated
between these pairs of opposites,
and he therefore concludes that
everything must be in a permanent
state of ﬂux, or change. Day, for
instance, changes into night, which
in turn changes back again to day.
Heraclitus offers the example
of a river to illustrate his theory:
“You can never step into the same
river twice.” By this, he means that
at the very moment you step into a
river, fresh waters will immediately
replace those into which you initially
placed your foot, and yet the river
itself is always described as one
ﬁxed and unchanging thing.
Heraclitus’s belief that every
object in the universe is in a state
of constant ﬂux runs counter to the
thinking of the philosophers of the
Milesian school, such as Thales
and Anaximenes, who deﬁne all
things by their quintessentially
unchanging essence. ■

Pythagoras, Parmenides employs
deductive reasoning in an attempt
to uncover the true physical nature
of the world. His investigations lead

exists (“It is”), Parmenides deduces
that it cannot also not exist (“It is

that a state of nothing existing is
impossible—there can be no void.
Something cannot then come from
nothing, and so must always have
existed in some form. This
permanent form cannot change,
because something that is
permanent cannot change into
something else without it ceasing
to be permanent. Fundamental
change is therefore impossible.

More importantly for subsequent
philosophers, Parmenides shows by
his process of reasoning that our
perception of the world is faulty and
full of contradictions. We seem to
experience change, and yet our
reason tells us that change is
impossible. The only conclusion
we can come to is that we can
never rely on the experience that

this way, he recognizes that belief
is subjective, and it is the man
holding the view or opinion that is
the measure of its worth. This style

politics at that time, was new to
philosophy. By placing human
beings at its center, it continued
a tradition of taking religion out
of philosophical argument, and it
also shifted the focus of philosophy
away from an understanding of
the nature of the universe to an
examination of human behavior.
Protagoras is mainly interested in
practical questions. Philosophical
speculations on the substance of
the cosmos or about the existence
of the gods seem pointless to him,
as he considers such things to be
ultimately unknowable.
The main implication of “man
is the measure of all things” is that
belief is subjective and relative.
This leads Protagoras to reject the
existence of absolute deﬁnitions
of truth, justice, or virtue. What is
true for one person may be false for
another, he claims. This relativism
also applies to moral values, such
as what is right and what is wrong.
To Protagoras, nothing is inherently
good in itself. Something is ethical,
or right, only because a person or
society judges it to be so.

Protagoras was the most inﬂuential
of a group of itinerant teachers of
law and rhetoric that became
known as the Sophists (from the
Greek sophia, meaning wisdom).
Socrates and Plato derided the
Sophists as mere rhetoricians,
but with Protagoras there was a
signiﬁcant step in ethics toward
the view that there are no absolutes
and that all judgements, including
moral judgements, are subjective. ■

Protagoras was born in Abdera,
in northeast Greece, but traveled
widely as an itinerant teacher. At
some stage, he moved to Athens,
where he became advisor to the
ruler of the city-state, Pericles,
who commissioned him to write
the constitution for the colony of
Thurii in 444 BCE. Protagoras was
a proponent of agnosticism, and
legend has it that he was later
tried for impiety, and that his
books were publicly burned.
Only fragments of his writings
survive, although Plato discusses
the views of Protagoras at length
in his dialogues.

Protagoras is believed to have
lived to the age of 70, but his
exact date and place of death
are unknown.

According to Protagoras, any “truth”
uncovered by these two philosophers,
depicted on a 5th-century BCE Greek
drinking vessel, will depend on their
use of rhetoric and their debating skill.

Plato, who recorded Socrates’ ideas
in a series of written works, called
dialogues, in which Socrates sets
about examining various ideas. It is
largely thanks to these dialogues—
which include the Apology, Phaedo,
and the Symposium—that Socrates’
thought survived at all, and that it
went on to guide the course of
Western philosophy.

The purpose of life
Socrates lived in Athens in the
second half of the 5th century BCE.
As a young man he is believed to

have studied natural philosophy,
looking at the various explanations
of the nature of the universe, but
then became involved in the politics
of the city-state and concerned
with more down-to-earth ethical
issues, such as the nature of justice.
However, he was not interested in
winning arguments, or arguing
for the sake of making money—a
charge that was leveled at many of
his contemporaries. Nor was he
seeking answers or explanations—
he was simply examining the
basis of the concepts we apply to
ourselves (such as “good”, “bad”,
and “just”), for he believed that
understanding what we are is
the ﬁrst task of philosophy. ❯❯

Socrates
Born in Athens in 469 BCE,
Socrates was the son of a
stonemason and a midwife.
It is likely that he pursued his
father’s profession, and had
the opportunity to study
philosophy, before he was
called up for military service.
After distinguishing himself
during the Peloponnesian War,
he returned to Athens, and for
a while involved himself in
politics. However, when his
father died he inherited
enough money to live with
his wife Xanthippe without
having to work.
From then on, Socrates
became a familiar sight around
Athens, involving himself in
philosophical discussions with
fellow citizens and gaining a
following of young students.
He was eventually accused of
corrupting the minds of young
Athenians, and was sentenced
to death. Although he was
offered the choice of exile, he
accepted the guilty verdict
and was given a fatal dose
of hemlock in 399 BCE.

48 SOCRATES

I am a citizen
of the world.
Socrates

Q. So you think
that the gods
know everything?

Socrates’ central concern, then,
was the examination of life, and it
was his ruthless questioning of
people’s most cherished beliefs
(largely about themselves) that
earned him his enemies—but he
remained committed to his task
until the very end. According to the
account of his defence at his trial,
recorded by Plato, Socrates chose
death rather than face a life of
ignorance: “The life which is
unexamined is not worth living.”
Socrates’ dialectical method
was a simple method of questioning
that brought to light the often false
assumptions on which particular
claims to knowledge are based.

A. Yes, because
they are gods.
Q. Do some gods
disagree with others?

Q. So gods disagree
about what is
true and right?

A. Yes, of course
they do. They are
always ﬁghting.

A. I suppose
they must do.
Q. So some gods
can be wrong
sometimes?

A. I suppose
that is true.

Therefore the gods
cannot know
everything!

But what exactly is involved in this
examination of life? For Socrates it
was a process of questioning the
meaning of essential concepts that
we use every day but have never
really thought about, thereby
revealing their real meaning and
our own knowledge or ignorance.
Socrates was one of the ﬁrst
philosophers to consider what it
was that constituted a “good” life;
for him it meant achieving peace of
mind as a result of doing the right
thing, rather than living according to
the moral codes of society. And the
“right thing” can only be determined
through rigorous examination.
Socrates rejected the notion
that concepts such as virtue were
relative, insisting instead that they
were absolutes, applicable not just to
citizens of Athens, or Greece, but to
all people in the world. He believed
that virtue (areté in Greek, which at
the time implied excellence and
fulﬁlment) was “the most valuable
of possessions”, and that no-one
actually desires to do evil. Anyone
performing evil actions would be
acting against their conscience and
would therefore feel uncomfortable;
and as we all strive for peace of
mind it is not something we would
do willingly. Evil, he thought, was
done because of lack of wisdom and
knowledge. From this he concluded
that “there is only one good:
knowledge; and one evil: ignorance.”
Knowledge is inextricably bound to
morality—it is the “only one
good”—and for this reason we must
continually “examine” our lives.

Care of the soul
For Socrates, knowledge may also
play a part in life after death. In the
Apology, Plato’s Socrates prefaces
his famous quote about the
unexamined life by saying: “I tell
you that to let no day pass without
discussing goodness and all the

THE ANCIENT WORLD 49
other subjects about which you
hear me talking, and that examining
both myself and others is really the
very best thing a man can do.”
This gaining of knowledge, rather
than wealth or high status, is the
ultimate goal of life. It is not a matter
of entertainment or curiosity—it is
the reason why we exist. Moreover,
all knowledge is ultimately selfknowledge, for it creates the person
you are within this world, and
fosters the care of the immortal soul.
In Phaedo, Socrates says that an
unexamined life leads the soul to
be “confused and dizzy, as if it
were drunk”, while the wise soul
achieves stability, its straying
ﬁnally brought to an end.

Dialectical method
Socrates quickly became a wellknown ﬁgure in Athens, with a
reputation for an enquiring mind.
A friend of his, so the story goes,
asked the priestess of Apollo at
Delphi who the wisest man in the
world was: the oracular reply was
that there was no-one wiser than
Socrates. When Socrates heard
about this, he was astounded, and
went to the most knowledgeable
people he could ﬁnd to try to
disprove it. What he discovered
was that these people only thought
they knew a great deal; under
examination, their knowledge was
proved to be either limited or false.
What was more important,
however, was the method he used
to question their knowledge. He
took the standpoint of someone who
knew nothing, and merely asked
questions, exposing contradictions
in arguments and gaps in knowledge
Socrates was put to death in 399 BCE,
ultimately for questioning the basis of
Athenian morality. Here he accepts the
bowl of hemlock that will kill him, and
gestures deﬁantly at the heavens.

to gradually elicit insights. He
likened the process to his mother’s
profession of midwife, assisting
in the birth of ideas.
Through these discussions,
Socrates came to realize that the
Delphic oracle had been right –
he was the wisest man in Athens,
not because of his knowledge but
because he professed to know
nothing. He also saw that the
inscription on the entrance to the
temple at Delphi, gnothi seauton
(“know thyself”), was just as
signiﬁcant. To gain knowledge
of the world and oneself it was
necessary to realize the limits of
one’s own ignorance and to remove
all preconceptions. Only then could
one hope to determine the truth.
Socrates set about engaging the
people of Athens in discussion on
topics such as the nature of love,
justice, and loyalty. His mission,
misunderstood at the time as a
dangerous form of Sophistry—or
cleverness for the sake of it—was
not to instruct the people, nor even
simply to learn what they knew, but
to explore the ideas that they had.
It was the conversation itself, with
Socrates guiding it, that provided
him with insights. Through a series
of questions, he revealed the ideas
and assumptions his opponent held,

I know nothing except
the fact of my ignorance.
Socrates

then exposed the contradictions
within them and brought them to
agree to a new set of conclusions.
This method of examining an
argument by rational discussion
from a position of ignorance marked
a complete change in philosophical
thinking. It was the ﬁrst known
use of inductive argument, in
which a set of premises based
on experience is ﬁrst established
to be true, and then shown to lead
to a universal truth in conclusion.
This powerful form of argument
was developed by Aristotle, and
later by Francis Bacon, who used
it as the starting point of his
scientiﬁc method. It became,
therefore, the foundation not
only of Western philosophy, but
of all the empirical sciences. ■

I

n 399 BCE, Plato’s mentor
Socrates was condemned to
death. Socrates had left no
writings, and Plato took it upon
himself to preserve what he had
learnt from his master for
posterity—ﬁrst in the Apology, his
retelling of Socrates’ defense at his
trial, and later by using Socrates as
a character in a series of dialogues.
In these dialogues, it is sometimes
difﬁcult to untangle which are
Socrates’ thoughts and which are
the original thoughts of Plato, but a
picture emerges of Plato using the
methods of his master to explore
and explain his own ideas.

We recognize things in the world,
such as dogs, because we recognize
they are imperfect copies of the
concepts in our minds.

Everything in this world is
a “shadow” of its Ideal Form
in the world of Ideas.

Initially Plato’s concerns were very
much those of his mentor: to search
for deﬁnitions of abstract moral
values such as “justice” and
“virtue”, and to refute Protagoras’s
notion that right and wrong are
relative terms. In the Republic,
Plato set out his vision of the ideal
city-state and explored aspects of
virtue. But in the process, he also
tackled subjects outside moral
philosophy. Like earlier Greek
thinkers, he questioned the nature
and substance of the cosmos, and
explored how the immutable and
eternal could exist in a seemingly
changing world. However, unlike

his predecessors, Plato concluded
that the “unchanging” in nature is
the same as the “unchanging” in
morals and society.

Seeking the Ideal
In the Republic, Plato describes
Socrates posing questions about
the virtues, or moral concepts, in
order to establish clear and precise
deﬁnitions of them. Socrates had
famously said that “virtue is
knowledge”, and that to act justly,
for example, you must ﬁrst ask what
justice is. Plato decides that before
referring to any moral concept in
our thinking or reasoning, we must

St. Augustine of Hippo 72–73

■

Heraclitus 40

ﬁrst explore both what we mean by
that concept and what makes it
precisely the kind of thing that it is.
He raises the question of how we
would recognize the correct, or
perfect, form of anything—a form
that is true for all societies and for
all time. By doing so, Plato is
implying that he thinks some kind
of ideal form of things in the world
we inhabit—whether those things
are moral concepts or physical
objects—must actually exist, of
which we are in some way aware.
Plato talks about objects in the
world around us, such as beds.
When we see a bed, he states, we
know that it is a bed and we can
recognize all beds, even though
they may differ in numerous ways.
Dogs in their many species are
even more varied, yet all dogs share
the characteristic of “dogginess”,
which is something we can
recognize, and that allows us to
say we know what a dog is. Plato
argues that it is not just that a
shared “dogginess” or “bedness”
exists, but that we all have in our
minds an idea of an ideal bed or
dog, which we use to recognize any
particular instance.
Taking a mathematical example
to further his argument, Plato shows
that true knowledge is reached by
reasoning, rather than through our
senses. He states that we can work
out in logical steps that the square
of the hypotenuse of a right-angled
triangle is equal to the sum of the
squares of the other two sides, or
that the sum of the three interior
The Allegory of the Cave, in which
knowledge of the world is limited to

angles of any triangle is always
180 degrees. We know the truth of
these statements, even though the
perfect triangle does not exist
anywhere in the natural world. Yet
we are able to perceive the perfect
triangle—or the perfect straight
line or circle—in our minds, using
our reason. Plato, therefore, asks
whether such perfect forms can
exist anywhere.

World of Ideas
Reasoning brings Plato to only one
conclusion—that there must be a
world of Ideas, or Forms, which is
totally separate from the material
world. It is there that the Idea of the
perfect “triangle”, along with the
Idea of the perfect “bed” and “dog”
exists. He concludes that human
senses cannot perceive this place
directly—it is only perceptible to us
through reason. Plato even goes on
to state that this realm of Ideas is
“reality”, and that the world around
us is merely modelled upon it.
To illustrate his theory, Plato
presents what has become known
as the “Allegory of the Cave.” He

asks us to imagine a cave in which
people have been imprisoned since
birth, tied up facing the back wall
in the darkness. They can only face
straight ahead. Behind the prisoners
is a bright ﬁre, which casts shadows
onto the wall they are facing. There
is also a rampart between the ﬁre
and the prisoners along which
people walk and hold up various
objects from time to time, so that
the shadows of these objects are
cast on the wall. These shadows
are all the prisoners know of the ❯❯

54 PLATO
According to Plato’s theory of Forms, every
horse that we encounter in the world around us is
a lesser version of an “ideal”, or perfect, horse that
exists in a world of Forms or Ideas—a realm that
humans can only access through
their ability to reason.

The world
d of ideas

other of what Plato considers to be
reality, also solves the problem of
ﬁnding constants in an apparently
changing world. The material world
may be subject to change, but
Plato’s world of Ideas is eternal and
immutable. Plato applies his theory
not just to concrete things, such as
beds and dogs, but also to abstract
concepts. In Plato’s world of Ideas,
there is an Idea of justice, which is
true justice, and all the instances of
justice in the material world around
us are models, or lesser variants, of
it. The same is true of the concept
of goodness, which Plato considers
to be the ultimate Idea—and the
goal of all philosophical enquiry.

Innate knowledge

The world of the senses
world; they have no concept of the
actual objects themselves. If one
of the prisoners manages to untie
himself and turn around, he will
see the objects themselves. But
after a lifetime of entrapment, he
is likely to be confused, as well as
dazzled by the ﬁre, and will most
likely turn back toward the wall
and the only reality he knows.
Plato believes that everything
that our senses perceive in the
material world is like the images
on the cave wall, merely shadows
of reality. This belief is the basis
of his theory of Forms, which is that
for every earthly thing that we have

the power to perceive with our
senses, there is a corresponding
“Form” (or “Idea”)—an eternal and
perfect reality of that thing—in the
world of Ideas. Because what we
perceive via our senses is based
on an experience of imperfect or
incomplete “shadows” of reality,
we can have no real knowledge of
those things. At best, we may have
opinions, but genuine knowledge
can only come from study of the
Ideas, and that can only ever be
achieved through reason, rather
than through our deceptive senses.
This separation of two distinct
worlds, one of appearance, the

The problem remains of how we
can come to know these Ideas, so
that we have the ability to recognize
the imperfect instances of them in
the world we inhabit. Plato argues
that our conception of Ideal Forms
must be innate, even if we are not
aware of this. He believes that
human beings are divided into two
parts: the body and the soul. Our
bodies possess the senses, through
which we are able to perceive the
material world, while the soul
possesses the reason with which
we can perceive the realm of Ideas.

inhabited the world of Ideas before
our birth, and still yearns to return
to that realm after our death. So
when we see variations of the Ideas
in the world with our senses, we
recognize them as a sort of
recollection. Recalling the innate

Plato

memories of these Ideas requires
reason—an attribute of the soul.
For Plato, the philosopher’s job
is to use reason to discover the
Ideal Forms or Ideas. In the
Republic, he also argues that it is
philosophers, or rather those who
are true to the philosopher’s calling,
who should be the ruling class.
This is because only the true
philosopher can understand the
exact nature of the world and the
truth of moral values. However, just
like a prisoner in the “Allegory of
the Cave” who sees the real objects
rather than their shadows, many
will just turn back to the only world
they feel comfortable with. Plato
often found it difﬁcult to convince
his fellow philosophers of the true
nature of their calling.

Unsurpassed legacy
Plato himself was the embodiment
of his ideal, or true, philosopher. He
argued on questions of ethics that
had been raised previously by the
followers of Protagoras and Socrates,
but in the process, he explored for
the ﬁrst time the path to knowledge
itself. He was a profound inﬂuence
on his pupil Aristotle—even if they
fundamentally disagreed about the
Despite the large proportion of
writings attributed to Plato that
have survived, little is known
about his life. He was born into a
noble family in Athens in around

acquired the nickname “Plato”
(meaning “broad”). Although
probably destined for a life in

ristotle was 17 years old
when he arrived in Athens
to study at the Academy
under the great philosopher Plato.
Plato himself was 60 at the time,
and had already devised his theory
of Forms. According to this theory,
all earthly phenomena, such as
justice and the color green, are
shadows of ideal counterparts, called
Forms, which give their earthly
models their particular identities.
Aristotle was a studious type,
and no doubt learnt a great deal from
his master, but he was also of a very
different temperament. Where Plato
was brilliant and intuitive, Aristotle
was scholarly and methodical.
Nevertheless, there was an obvious
mutual respect, and Aristotle stayed
at the Academy, both as a student
and a teacher, until Plato died 20
years later. Surprisingly, he was not
chosen as Plato’s successor, and so
he left Athens and took what would
prove to be a fruitful trip to Ionia.

Plato’s theory questioned
The break from teaching gave
Aristotle the opportunity to indulge
his passion for studying wildlife,
which intensiﬁed his feeling that
Plato’s theory of Forms was wrong.

It is tempting to imagine that
Aristotle’s arguments had already
had some inﬂuence on Plato, who
in his later dialogues admitted
some ﬂaws in his earlier theories,
but it is impossible to know for
certain. We do know, though, that
Plato was aware of the Third Man
argument, which Aristotle used to
refute his theory of Forms. This
argument runs as follows: if there
exists in a realm of Forms a perfect
Form of Man on which earthly men
are modelled, this Form, to have
any conceivable content, would
have to be based on a Form of the
Form of Man—and this too would
have to be based on a higher Form
on which the Forms of the Forms
are based, and so on ad inﬁnitum.
Aristotle’s later argument
against the theory of Forms was
more straightforward, and more
directly related to his studies of the
natural world. He realized that it
was simply unnecessary to assume
that there is a hypothetical realm
of Forms, when the reality of things
can already be seen here on Earth,
inherent in everyday things.
Perhaps because his father
had been a physician, Aristotle’s
scientiﬁc interests lay in what we

characteristics are that make
things what they are—and
the only way of experiencing
the world is through our senses.

The essential form of things

now call the biological sciences,
whereas Plato’s background had
been ﬁrmly based in mathematics.
This difference in background
helps to explain the difference in
approach between the two men.
Mathematics, especially geometry,
deals with abstract concepts that
are far removed from the everyday
world, whereas biology is very much
about the world around us, and is
based almost solely on observation.
Plato sought conﬁrmation of a realm
of Forms from notions such as the
perfect circle (which cannot exist
in nature), but Aristotle found that
certain constants can be discovered
by examining the natural world.

Trusting the senses
What Aristotle proposed turned
Plato’s theory on its head. Far from
mistrusting our senses, Aristotle
relied on them for the evidence

to back up his theories. What he
learnt from studying the natural
world was that by observing the
characteristics of every example
of a particular plant or animal that
he came across, he could build up
a complete picture of what it was
that distinguished it from other
plants or animals, and deduce what
makes it what it is. His own studies
conﬁrmed what he already
believed—that we are not born
with an innate ability to recognize
Forms, as Plato maintained.
Each time a child comes across
a dog, for example, it notes what it
is about that animal that it has in
common with other dogs, so that
it can eventually recognize the
things that make something a
dog. The child now has an idea
of “dogginess”, or the “form”, as
Aristotle puts it, of a dog. In this
way, we learn from our experience

Like Plato, then, Aristotle is
concerned with ﬁnding some kind of
immutable and eternal bedrock in a
world characterized by change, but
he concludes that there is no need
to look for this anchor in a world of
Forms that are only perceptible to
the soul. The evidence is here in the
world around us, perceptible through
the senses. Aristotle believes that
things in the material world are not
imperfect copies of some ideal
Form of themselves, but that the
essential form of a thing is actually
inherent in each instance of that
thing. For example, “dogginess”
is not just a shared characteristic
of dogs—it is something that is
inherent in each and every dog. ❯❯

60 ARISTOTLE

All men by nature
desire to know.
Aristotle

Aristotle classiﬁed many of the
different strands of knowledge and
learning that we have today, such
as physics, logic, metaphysics, poetics,
ethics, politics, and biology.

By studying particular things,
therefore, we can gain insight into
their universal, immutable nature.
What is true of examples in the
natural world, Aristotle reasons,
is also true of concepts relating
to human beings. Notions such
as “virtue”, “justice”, “beauty”, and
“good” can be examined in exactly
the same way. As he sees it, when
we are born our minds are like
“unscribed tablets”, and any ideas
that we gain can only be received
through our senses. At birth, we
have no innate ideas, so we can
have no idea of right or wrong. As
we encounter instances of justice
throughout our lives, however, we
learn to recognize the qualities that
these instances have in common,
and slowly build and reﬁne our
understanding of what justice is.
In other words, the only way we
can come to know the eternal,
immutable idea of justice, is by
observing how it is manifested
in the world around us.
Aristotle departs from Plato,
then, not by denying that universal
qualities exist, but by questioning
both their nature and the means

by which we come to know them
(the latter being the fundamental
quesion of “epistemology”, or the
theory of knowledge). And it was
this difference of opinion on how
we arrive at universal truths that
later divided philosophers into two
separate camps: the rationalists
(including René Descartes,
Immanuel Kant, and Gottfried
Leibniz), who believe in a priori,
or innate, knowledge; and the
empiricists (including John Locke,
George Berkeley, and David Hume),
who claim that all knowledge
comes from experience.

Biological classiﬁcation
The manner in which Plato and
Aristotle arrive at their theories tells
us much about their temperaments.
Plato’s theory of Forms is grand and
otherworldly, which is reﬂected in
the way he argues his case, using
highly imaginative ﬁctionalized
dialogues between Socrates and
his contemporaries. By contrast,
Aristotle’s theory is much more
down to earth, and is presented in
more prosaic, academic language.
Indeed, so convinced was Aristotle

that the truth of the world is to be
found here on Earth, and not in
some higher dimension, that he set
about collecting specimens of ﬂora
and fauna, and classiﬁed them
according to their characteristics.
For this biological classiﬁcation,
Aristotle devised a hierarchical
system—the ﬁrst of its kind, and so
beautifully constructed that it forms
the basis of the taxonomy still in
use today. First, he divides the
natural world into living and
nonliving things, then he turns his
attention to classifying the living
world. His next division is between
plants and animals, which involves
the same kind of thinking that
underpins his theory of universal
qualities: we may be able to
distinguish between a plant and
an animal almost without thinking,
but how do we know how to make
that distinction? The answer, for
Aristotle, is in the shared features
of either category. All plants share
the form “plant”, and all animals
share the form “animal.” And once
we understand the nature of those
forms, we can then recognize them
in each and every instance.
This fact becomes more apparent
the more Aristotle subdivides the
natural world. In order to classify a
specimen as a ﬁsh, for example, we
have to recognize what it is that
makes a ﬁsh a ﬁsh—which, again,
can be known through experience
and requires no innate knowledge
at all. As Aristotle builds up a
complete classiﬁcation of all living
things, from the simplest organisms
to human beings, this fact is
conﬁrmed again and again.

Teleological explanation
Another fact that became obvious
to Aristotle as he classiﬁed the
natural world is that the “form”
of a creature is not just a matter
of its physical characteristics, such

THE ANCIENT WORLD 61
as its skin, fur, feather, or scales,
but also a matter of what it does,
and how it behaves—which, for
Aristotle, has ethical implications.
To understand the link with
ethics, we need ﬁrst to appreciate
that for Aristotle everything in
the world is fully explained by four
causes that fully account for a
thing’s existence. These four causes
are: the material cause, or what a
thing is made of; the formal cause,
or the arrangement or shape of a

thing; the efﬁcient cause, or how
a thing is brought into being; and
the ﬁnal cause, or the function or
purpose of a thing. And it is this
last type of cause, the “ﬁnal cause”,
that relates to ethics—a subject
which, for Aristotle, is not separate
from science, but rather a logical
extension of biology.
An example that Aristotle gives
is that of an eye: the ﬁnal cause
of an eye—its function—is to see.
This function is the purpose, or

the ﬁrst detailed examination of the natural world.
It proceeds from general observations about the
characteristics shared by all animals, and then
subdivides into ever more precise categories.

telos, of the eye—telos is a Greek
word that gives us “teleology”, or
the study of purpose in nature. A
teleological explanation of a thing
is therefore an account of a thing’s
purpose, and to know the purpose
of a thing is also to know what a
“good” or a “bad” version of a thing
is—a good eye for example, is one
that sees well.
In the case of humans, a “good”
life is therefore one in which we
fulﬁll our purpose, or use all the
characteristics that make us
human to the full. A person can be
considered “good” if he uses the
characteristics he was born with,
and can only be happy by using all
his capabilities in the pursuit of
virtue—the highest form of which,
for Aristotle, is wisdom. Which
brings us full circle back to the
question of how we can recognize
the thing that we call virtue—and
for Aristotle, again, the answer is
by observation. We understand the
nature of the “good life” by seeing
it in the people around us.

The syllogism

“Socrates is mortal” is the undeniable conclusion
to the most famous syllogism in history. Aristotle’s
syllogism—a simple deduction from two premises
to a conclusion—was the ﬁrst formal system of logic.

whether it belongs to a certain
category. For example, one of the
characteristics common to all
reptiles is that they are cold-blooded;
so, if this particular specimen is
warm-blooded, then it cannot be a
reptile. Likewise, a characteristic
common to all mammals is that
they suckle their young; so, if this
specimen is a mammal, it will suckle
its young. Aristotle sees a pattern
in this way of thinking—that of
three propositions consisting of
two premises and a conclusion, for
example in the form: if As are Xs,
and B is an A, then B is an X.
The “syllogism”, as this form of
reasoning is known, is the ﬁrst
formal system of logic ever devised,
and it remained the basic model for
logic up until the 19th century.
But the syllogism was more than
simply a by-product of Aristotle’s
systematic classiﬁcation of the
natural world. By using analytical
reasoning in the form of logic,
Aristotle realized that the power
of reason was something that did
not rely on the senses, and that
it must therefore be an innate
characteristic—part of what it is
to be human. Although we have no
innate ideas, we do possess this

innate faculty, which is necessary
for us to learn from experience.
And as he applied this fact to his
hierarchical system, he saw that
the innate power of reason is what
distinguishes us from all other
living creatures, and placed us at
the top of the hierarchy.

Decline of Classical Greece
The sheer scope of Aristotle’s ideas,
and the revolutionary way in which
he overturns Plato’s theory of Forms,
should have ensured that his
philosophy had a far greater impact
than it did during his lifetime. That
is not to say that his work was
without fault—his geography and
astronomy were ﬂawed; his ethics
supported the use of slaves and
considered women to be inferior
human beings; and his logic was
incomplete by modern standards.
However, what he got right
amounted to a revolution both
in philosophy and in science.
But Aristotle lived at the end of
an era. Alexander the Great, whom
he taught, died shortly before him,
and so began the Hellenistic period
of Greek history which saw a decline
in Athens’ inﬂuence. The Roman
Empire was becoming the dominant

power in the Mediterranean, and the
philosophy it adopted from Greece
was that of the Stoics. The rival
schools of Plato and Aristotle—
Plato’s Academy and the Lyceum
Aristotle founded in Athens—
continued to operate, but they
had lost their former eminence.
As a result of this neglect, many
of Aristotle’s writings were lost. It
is believed that he wrote several
hundred treatises and dialogues
explaining his theories, but all that
remain are fragments of his work,
mainly in the form of lectures and
teacher’s notes. Luckily for posterity,
these were preserved by his
followers, and there is enough
contained in them to give a picture
of the full range of his work.

Aristotle’s legacy
With the emergence of Islam in the
7th century CE, Aristotle’s works
were translated into Arabic and
spread throughout the Islamic world,
becoming essential reading for
Middle Eastern scholars such as
Avicenna and Averroes. In Western
Europe, however, Boethius’s Latin
translation of Aristotle’s treatise on
logic (made in the 6th century CE)
remained the only work of Aristotle’s

available until the 9th century CE,
when all of Aristotle’s works began
to be translated from Arabic into
Latin. It was also at this time that
his ideas were collected into the
the books we know today—such as
Physics, The Nicomachean Ethics,

Aristotle

and the Organon. In the 13th
century, Thomas Aquinas braved
a ban on Aristotle’s work and
integrated it into Christian
philosophy, in the same way that
St. Augustine had adopted Plato,
and Plato and Aristotle came to
lock horns again.
Aristotle’s notes on logic (laid
out in the Organon) remained the
standard text on logic until the
emergence of mathematical logic
in the 19th century. Likewise,
his classiﬁcation of living things
dominated Western thinking
throughout the Middle Ages,
becoming the Christian scala
naturae (the “ladder of nature”),
or the Great Chain of Being. This
depicted the whole of creation
dominated by man, who stood
second only to God. And during the
Renaissance, Aristotle’s empirical
method of enquiry held sway.
In the 17th century, the debate
between empiricists and rationalists
reached its zenith after René
Descartes published his Discourse
on the Method. Descartes, and
Leibniz and Kant after him, chose
the rationalist route; in response,
Locke, Berkeley, and Hume lined
up as the empiricist opposition.
Born in Stagira, Chalcidice, in
the northeast region of modern
Greece, Aristotle was the son of
a physician to the royal family
of Macedon, and was educated as
a member of the aristocracy. He
was sent to Plato’s Academy in
Athens at the age of 17, and spent
almost 20 years there both as a
student and a teacher. When
Plato died, Aristotle left Athens
for Ionia, and spent several years
studying the wildlife of the area.
He was then appointed tutor at
the Macedonian court, where he
taught the young Alexander the
Great and continued his studies.

There is nothing in

Again, the differences between the
philosophers were as much about
temperament as they were about
substance—the Continental versus
the English, the poetic versus the
academic, the Platonic versus the
Aristotelian. Although the debate
died down in the 19th century,
there has been a revival of interest
in Aristotle in recent times, and
a reappraisal of his signiﬁcance.
His ethics in particular have
been of great appeal to modern
philosophers, who have seen in
his functional deﬁnition of “good”
a key to understanding the way
we use ethical language. ■
In 335 BCE he returned to Athens,
encouraged by Alexander, and
set up the Lyceum, a school to
rival Plato’s. It was here that
he did most of his writing, and
formalized his ideas. After
Alexander died in 323 BCE,
anti-Macedonian feeling ﬂared
up in Athens, and Aristotle
ﬂed to Chalcis, on the island
of Euboea, where he died
the following year.

Late 5th century BCE

atoms, moving in empty space.

E

picurus grew up in a time
when the philosophy of
ancient Greece had already
reached a pinnacle in the ideas of
Plato and Aristotle. The main focus
of philosophical thinking was
shifting from metaphysics toward
ethics—and also from political to
personal ethics. Epicurus, however,
found the seeds of a new school of
thought in the quests of earlier
philosophers, such as Socrates’
examination of the truth of basic
human concepts and values.

AFTER
c.50 BCE Roman philosopher
Lucretius writes De rerum
natura, a poem exploring
Epicurus’s ideas.

Fear of death

1789 Jeremy Bentham
advocates the utilitarian idea
of “the greatest happiness for
the greatest number.”
1861 John Stuart Mill argues
that intellectual and spiritual
pleasures have more value
than physical pleasures.

Central to the philosophy that
Epicurus developed is the view
that peace of mind, or tranquillity,
is the goal of life. He argues that
pleasure and pain are the roots of
good and evil, and qualities such
as virtue and justice derive from
these roots, as “it is impossible to
live a pleasant life without living
wisely, honorably, and justly, and
it is impossible to live wisely,
honorably, and justly without living
pleasantly.” Epicurianism is often
mistakenly interpreted as simply
being about the pursuit of sensual
pleasures. For Epicurus, the
greatest pleasure is only attainable
through knowledge and friendship,
and a temperate life, with freedom
from fear and pain.

Terrifying images of the merciless
god of death Thanatos were used to
depict the pain and torment ancient
Greeks might incur for their sins, both
when they died and in the afterlife.

One of the obstacles to enjoying the
peace of a tranquil mind, Epicurus
reasons, is the fear of death, and
this fear is increased by the
religious belief that if you incur
the wrath of the gods, you will be
severely punished in the afterlife.
But rather than countering this fear
by proposing an alternative state
of immortality, Epicurus tries to
explain the nature of death itself.
He starts by proposing that when

we die, we are unaware of our
death, since our consciousness
(our soul) ceases to exist at the
point of death. To explain this,
Epicurus takes the view that the
entire universe consists of either
atoms or empty space, as argued
by the atomist philosophers
Democritus and Leucippus.
Epicurus then reasons that the soul
could not be empty space, because
it operates dynamically with the
body, so it must be made up of
atoms. He describes these atoms
of the soul as being distributed
around the body, but as being so
fragile that they dissolve when
we die, and so we are no longer
capable of sensing anything. If you

are unable to feel anything, mentally
or physically, when you die, it is
foolish to let the fear of death cause
you pain while you are still alive.
Epicurus attracted a small but
devoted following in his lifetime,
but he was perceived as being
dismissive of religion, which made
him unpopular. His thinking was
largely ignored by mainstream
philosophy for centuries, but it
resurfaced in the 18th century, in
the ideas of Jeremy Bentham and
John Stuart Mill. In revolutionary
politics, the tenets of Epicureanism
are echoed in the words of the
United States’ Declaration of
Independence: “life, liberty, and
the pursuit of happiness.” ■

Born to Athenian parents on
the Aegean island of Samos,
Epicurus was ﬁrst taught
philosophy by a disciple of
Plato. In 323 BCE, Alexander
the Great died and, in the
political conﬂicts that
followed, Epicurus and his
family were forced to move
to Colophon (now in Turkey).
There he continued his studies
with Nausiphanes, a follower
of Democritus.
Epicurus taught brieﬂy
in Mytilene on the island of
Lesbos, and in Lampsacus on
the Greek mainland, before
moving to Athens in 306 BCE.
He founded a school, known
as the The Garden, consisting
of a community of friends and
followers. There he set down
in great detail the philosophy
that was to become known
as Epicureanism.
Despite frequent ill health,
and often being in great pain,
Epicurus lived to the age
of 72. True to his beliefs, he
described the last day of his
life as a truly happy day.

without shame, and renouncing
the desire for property and comfort.

death. These were the hedonistic,
godless ethic of Epicurus, which
had limited appeal, and the more
popular and longer-lasting Stoicism
of Zeno of Citium.
Zeno studied with a disciple of
Diogenes of Sinope, the Cynic, and
shared his no-nonsense approach
to life. He had little patience with
metaphysical speculation and came
to believe that the cosmos was
governed by natural laws that were
ordained by a supreme lawgiver.
Man, he declares, is completely
powerless to change this reality,
and in addition to enjoying its
many beneﬁts, man also has to
accept its cruelty and injustice.

control, and be indifferent to pain
and pleasure, poverty and riches.
But if a person does so, Zeno is
convinced that he will achieve a
life that is in harmony with nature
in all its aspects, good or bad, and
live in accordance with the rulings
of the supreme lawgiver.
Stoicism was to ﬁnd favor across
much of Hellenistic Greece. But it
drew in even more followers in the
expanding Roman empire, where it
ﬂourished as a basis for ethics—
both personal and political—until it
was supplanted by Christianity in
the 6th century. ■

hilosophy did not play a
large part in Roman culture,
other than Stoicism, which
was admired by the Romans for
its emphasis on virtuous conduct
and doing one’s duty. The broader
philosophical tradition that had
been established by the Classical
Greeks was therefore effectively
marginalized under the Roman
Empire. Philosophy continued to be
taught in Athens, but its inﬂuence
dwindled, and no signiﬁcant
philosophers emerged until Plotinus
in the 3rd century CE, who founded
an important Neo-Platonist school.
During the ﬁrst millennium of
the Common Era, Roman inﬂuence
also waned, both politically and
culturally. Christianity became
assimilated into the Roman culture,
and after the fall of the empire in
the 5th century, the Church

became the dominant authority in
Western Europe, remaining so for
almost 1,000 years. The Greek idea
of philosophy as rational examination
independent of religious doctrine
sat uncomfortably with the rise of
Christianity. Questions about the
nature of the universe and what
constitutes a virtuous life were held
to be answered in the scriptures;
they were not considered subjects
for philosophical discussion.
Early Christian philosophers such
as St. Augustine of Hippo sought
to integrate Greek philosophy into
the Christian religion. This process
was the main task of scholasticism,
a philosophical approach that
stemmed from the monastic schools
and was renowned for its rigorous
dialectical reasoning. The work of
scholastic philosophers such as
Augustine was not so much an

exploration of questions such as
“Is there a God?” or “Does man
have an immortal soul?” as a search
for a rational justiﬁcation for the
belief in God and an immortal soul.

The Dark Ages
As the Roman Empire shrank and
eventually fell, Europe sank into the
“Dark Ages” and most of the culture
it had inherited from Greece and
Rome disappeared. The Church
held the monopoly on learning,
and the only true philosophy that
survived was a form of Platonism
deemed compatible with
Christianity, and Boethius’s
translation of Aristotle’s Logic.
Elsewhere, however, culture
thrived. China and Japan in
particular enjoyed a “Golden Age”
of poetry and art, while traditional
eastern philosophies coexisted

happily with their religions. In
the lands that had been part of
Alexander the Great’s empire, the
Greek legacy commanded more
respect than in Europe. Arabic and
Persian scholars preserved and
translated the works of the Classical
Greek philosophers, incorporating
their ideas into Islamic culture from
the 6th century onward.
As Islam spread eastward into
Asia and across north Africa and
into Spain, its inﬂuence began to be
felt in Europe. By the 12th century,
news of ideas and inventions from
the Islamic world were reaching as
far north as Britain, and European
scholars started to rediscover
Greek mathematics and philosophy
through Islamic sources. The works
of Aristotle in particular came as
something of a revelation, and they
sparked a resurgence of philosophical

thinking within the medieval
Christian Church. But whereas
Plato’s philosophy had been
comparatively easy to assimilate
into Christian thought, because it
provided rational justiﬁcation for
belief in God and the immortal
human soul, Aristotle was treated
with suspicion by the Church
authorities. Nevertheless, Christian
philosophers including Roger
Bacon, Thomas Aquinas, Duns
Scotus, and William of Ockham
enthusiastically embraced the new
Aristotelianism and eventually
convinced the Church of its
compatibility with Christian faith.

A new rationality
Along with the philosophy that
revitalized the Church, the Islamic
world also introduced a wealth of
technological and scientiﬁc

knowledge to medieval Europe.
Aristotle’s scientiﬁc methods had
been reﬁned to sophisticated levels
in Persia, and advances in chemistry,
physics, medicine, and particularly
astronomy undermined the authority
of the Church when they arrived
in Europe.
The re-introduction of Greek
thinking and the new ideas that led
to Europe’s Renaissance in the late
15th century sparked a change of
mood as people began to look more
toward reason rather than faith to
provide them with answers. There
was dissent even within the
Church, as humanists such as
Erasmus provoked the Reformation.
Philosophers themselves turned
their attention away from questions
of God and the immortal soul
toward the problems posed by
science and the natural world. ■

GOD IS NOT
THE PARENT
OF EVILS

ST. AUGUSTINE OF HIPPO (354–430 CE)

IN CONTEXT
BRANCH
Ethics

Humans are
rational beings.

APPROACH
Christian Platonism
BEFORE
c.400 BCE In Gorgias, Plato
argues that evil is not a thing,
but an absence of something.

In order to be
rational, humans must
have free will.

3rd century CE Plotinus
revives Plato’s view of
good and evil.
AFTER
c.520 Boethius uses an
Augustinian theory of evil in
The Consolation of Philosophy.

This means they must
be able to choose
between good or evil.

c.1130 Pierre Abelard rejects
the idea that there are not
evil things.
1525 Martin Luther, the
German priest who inspired
the Protestant reformation,
publishes On the Bondage
of the Will, arguing that the
human will is not free.

Humans can therefore
act badly or well.

God is not the
parent of evils.

A

ugustine was especially
interested in the problem
of evil. If God is entirely
good and all-powerful, why is there
evil in the world? For Christians
such as Augustine, as well as for
adherents of Judaism and Islam, this
was, and remains, a central question.
This is because it makes an obvious
fact about the world—that it
contains evil—into an argument
against the existence of God.
Augustine is able to answer
one aspect of the problem quite
easily. He believes that although
God created everything that exists,
he did not create evil, because evil is
not a thing, but a lack or deﬁciency
of something. For example, the evil
suffered by a blind man is that he is
without sight; the evil in a thief is
that he lacks honesty. Augustine
borrowed this way of thinking from
Plato and his followers.

An essential freedom
But Augustine still needs to explain
why God should have created the
world in such a way as to allow
there to be these natural and moral
evils, or deﬁciencies. His answer
revolves around the idea that
humans are rational beings. He
argues that in order for God to

David Hume 148–53

■

Plotinus 331

■

create rational creatures, such as
human beings, he had to give them
freedom of will. Having freedom of
will means being able to choose,
including choosing between good
and evil. For this reason God had
to leave open the possibility that
the ﬁrst man, Adam, would choose
evil rather than good. According
to the Bible this is exactly what
happened, as Adam broke God’s
command not to eat fruit from the
Tree of Knowledge.
In fact, Augustine’s argument
holds even without referring to
the Bible. Rationality is the ability
to evaluate choices through the
process of reasoning. The process is
only possible where there is freedom
of choice, including the freedom to
choose to do wrong.
Augustine also suggests a third
solution to the problem, asking us
to see the world as a thing of beauty.
He says that although there is evil
in the universe, it contributes to an
overall good that is greater than it

Boethius 74–75

■

Pierre Abelard 333

■

could be without evil—just as
discords in music can make a
harmony more lovely, or dark patches
add to the beauty of a picture.

Explaining natural evils
Since Augustine’s time, most
Christian philosophers have tackled
the problem of evil using one of his
approaches, while their opponents,
such as David Hume, have pointed
to their weaknesses as arguments
against Christianity. Calling sickness,
for instance, an absence of health
seems to be just playing with words:
illness may be due to a deﬁciency of
something, but the suffering of the
sick person is real enough. And
how are natural evils, such as
earthquakes and plagues, explained?
Someone without a prior belief
in God might still argue that the
presence of evil in the world proves
that there is no all-powerful and
benevolent God. But for those who do
already believe in God, Augustine’s
arguments might hold the answer. ■

What made Adam
capable of obeying God’s
commands also made
him able to sin.
St. Augustine of Hippo

St. Augustine of Hippo
Aurelius Augustine was born
in 354 CE in Thagaste, a small
provincial town in North
Africa, to a Christian mother
and a pagan father. He was
educated to be a rhetorician,
and he went on to teach
rhetoric in his home town,
and at Carthage, Rome, and
Milan, where he occupied
a prestigious position.
For a while Augustine
followed Manichaeism—a
religion that sees good and
evil as dual forces that rule
the universe—but under the
inﬂuence of Archbishop
Ambrose of Milan, he became
attracted to Christianity.
In 386, he suffered a spiritual
crisis and underwent a
conversion. He abandoned his
career and devoted himself to
writing Christian works, many
of a highly philosophical
nature. In 395 he became
Bishop of Hippo, in North
Africa, and he held this post
for the rest of his life. He died
in Hippo, aged 75, when the
town was beseiged and
sacked by the Vandals.
Key works

A world without evil, Augustine says,
would be a world without us—rational
beings able to choose their actions.
Just as for Adam and Eve, our moral
choices allow for the possibility of evil.

T

he Roman philosopher
Boethius was trained in
the Platonist tradition of
philosophy, and was also a Christian.
He is famous for his solution to a
problem that predates Aristotle:
if God already knows what we are
going to do in the future, how can
we be said to have free will?
The best way to understand the
dilemma is to imagine a situation in
everyday life. For instance, this

afternoon I might go to the cinema,
or I might spend time writing. As it
turns out, I go to the cinema. That
being the case, it is true now (before
the event) that I will go the cinema
this afternoon. But if it is true now,
then it seems that I do not really have
the choice of spending the afternoon
writing. Aristotle was the ﬁrst to
deﬁne this problem, but his answer
to it is not very clear; he seems to
have thought that a sentence such

as “I shall go to the cinema this
afternoon” is neither true nor false,
or at least not in the same way as
“I went to the cinema yesterday.”

A God beyond time
Boethius faced a harder version
of the same problem. He believed
that God knows everything; not only
the past and the present, but also
the future. So if I am going to go
to the cinema this afternoon, God
knows it now. It seems, therefore,
that I am not really free to choose

that would conﬂict with what God
already knows.
Boethius solves the problem by
arguing that the same thing can be
known in different ways, depending
on the nature of the knower. My dog,
for instance, knows the sun only as
something with qualities he can
sense—by sight and touch. A person,
however, can also reason about the
category of thing the sun is, and
may know which elements it is made
of, its distance from Earth, and so on.
Boethius considers time in a
similar kind of way. As we live in
the ﬂow of time, we can only know
events as past (if they have occurred),
present (if they are happening now),
or future (if they will come to pass).
We cannot know the outcome of
uncertain future events. God, by
contrast, is not in the ﬂow of time.
He lives in an eternal present, and
knows what to us are past, present,
and future in the same way that we
know the present. And just as my

some doctrines, such as the idea
that the universe has always existed,
Avicenna kept to the Aristotelian
view despite the fact that it clashed
with Islamic orthodoxy, but in other
areas he felt free to depart radically
from Aristotle. One striking example
is his explanation of the relationship
between mind (self or soul) and body.

Mind and body are distinct
Aristotle claims that the body and
mind of humans (and other animals)
are not two different things (or
“substances”), but one unit, and that
the mind is the “form” of the human
body. As such, it is responsible for
all the activities a human being can
perform, including thinking. For this

reason Aristotle does not seem to
think it possible for anything to
survive the death of the body.
By contrast, Avicenna is one of
the most famous “dualists” in the
history of philosophy—he thinks
that the body and the mind are two
distinct substances. His great
predecessor in this view was Plato,
who thought of the mind as a
distinct thing that was imprisoned
in the body. Plato believed that at
the point of death, the mind would
be released from its prison, to be
later reincarnated in another body.
In seeking to prove the divided
nature of mind and body, Avicenna
devised a thought-experiment
known as the “Flying Man”. This ❯❯

Ibn Sînâ, or Avicenna as the
Europeans called him, was
born in 980 in a village near
Bukhara, now in Uzbekhistan.
Although he wrote mainly in
Arabic, the language of
learning throughout the
Islamic world, he was a native
Persian speaker. Avicenna
was a child prodigy, rapidly
surpassing his teachers not
only in logic and philosophy,
but also in medicine. While
still in his teens, he became
known to the Samanid ruler
Nuh ibn Mansur as a brilliant
physician, and was given the
use of his magniﬁcent library.
Avicenna’s life was spent
in the service of various
princes, both as physician and
political adviser. He started
writing at the age of 21, and
went on to write more than
200 texts, on subjects as
diverse as metaphysics,
animal physiology, mechanics
of solids, and Arabic syntax.
He died when his medications
for colic were altered, possibly
maliciously, while on campaign
with his patron Alâ al-Dawla.

78 AVICENNA
appears as a treatise, On the Soul,
within his Book of Healing, and it
aims to strip away any knowledge
that can possibly be disproved, and
leave us only with absolute truths.
It remarkably anticipates the much
later work of Descartes, the famous
dualist of the 17th century, who also
decided to believe nothing at all
except that which he himself could
know for certain. Both Avicenna
and Descartes want to demonstrate
that the mind or self exists because
it knows it exists; and that it is
distinct from the human body.

The Flying Man
In the Flying Man experiment,
Avicenna wants to examine what
we can know if we are effectively
robbed of our senses, and cannot
depend on them for information.
He asks us each to imagine this:
suppose I have just come into
existence, but I have all my normal
intelligence. Suppose, too, that I am
blindfolded and that I am ﬂoating in
the air, and my limbs are separated

from each other, so I can touch
nothing. Suppose I am entirely
without any sensations. None the
less, I will be sure that I myself exist.
But what is this self, which is me?
It cannot be any of the parts of my
body, because I do not know that I
have any. The self that I afﬁrm as
existing does not have length or
breadth or depth. It has no extension,
or physicality. And, if I were able
to imagine, for instance, a hand,
I would not think that it belonged
to this self which I know exists.
It follows from this that the
human self—what I am—is distinct
from my body, or anything physical.
The Flying Man experiment, says
Avicenna, is a way of alerting and
reminding oneself of the existence
of the mind as something other
than, and distinct from, the body.
Avicenna also has other ways
to show that the mind cannot be
something material. Most are
based on the fact that the type of
intellectual knowledge the mind
can grasp cannot not be contained

The secret conversation
is a direct encounter
between God and the soul,
abstracted from all
material constraints.

by anything material. It is easy to
see how the parts of physical, shaped
things ﬁt with the parts of a physical,
shaped sense organ: the image of
the wall that I see is stretched over
the lens of my eye, each of its parts
corresponding to a part of the lens.
But the mind is not a sense organ;
what it grasps are deﬁnitions, such
as “Man is a rational, mortal animal”.
The parts of this phrase need to be
grasped at once, together. The mind
therefore cannot be in any way like
or part of the body.

The immortal soul
Avicenna goes on to draw the
conclusion that the mind is not
destroyed when the body dies, and
that it is immortal. This did not
help to make his thinking more
palatable to orthodox Muslims, who
believe that the whole person, body
and mind, is resurrected and enjoys
the afterlife. Consequently, Avicenna
was attacked in the 12th century
by the great Islamic theologian
al-Ghazâlî, who called him a heretic
Avicenna’s medical knowledge
was so vast that it won him royal
patronage. His Canon of Medicine

thing that he cannot be deceived
about, he realizes, is that he exists.
This self is exactly the self which
Avicenna’s Flying Man is sure of,
when he has no other knowledge.
Like Avicenna, Descartes can then
conclude that the “I”, or self, is
completely distinct from the body,
and that it must be immortal.

The ghost in the machine

for abandoning the central Islamic
tenet of the resurrection of the dead.
But in the same century Avicenna’s
work was also translated into Latin,
and his dualism became popular
among Christian philosophers and
theologians. They liked the way his
interpretations of Aristotle’s texts
made them easily compatible with
the idea of an immortal soul.

The indubitable self
Some 200 years later, in the 1250s,
Thomas Aquinas championed a
more faithful interpretation of
Aristotle, in which the mind and
body are much more closely tied
together, and his views were widely
accepted by the theologians of the
16th and 17th centuries. But in 1640
Descartes returned to a dualism
that was nearer to Plato’s than
Aristotle’s, and his argument for
it was very like Avicenna’s.
Descartes imagines that there
is a demon who is trying to deceive
him about everything on which he
might possibly be deceived. The one
Philip Pullman’s tale, Northern Lights,
picks up on the ancient Greek idea of a
person’s soul, or daimon, being separate
to the body, by presenting it as an
entirely separate animal, such as a cat.

One very strong objection to the
dualism of Avicenna or Descartes
is the argument used by Aquinas.
He says that the self which thinks
is the same as the self which feels
sensations in the body. For instance,
I do not just observe that there is
a pain in my leg, in the way that a
sailor might notice a hole in his ship.
The pain belongs to me as much as
my thoughts about philosophy, or
what I might have for lunch.
Most contemporary philosophers
reject mind-body dualism, largely
because of the increasing scientiﬁc
knowledge of the brain. Avicenna
and Descartes were both very
interested in physiology and they
produced scientiﬁc accounts of
activities such as movement and
sensation. But the process of
rational thinking was inexplicable
with the scientiﬁc tools of their

times. We are now able to explain
quite precisely how thinking goes
on in different areas of the brain—
though whether this means that we
can explain thinking without
reference to a self is not so clear.
An inﬂuential 20th-century British
philosopher, Gilbert Ryle, caricatured
the dualists’ self as “a ghost in the
machine”, and tried to show that
we can explain how human beings
perceive and function within the
world without resorting to this
“ghost” of a self.
Today philosophers are divided
between a small number of dualists,
a larger number of thinkers who say
that the mind is simply a brain, and
the majority, who agree that thinking
is the result of the physical activity
of the brain, but still insist there is
a distinction between the physical
states of the brain (the gray matter,
the neurons, and so on), and the
thinking which derives from them.
Many philosophers, especially
continental European thinkers, still
accept the results of Avicenna’s
thought experiment in one central
way. It shows, they say, that we each
have a self with a ﬁrst-person view
of the world (the “I”) that cannot be

A

lthough Christian thinkers
believe as a matter of faith
that God exists, in the
Middle Ages they were keen to
show that God’s existence could
also be proved by rational argument.
The Ontological Argument invented
by Anselm—an 11th-century Italian
philosopher who worked on the
basis of Aristotelian logic, Platonic
thinking, and his own genius—is
probably the most famous of all.
Anselm imagines himself
arguing with a Fool, who denies
that God exists (see opposite). The
argument rests on an acceptance
of two things: ﬁrst, that God is
“that than which nothing greater

We believe that
You [God] are that
than which nothing
greater can be thought.
St. Anselm

can be thought”, and second,
that existence is superior to
non-existence. By the end of the
argument the Fool is forced to
either take up a self-contradictory
position or admit that God exists.
The argument has been accepted
by many great philosophers, such as
René Descartes and Baruch Spinoza.
But there have been many others
who took up the Fool’s side. One
contemporary of Anselm’s, Gaunilo
of Marmoutiers, said that we could
use the same argument to prove that
there exists somewhere a marvellous
island, greater than any island that
can be thought. In the 18th century
Immanuel Kant objected that the
argument treats existence as if it
were an attribute of things—as if I
might describe my jacket like this:
“it’s green, made of tweed, and it
exists.” Existing is not like being
green: if it did not exist, there would
be no jacket to be green or tweed.
Kant holds that Anselm is also
wrong to say that what exists in
reality as well as in the mind is
greater than what exists in the
mind alone, but other philosophers
disagree. Is there not a sense in
which a real painting is greater
than the mental concept the painter
has before he starts work? ■

The Fool

Do you agree that if
God existed he would be the
greatest thing that there could be—
“that than which nothing greater
can be thought?”
Yes.

St. Anselm
And do you agree that “that
than which nothing greater can be
thought” exists in your mind?
Yes, in my mind—
but not in reality.
But would you agree
that something that exists in
reality as well as in the mind is
greater than something that
exists in the mind alone?

Yes, I suppose so—
an ice cream in my
hand is better than
one that’s just in
my imagination.

So if “that than which
nothing greater can be thought”
exists only in the mind, it is less great
than if it existed also in reality.
That’s true.
The being that
really exists would
be greater.
So now you are saying
that there is something greater
than “that than which nothing
greater exists?”
That doesn’t
even make sense.
Exactly. And the only
way around this contradiction
is to admit that God (“that than which
nothing greater exists”) does exist—
both in thought and reality.

Anselm’s Ontological
Argument was written
in 1077–78, but acquired
its title from the German
philosopher Kant in 1781.

St. Anselm of Canterbury was
born in Aosta in Italy in 1033.
He left home in his twenties to
study at the monastery of Bec,
in France, under an eminent
logician, grammarian, and
Biblical commentator named
Lanfranc. Anselm became a
monk of Bec in 1060, then
prior, and eventually abbot in
1078. He traveled to England,
and in 1093 was made
Archbishop of Canterbury,
despite his protestations of
ill-health and lack of political
skills. This position put him in
conﬂict with the Anglo-Norman
kings William II and Henry I,
as he tried to uphold the
Church against royal power.
These disputes led to two
periods of exile from England
for Anselm, during which he
visited the pope to plead the
case for the English Church
and his own removal from
ofﬁce. Ultimately reconciled
with King Henry I, Anselm
died in Canterbury aged 76.

the strictest Islamic regimes in the
Middle Ages. Yet he spent his nights
writing commentaries on the work
of an ancient pagan philosopher,
Aristotle—and one of Averroes’ avid
readers was none other than the
Almohad ruler, Abû Yacqûb Yûsuf.
Averroes reconciles religion and
philosophy through a hierarchical
theory of society. He thinks that
only the educated elite are capable
of thinking philosophically, and

everyone else should be obliged to
accept the teaching of the Qur’an
literally. Averroes does not think
that the Qur’an provides a completely
accurate account of the universe if
read in this literal way, but says that
it is a poetic approximation of the
truth, and this is the most that the
uneducated can grasp.
However, Averroes believes that
educated people have a religious
obligation to use philosophical
reasoning. Whenever reasoning
shows the literal meaning of the
Qur’an to be false, Averroes says
that the text must be “interpreted”;

to contradict this view. However, the
resurrection of the dead, a basic
tenet of Islam, is harder to include
within an Aristotelian universe.
Averroes accepts that we must
believe in personal immortality,
and that anyone who denies this is
a heretic who should be executed.
But he takes a different position
from his predecessors by saying that
Aristotle’s treatise On the Soul does
not state that individual humans
have immortal souls. According to
Averroes’ interpretation, Aristotle
claims that humanity is immortal
only through a shared intellect.
Averroes seems to be saying that

scholars such as Anicius Boethius

Averroists acccepted Aristotle as
interpreted by Averroes as the truth
according to reason—despite also
afﬁrming an apparently conﬂicting
set of Christian “truths.” They have
been described as advocating a
“double truth” theory, but their view
is rather that truth is relative to the
context of enquiry. ■

Later Averroists
Averroes’ advocacy of Aristotelian
philosophy (if only for the elite) was
shunned by his fellow Muslims. But
his works, translated into Hebrew
and Latin, had enormous inﬂuence
in the 13th and 14th centuries.
Scholars who supported the opinions
Ibn Rushd, known in Europe as
Averroes, was born in 1126 in
Cordoba, then part of Islamic
Spain. He belonged to a family of
distinguished lawyers and trained
in law, science, and philosophy.
His friendship with another doctor
and philosopher, Ibn Tufayl, led
to an introduction to the Caliph
Abû Yacqûb Yûsuf, who appointed
Averroes chief judge and later
court physician. Abû Yacqûb
also shared Averroes’ interest in
Aristotle, and commissioned him
to write a series of paraphrases of
all Aristotle’s works, designed for
non-specialists such as himself.

Some Muslims did not view philosophy
as a legitimate subject for study in the
12th century, but Averroes argued that
it was essential to engage with religion
critically and philosophically.

Despite the increasingly liberal
views of the Almohads, the
public disapproved of Averroes’
unorthodox philosophy, and
public pressure led to a banning
of his books and personal exile in
1195. Reprieved two years later,
Averroes returned to Cordoba
but died the following year.

negative theology, which
states that God is not being,
but more than being.

M

aimonides wrote on both
Jewish law (in Hebrew)
and Aristotelian thought
(in Arabic). In both areas, one of his
central concerns was to guard
against anthropomorphizing God,
which is the tendency to think
about God in the same way as a
human being. For Maimonides, the
worst mistake of all is to take the
Torah (the ﬁrst part of the Hebrew
Bible) as literal truth, and to think
that God is a bodily thing. Anyone

who thinks this, he says, should
be excluded from the Jewish
community. But in the Guide of the
Perplexed, Maimonides pushes this
idea to its farthest extent, developing
a strand of thought known as
“negative theology.” This already
existed in Christian theology, and
it focuses on describing God only
in terms of what God is not.
God, Maimonides says, has no
attributes. We cannot rightly say
that God is “good” or “powerful.”

Attributes are either…

…accidental.

…essential.

But God has
no accidents.

Essential attributes

God has

But God

This is because an attribute is
either accidental (capable of change)
or essential. One of my accidental
attributes, for example, is that I am
sitting; others are that I have gray
hair and a long nose. But I would
still be what I essentially am even if
I were standing, red-haired, and had
a snub-nose. Being human—that is,
being a rational, mortal animal—is
my essential attribute: it deﬁnes
me. God, it is generally agreed, has
no accidental attributes, because
God is unchanging. In addition,
says Maimonides, God cannot have
any essential attributes either,
because they would be deﬁning,
and God cannot be deﬁned. So God
has no attributes at all.

Speaking about God
Maimondes claims that we can say
things about God, but they must be
understood as telling us about God’s
actions, rather than God’s being.
Most discussions in the Torah should
be understood in this way. So when

■

When the intellects

Maimonides

we are told that “God is a creator”,
we must understand this as stating
what God does, rather than the
sort of thing God is. If we were to
consider the sentence “John is a
writer”, we might normally take it
to mean that being a writer is John’s
profession. But Maimonides asks us
to consider only what has been
done: in this instance John has
written words. The writing has been
brought about by John but it does
not tell us anything about him.
Maimonides also accepts that
statements which seem to attribute
qualities to God can be understood
if they are taken as double negatives.
“God is powerful”: should be taken
to mean that God is not powerless.
Imagine a game in which I think of
a thing and tell you what it is not
(it is not large, it is not red...) until
you guess what it is. The difference
in the case of God is that we have
only the negations to guide us: we
cannot say what God is. ■
The Mishneh Torah was a complete
restatement of Jewish Oral Law, which
Maimonides wrote in plain Hebrew so
that “young and old” could know and
understand all the Jewish observances.

Moses Maimonides
Moses Maimonides (also
known as Rambam) was born
in 1135 in Cordoba, Spain, into
a Jewish family. His childhood
was rich in cross-cultural
inﬂuences: he was educated
in both Hebrew and Arabic,
and his father, a rabbinic
judge, taught him Jewish law
within the context of Islamic
Spain. His family ﬂed Spain
when the Berber Almohad
dynasty came to power in
1148, and lived nomadically
for 10 years until they settled
ﬁrst in Fez (now in Morocco)
and then Cairo. The family’s
ﬁnancial problems led
Maimonides to train as a
physician, and his skill led to
a royal appointment within
only a few years. He also
worked as a rabbinic judge,
but this was an activity for
which he thought it wrong
to accept any payment. He
was recognized as head of
the Jewish community of
Cairo in 1191, and after his
death his tomb became a
place of Jewish pilgrimage.

on dhikr—ritual prayer or litany—

Central to his visionary philosophy
is the idea that the universe and
everything in it is an endless ﬂow
of life, in which God is an eternal

explain our place within it.
Man, he believes, is a link
between the past and future in a
continual process of life, death, and
rebirth—not as a cycle, but in a
progression from one form to another
stretching into eternity. Death and
decay are inevitable and part of

hold that it has always existed.
Today we tend to look to physics
and astronomy for an answer, but
in the past this was a question for
philosophers and theologians. The
answer given by the Catholic priest
and philosopher Thomas Aquinas,
the most famous of all medieval
Christian philosophers, is especially
interesting. It is still a plausible
way of thinking about the problem,
and it also tells us a great deal about
how Aquinas combined his faith
with his philosophical reasoning,
despite their apparent contradictions.

Aristotle’s inﬂuence
The central ﬁgure in Aquinas’s
thinking is Aristotle, the ancient
Greek philosopher whose work was
intensively studied by medieval
thinkers. Aristotle was certain that
the universe has always existed,
and that it has always been home
to different things, from inanimate
objects like rocks, to living species,
such as humans, dogs, and horses.
He argued that the universe is
changing and moving, and this
Thomas Aquinas was born in
1225 at Roccasecca in Italy. He
studied at the University of
Naples and then joined the
Dominican order (a new, highly
intellectual order of friars) against
the wishes of his family. As a
novitiate he studied in Paris and
then in Cologne under the German
Aristotelian theologian, Albert
the Great. Returning to Paris, he
became Master (professor) of
theology, before leaving to travel
around Italy teaching for 10 years.
Unusually, Aquinas was then
offered a second period of tenure
as Master at Paris. In 1273 he

can only be caused by change and
motion. So there could never have
been a ﬁrst change or motion: the
universe must have been moving
and changing for ever.
The great Arabic philosophers,
Avicenna and Averroes, were
willing to accept Aristotle’s view,
even though it put them at odds
with Islamic orthodoxy. Medieval
Jewish and Christian thinkers,
however, struggled to do so. They
held that, according to the Bible,
the universe has a beginning, so
Aristotle must be wrong: the
universe has not always existed.
But was this view something that
had to be accepted on faith, or
could it be refuted by reasoning?
John Philoponus, a Greek
Christian writer of the 6th century,
believed that he had found an
argument to show that Aristotle
must be wrong, and that the
universe had not always existed.
His reasoning was copied and
developed by a number of thinkers
in the 13th century, who needed to
ﬁnd a ﬂaw in Aristotle’s reasoning
in order to protect the teachings of
the Church. Their line of argument
was especially clever, because it
took Aristotle’s own ideas about
experienced something that
has been considered both some
sort of vision and a possible
stroke; after it, he said that all
he had done was “mere straw”,
and he never wrote again. He
died at the age of 49, and was
recognized as a saint by the
Catholic Church in 1323.

and Plato in The Triumph of Thomas
Aquinas. His understanding of ancient
philosophy was considered greater than
that of Averroes, who lies at his feet.

inﬁnity as a point of departure, but
turned them against his view of
the universe as eternal.

An inﬁnity of humans
According to Aristotle, the inﬁnite
is what has no limit. For instance,
the sequence of numbers is inﬁnite,
because for each number, there is
another higher number that follows.
Similarly, the universe has existed
for an inﬁnite time, because for each
day, there is a preceding day. In
Aristotle’s opinion, however, this is
a “potential” inﬁnity, as these days
do not coexist at the same time;
an “actual” inﬁnity—in which an
inﬁnite number of things all exist
at the same time—is impossible.
Philoponus and his 13th-century
followers, however, think that this
argument presents problems that
Aristotle had not noticed. They point
to the fact that he believes that all

the types of living beings in the
universe have always existed. If this
were true, they say, it would mean
that there were already an inﬁnite
number of human beings by the
time Socrates was born—because
if they have always existed, they
existed then. But since Socrates’
time, many more humans have been
born, and so the number of humans
born up until now must be greater
than inﬁnity. But no number can
be greater than inﬁnity.
In addition, these writers add,
Christian thinkers believe that
human souls are immortal. If this
is so, and an inﬁnite number of
humans has already existed, there
must be an inﬁnite number of human
souls in existence now. So there is
an actual inﬁnity of souls, not a
potential inﬁnity; and Aristotle has
said actual inﬁnity is impossible.
With these two arguments,
using Aristotle’s own principles as
a starting point, Philoponus and his
followers were conﬁdent they had
demonstrated that the universe
cannot always have existed.

Aristotle was therefore wrong; the
universe is not eternal, and this ﬁts
perfectly with the Christian
doctrine that God created the world.
Aquinas has little time for this
line of reasoning. He points out that
the universe could have existed for
ever but that species such as
humans and other animals might
have had a beginning, and so the

beginning—but he also wants
to show that there is no ﬂaw in
Aristotle’s reasoning. He claims
that his Christian contemporaries
have confused two different points:
the ﬁrst is that God created the
universe, and the second is that the
universe had a beginning. Aquinas
set out to prove that in fact

universe has always existed—

that God created the universe.

he doesn’t think that Aristotle’s
position is illogical. Like Philoponus

Aquinas steps away from Philoponus
and his followers by insisting that
although it is true, as the Bible says,
that the universe had a beginning,
this is not a necessary (undeniable)
truth on logical grounds. As they all
agree, God created the universe
with a beginning, but he could just

as easily have created an eternal
one. If something is created by God,
then it owes its whole existence to
God, but that does not mean that
there must have been a time when
it did not exist at all. It is therefore
quite possible to believe in an
eternal universe that had been
created by God.
Aquinas gives an example of
how this might work. Suppose
there was a foot making a footprint
in the sand and it had been there
for ever. Although there would
never have been a moment before
the footprint was made, we would
still recognize the foot as the cause
of the footprint: if it were not for the
foot, there would not be a footprint.

Aquinas and synthesis
Historians sometimes say that
Aquinas “synthesized” Christianity
and Aristotelian philosophy, as if
he took the parts he wanted from
each and made them into a smooth
mixture. In fact, for Aquinas—as
for most Christians—the teachings
of the Church must all be accepted,
without exception or compromise.
Aquinas was unusual, however,
because he thought that, properly
understood, Aristotle did not
contradict Christian teaching. The
question of whether the universe
always existed is the exception
that proves the rule. In this
particular case Aquinas thinks
that Aristotle was wrong, but he
was not wrong in principle, or in
his reasoning. The universe really
might have existed for ever, as far
as the ancient philosophers knew.
It was just that Aristotle, not having
access to Christian revelation, had
Aquinas believed the creation story
on faith, but claimed that some elements
of Christian belief could be rationally
demonstrated. For Aquinas, the Bible
and reason need never conﬂict.

THE MEDIEVAL WORLD 93
Aristotle believed that the universe was inﬁnite,
as each hour and day is succeed by another. Aquinas
disagreed, believing that the universe had a beginning,
but his respect for Aristotle’s philosophy led him to
argue that Aristotle could have been correct.

no way of knowing that it had not.
Aquinas believes that there are
a number of other doctrines central
to Christianity that the ancient
philosophers did not know and
could not have known—such as
the belief that God is a Trinity
made up of three persons, and that
one person of the Trinity, the Son,
became a human. But in Aquinas’s
opinion, whenever humans reason
correctly, they cannot come to any
conclusion which contradicts
Christian doctrine. This is because
both human reason and Christian
teaching come from the same
source—God—and so they can
never contradict each other.
Aquinas taught in convents
and universities in France and Italy,
and the idea that human reason
could never conﬂict with Christian
doctrine often placed him in ﬁerce
conﬂict with some of his academic
contemporaries, especially those
who specialized in the sciences,
which at the time were derived
from the work of Aristotle. Aquinas
accused his fellow scholars of
accepting certain positions on
faith—for example, the position
that we each have an immortal

soul—but of saying at the same
time that according to reason,
these positions could be shown
to be wrong.

How we gain knowledge
Aquinas keeps to these principles
throughout his work, but they are
particularly clear in two central
areas of his thought: his account
of how we gain knowledge and his
treatment of the relation between
mind and body. According to
Aquinas, human beings acquire
knowledge through using their
senses: sight, hearing, smell, touch,
and taste. These sense-impressions,
however, only tell us what things
are like superﬁcially. For example,
from where John sits, he has a visual
impression of a tree-shaped object,
which is green and brown. I, on the
other hand, am standing next to the
tree, and can feel the roughness of
its bark and smell the scent of the
forest. If John and I were dogs, our
knowledge of the tree would be
limited to these sense-impressions.
But as human beings we are able to
go beyond them and grasp what a
tree is in a rational way, deﬁning it
and distinguishing it from other

types of plants and of living things.
Aquinas calls this “intellectual
knowledge”, because we gain it
by using the innate power of our
intellect to seize, on the basis of
sense-impressions, the reality that
lies behind them. Animals other
than humans lack this inborn
capacity, which is why their
knowledge cannot stretch beyond
the senses. All of our scientiﬁc
understanding of the world is based
on this intellectual knowledge.
Aquinas’s theory of knowledge
owes much to Aristotle, although
he clariﬁes and elaborates upon ❯❯

We should see whether
there is a contradiction
between something being
created by God, and its
existing forever.
Thomas Aquinas

94 THOMAS AQUINAS
the latter’s thinking. For Aquinas, as
a Christian thinker, human beings
are only one type of the various
sorts of beings that are capable of
knowing things intellectually: souls
separated from their bodies in the
afterlife, angels, and God himself
can also do this. These other
knowing beings do not have
to acquire knowledge through the
senses. They can directly grasp
the deﬁnitions of things. This
aspect of Aquinas’s theory has
no parallel in Aristotle, but it is a
coherent development of Aristotle’s
principles. Once again Aquinas
is able to hold Christian beliefs
without contradicting Aristotle,
but going beyond him.

The human soul
According to Aristotle, the intellect
is the life-principle or “soul” of a
human being. All living things have
a soul, he believes, which explains
their capacity for different levels of

what he calls “life-activity”, such
as growing and reproducing, for
plants; moving, sensing, seeking,
and avoiding, for animals; and
thinking for humans.
Aristotle believes that “form” is
what makes matter into the thing
that it is. Within the human body,
this form is the soul, which makes
the body into the living thing that
it is by giving it a particular set of
life-activities. As such, the soul is
tied to the body, and so Aristotle
thinks that, even in the case of
humans, the life-soul survives only
so long as it animates a body, and
at death it perishes.
Aquinas follows Aristotle’s
teaching about living things and
their souls, and he insists that a
human being has just one form:
his or her intellect. Although other
13th- and 14th-century thinkers
also adopted the main lines of
Aristotle’s view, they cut the
connection Aristotle had made

The laws of cause and effect lead us to look for the
cause of any event, even the beginning of the universe.

motion, and Aquinas agreed, but added that the
“Prime Mover”—God—must itself be uncaused.

?

between the intellect and the body,
so they could accommodate the
Christian teaching that the human
soul survives death. Aquinas,
however, refuses to distort
Aristotle’s position. This made it
far more difﬁcult for him to argue—
as he did—for the immortality of
the human soul, in yet another
example of his resolve to be a good
Aristotelian, and philosopher, while
remaining a faithful Christian.

After Aquinas
Since the Middle Ages, Aquinas
has come to be regarded as the
ofﬁcial orthodox philosopher of
the Catholic Church. In his own
time, when translations of Greek
philosophy were being made from
Arabic, complete with Arabic
commentaries, he was one of the
thinkers keenest to follow Aristotle’s
train of philosophical reasoning,
even when it did not ﬁt neatly with
Christian doctrine. He always

caused this newton’s cradle
to swing. But does the
existence of the universe
itself have a cause?

remained faithful to the Church’s
teachings, but this did not prevent
his thought from almost being
condemned as heretical shortly
after his death. The great thinkers
and teachers of the following
century, such as the secular
philosopher Henry of Ghent, and
the Franciscans John Duns Scotus
and William of Ockham, were all
far more willing to say that purely
philosophical reasoning, as best
represented by Aristotle’s
arguments, is often mistaken.
Scotus thought that Aquinas’s
Aristotelian view of the soul was
inadequate, and Ockham rejected
Aristotle’s account of knowledge
almost entirely. Henry of Ghent
explicitly criticized Aquinas’s view
that God could have created a
universe that always exists. If it
always existed, he argued, there
would be no possibility of its not
existing, and so God would not
have been free to create or not
create it. Aquinas’s supreme
conﬁdence in the power of reason
meant that he had more in common
with the greatest philosopher of
the previous century, the French
philosopher and theologian Pierre
Abélard, than he did with his
contemporaries and successors.

Coherent belief
Both Aquinas’s general view on
the relation between philosophy
and Christian doctrine, and his
particular treatment of the eternity
of the universe, remain relevant
in the 21st century. Today few
philosophers believe that religious
positions, such as the existence of
God or the immortality of the soul,

can be proved by philosophical
reasoning. But what some claim for
philosophy is that it can demonstrate
that although religious believers
hold certain doctrines as a matter
of faith, their overall views are no
less rational or coherent than those
of agnostics or atheists. This view
is an extension and development of
Aquinas’s constant endeavor to
develop a philosophically coherent
system of thought, while holding
on to his Christian beliefs. Reading
Aquinas’s works is a lesson in
tolerance, for Christians and
non-Christians alike.

science for an explanation of how
the universe began, the arguments
of Aquinas show that philosophy is
still relevant to how we think about
the subject. He demonstrates how
philosophy can provide the tools for
intelligent enquiry, allowing us to
investigate not what happens to be
the case, but what is possible and
what is impossible, and what are
intelligible questions to ask. Is it or
is it not coherent to believe that the
universe had a beginning? This is
still a question for philosophers, and
no amount of theoretical physics
will be able to answer it. ■

The role of philosophy
Today, we do not look to philosophy
to tell us whether or not the universe
has always existed, and most of us
do not turn to the Bible, as Aquinas
and other medieval philosophers
did. Instead we look to physics,
in particular to the theory of the
“Big Bang” proposed by modern
scientists, including the British
physicist and cosmologist Stephen
Hawking. This theory states that
the universe expanded from a state
of extremely high temperature and
density at a particular point in time.
Though most of us now turn to

N

ikolaus von Kues belongs
to a long tradition of
medieval philosophers
who attempt to describe the nature
of God, stressing how God is unlike
anything that the human mind is
capable of grasping. Von Kues
begins with the idea that we gain
knowledge by using our reason to
deﬁne things. So in order to know
God, he deduces that we must try
to deﬁne the basic nature of God.
Plato describes “the Good” or
“the One” as the ultimate source of
all other forms and knowledge, and

some early Christian theologians
talk of God as “above being.” Von
Kues, writing around 1440, goes
further, stating that God is what
comes before everything, even
before the possibility of something
existing. Yet reason tells us the
possibility of any phenomenon
existing must come before its
actual existence. It is impossible
for something to come into being
before the possibility of it arises.
The conclusion that von Kues
comes to, therefore, is that
something that is said to do this
must be described as “Not-other.”

Beyond apprehension

Whatever-I-know
is not God and
whatever-I-conceive
is not like God.
Nikolaus von Kues

However, the use of the word
“thing” in the line of reasoning that
von Kues adopts is misleading, as
the “Not-other” has no substance.
It is, according to von Kues, “beyond
apprehension”, and is before all
things in such a way that “they
are not subsequent to it, but exist
through it.” For this reason too,
von Kues thinks “Not-other” comes
closer to a deﬁnition of God than
any other term. ■

he Renaissance—a cultural
“rebirth” of extraordinary
creativity in Europe—began
in 14th-century Florence. It was to
spread across Europe, lasting until
the 17th century, and it is now
viewed as the bridge between the
medieval and modern periods.
Marked by a renewed interest in the
whole of Greek and Latin Classical
culture—not just the philosophical
and mathematical texts assimilated
by medieval Scholasticism—it was
a movement that viewed humans,
not God, at its center. This new
humanism was reﬂected ﬁrst in the
art and then the political and social
structure of Italian society; republics
such as Florence and Venice soon
abandoned medieval feudalism
in favor of plutocracies where
commerce ﬂourished alongside
the new scientiﬁc discoveries.

By the end of the 15th century,
Renaissance ideas had spread
across Europe and virtually eclipsed
the Church’s monopoly of learning.
Although Christian philosophers
such as Erasmus and Thomas More
had contributed to the arguments
within the Church that had sparked
the Reformation, a purely secular
philosophy had yet to emerge.
Unsurprisingly, the ﬁrst truly
Renaissance philosopher was a
Florentine – Niccolò Machiavelli –
and his philosophy marked a
deﬁnitive movement from the
theological to the political.

The Age of Reason
The ﬁnal nail in the cofﬁn of the
Church’s authority came from
science. First Nicolaus Copernicus,
then Johannes Kepler, and ﬁnally
Galileo Galilei showed that the

Ptolemaic model of the universe
with Earth at its center was
mistaken, and their demonstrations
overturned centuries of Christian
teaching. The Church fought back,
ultimately imprisoning Galileo for
heresy, but advances in all the
sciences soon followed those in
astronomy, providing alternative
explanations for the workings of
the universe, and a basis for a new
kind of philosophy.
The victory of rational, scientiﬁc
discovery over Christian dogma
epitomized the thinking of the
17th century. British philosophers,
notably Francis Bacon and Thomas
Hobbes, took the lead in integrating
scientiﬁc and philosophical
reasoning. It was the beginning
of a period that became known as
the Age of Reason, which produced
the ﬁrst great “modern” philosophers

and revived the connection between
philosophy and science, especially
mathematics, that dated back to
pre-Socratic Greece.

The birth of rationalism
In the 17th century, many of the
most signiﬁcant philosophers in
Europe were also accomplished
mathematicians. In France, René
Descartes and Blaise Pascal made
major contributions to mathematics,
as did Gottfried Leibniz in Germany.
They believed that its reasoning
process provided the best model for
how to acquire all our knowledge of
the world. Descartes’s investigation
of the question “What can I know?”
led him to a position of rationalism,
which is the belief that knowledge
comes from reason alone. This
became the predominant belief in
continental Europe for the next

century. At the same time, a very
different philosophical tradition
was being established in Britain.
Following the scientiﬁc reasoning
espoused by Francis Bacon, John
Locke came to the conclusion that
our knowledge of the world comes
not from reason, but experience.
This view, known as empiricism,
characterized British philosophy
during the 17th and 18th centuries.
Despite the division between
continental rationalism and British
empiricism (the same division that
had separated the philosophies of
Plato and Aristotle), both had in
common the placing of the human
at their centers: it is this being
whose reason or experience leads
to knowledge. Philosophers on both
sides of the Channel had moved
from asking questions about the
nature of the universe—which were

being answered by scientists such
as Isaac Newton—to questioning
how we can know what we know,
and they now began to investigate
the nature of the human mind and
self. But these new philosophical
strands had moral and political
implications. Just as the Church’s
authority had been undermined by
the ideas of the Renaissance, so the
aristocracies and monarchies were
threatened by the new ideas of the
Enlightenment, as this period came
to be known. If the old rulers were
removed from power, what sort of
society was to replace them?
In Britain, Hobbes and Locke
had laid the foundations for
democratic thinking during the
turbulent 17th century, but it was
another 100 years before a
questioning of the status quo
began in earnest elsewhere. ■

n order fully to understand
Machiavelli’s views on power,
it is necessary to understand
the background to his political
concerns. Machiavelli was born in
Florence, Italy, during a time of
almost constant upheaval. The
Medici family had been in open but
unofﬁcial control of the city-state
for some 35 years, and the year of
Machiavelli’s birth saw Lorenzo de’
Medici (Lorenzo the Magniﬁcent)
succeed his father as ruler, ushering
in a period of great artistic activity
in Florence. Lorenzo was succeeded
in 1492 by his son Piero (known as

Piero the Unfortunate), whose
reign was short-lived. The French
under Charles VIII invaded Italy in
considerable force in 1494, and
Piero was forced to surrender and
then ﬂee the city, as the citizens
rebelled against him. Florence was
declared a republic that same year.
The Dominican prior of the
San Marco monastery, Girolamo
Savonarola, then came to dominate
Florentine political life. The citystate entered a democratic period
under his guidance, but after
accusing the pope of corruption
Savonarola was eventually arrested

and burnt as a heretic. This led
to Machiavelli’s ﬁrst known
involvement in Florentine politics,
and he became Secretary to the
second Chancery in 1498.

Career and inﬂuences
The invasion by Charles VIII in
1494 had sparked a turbulent period
in the history of Italy, which at the
time was divided into ﬁve powers:
the papacy, Naples, Venice, Milan,
and Florence. The country was
fought over by various foreign
powers, mainly France, Spain, and
the Holy Roman Empire. Florence

Lorenzo the Magniﬁcent (1449–1492)
effectively ruled Florence from the
death of his father in 1469 until his
death. Though he ruled as a despot, the
republic ﬂourished under his guidance.

Machiavelli was released from
prison within a month, but his
chances of re-employment were
slim, and his attempts to ﬁnd a new
political position came to nothing.
He decided to present the head of
the de’ Medici family in Florence,
Giuliano, with a book. By the time
it was ready Giuliano had died, so
Machiavelli changed the dedication
to Giuliano’s successor, Lorenzo.
The book was of a type popular at
the time: advice to a prince.

The Prince

was weak in the face of their armies,
and Machiavelli spent 14 years
travelling between various cities
on diplomatic missions, trying to
shore up the struggling republic.
In the course of his diplomatic
activities, Machiavelli met Cesare
Borgia, the illegitimate son of Pope
Alexander VI. The pope was a
powerful ﬁgure in northern Italy,
and a signiﬁcant threat to Florence.
Although Cesare was Florence’s
enemy, Machiavelli—despite his
republican views—was impressed
by his vigor, intelligence, and
ability. Here we see one of the
sources for Machiavelli’s famous
work, The Prince.
Pope Alexander VI died in 1503,
and his successor Pope Julius II
was another strong and successful

man who impressed Machiavelli
with both his military ability and
his cunning. But tension between
France and the papacy led to
Florence ﬁghting with the French
against the pope and his allies,
the Spanish. The French lost, and
Florence with them. In 1512 the
Spanish dissolved the city-state’s
government, the Medicis returned,
and what was in effect a tyranny
under Cardinal de’ Medici was
installed. Machiavelli was ﬁred
from his political ofﬁce and exiled
to his farm in Florence. His political
career might have revived under
the rule of the Medicis, but in
February 1513 he was falsely
implicated in a plot against the
family, and he was tortured,
ﬁned, and imprisoned.

Machiavelli’s book The Prince was
witty and cynical, and showed a
great understanding of Italy in
general and Florence in particular.
In it, Machiavelli sets out his
argument that the goals of a ruler
justify the means used to obtain
them. The Prince differed markedly
from other books of its type in its
resolute setting aside of Christian
morality. Machiavelli wanted to ❯❯

Niccolò Machiavelli

106 NICCOLO MACHIAVELLI
give ruthlessly practical advice to a
prince and, as his experience with
extremely successful popes and
cardinals had shown him, Christian
values should be cast aside if they
got in the way.
Machiavelli’s approach centers
on the notion of virtù, but this is not
the modern notion of moral virtue.
It shares more similarities with the
medieval notion of virtues as the
powers or functions of things, such
as the healing powers of plants or
minerals. Machiavelli is writing
about the virtues of princes, and
these were the powers and functions
that concerned rule. The Latin root
of virtù also relates it to manliness
(as in “virile”), and this feeds into
what Machiavelli has to say in
its application both to the prince
himself and to the state—where

sometimes virtù is used to mean
“success”, and describes a state
that is to be admired and imitated.
Part of Machiavelli’s point is
that a ruler cannot be bound by
morality, but must do what it takes
to secure his own glory and the
success of the state over which he
rules—an approach that became
known as realism. But Machiavelli
does not argue that the end justiﬁes
the means in all cases. There are
certain means that a wise prince
must avoid, for though they might
achieve the desired ends, they lay
him open to future dangers.
The main means to be avoided
consist of those that would make
the people hate their prince. They

Prince, and must imitate the qualities
of the fox as well as the lion.

hate him, for this is likely to lead
to rebellion. Also, a prince who
mistreats his people unnecessarily
will be despised—a prince should
have a reputation for compassion,
not for cruelty. This might involve
harsh punishment of a few in order
to achieve general social order,
which beneﬁts more people in
the long run.
In cases where Machiavelli
does think that the end justiﬁes
the means, this rule applies only
to princes. The proper conduct of
citizens of the state is not at all the
same as that of the prince. But even
for ordinary citizens, Machiavelli
generally disdains conventional
Christian morality as being weak
and unsuitable for a strong city.

There are reasons to suspect that
The Prince does not represent
Machiavelli’s own views. Perhaps
the most important is the disparity
between the ideas it contains and
those expressed in his other main
work, Discourses on the Ten Books
of Titus Livy. In the Discourses
Machiavelli argues that a republic
is the ideal regime, and that it

should be instituted whenever a
reasonable degree of equality
exists or can be established. A
princedom is only suitable when
equality does not exist in a state,
and cannot be introduced. However,
it can be argued that The Prince
represents Machiavelli’s genuine
ideas about how the ruler should
rule in such cases; if princedoms
are sometimes a necessary evil, it
is best that they be ruled as well as
possible. Moreover, Machiavelli did
believe that Florence was in such
political turmoil that it needed a
strong ruler to get it into shape.

Ruthlessness has been a virtue of
leadership throughout history. In the
20th century, the fascist dictator Benito
Mussolini used a mixture of fear and
love to hold on to power in Italy.

Pleasing the readers
The fact that The Prince was
written by Machiavelli in order to
ingratiate himself with the Medicis
is another reason to treat its
contents with caution. However, he
also dedicated the Discourses to
members of Florence’s republican
government. Machiavelli, it could
be argued, would have written
what the dedicatee wanted to read.
The Prince, however, contains
much that Machiavelli is thought to
have genuinely believed, such as
the need for a citizens’ militia
rather than reliance on mercenaries.

Niccolò Machiavelli

The problem lies in discerning
which parts are his actual beliefs
and which are not. It is tempting to
divide them according to how well
they ﬁt with the intended reader’s
own beliefs, but that is unlikely to
give an accurate result.
It has also been suggested that
Machiavelli was attempting satire,
and his real intended audience was
the republicans, not the ruling elite.
This idea is supported by the fact
that Machiavelli did not write it in

Latin, the language of the elite, but
in Italian, the language of the people.
Certainly, The Prince at times reads
satirically, as though the audience
is expected to conclude: “if that is
how a good prince should behave,
we should at all costs avoid being
ruled by one!” If Machiavelli was
also satirizing the idea that “the
end justiﬁes the means”, then the
purpose of this small, deceptively
simple book is far more intriguing
than one might originally assume. ■

Machiavelli was born in Florence
in 1469. Little is known of the ﬁrst
28 years of his life; apart from a
few inconclusive mentions in his
father’s diary, the ﬁrst direct
evidence is a business letter
written in 1497. From his writings,
though, it is clear that he received
a good education, perhaps at the
University of Florence.
By 1498, Machiavelli had
become a politician and diplomat
of the Florentine Republic. After
his enforced retirement on the
return of the Medicis to Florence
in 1512, he devoted himself to
various literary activities, as well

as persistent attempts to return
to the political arena. Eventually
he regained the trust of the
Medicis, and Cardinal Giulio
de’ Medici commissioned him to
write a history of Florence. The
book was ﬁnished in 1525, after
the cardinal had become Pope
Clement VII. Machiavelli died
in 1527, without achieving his
ambition to return to public life.

Ethics

Tranquillity depends
upon detachment
from the opinion of others.

APPROACH
Humanism
BEFORE
4th century BCE Aristotle,
in his Nicomachean Ethics,
argues that to be virtuous, a
person must be sociable and
form close relationships with
others; only a bestial man or
a god can ﬂourish alone.
AFTER
Late 18th century Anglican
evangelical clergyman Richard
Cecil states, “Solitude shows
us what we should be; society
shows us what we are.”
Late 19th century Friedrich
Nietzsche describes solitude
as necessary to the task of
self-examination, which he
claims can alone free humans
from the temptation just to
thoughtlessly follow the mob.

If we seek fame—which
is glory in the eyes of
others—we must seek
their good opinion.

If we seek fame

I

n his essay “On Solitude”
(from the ﬁrst volume of his
Essays), Montaigne takes up a
theme that has been popular since
ancient times: the intellectual and
moral dangers of living among
others, and the value of solitude.
Montaigne is not stressing the
importance of physical solitude, but
rather of developing the ability to
resist the temptation to mindlessly
fall in with the opinion and actions
of the mob. He compares our desire
for the approval of our fellow humans
to being overly attached to material
wealth and possessions. Both
passions diminish us, Montaigne
claims, but he does not conclude
that we should relinquish either,
only that we should cultivate a
detachment from them. By doing so,
we may enjoy them—and even
beneﬁt from them—but we will not
become emotionally enslaved to
them, or devastated if we lose them.
“On Solitude” then considers
how our desire for mass approval
is linked to the pursuit of glory, or
fame. Contrary to thinkers such
as Niccolò Machiavelli, who see
glory as a worthy goal, Montaigne
believes that constant striving
for fame is the greatest barrier to
peace of mind, or tranquility. He

RENAISSANCE AND THE AGE OF REASON 109

Friedrich Nietzsche 214–21

says of those who present glory as a
desirable goal that they “only have
their arms and legs out of the
crowd; their souls, their wills, are
more engaged with it than ever.”
Montaigne is not concerned
with whether or not we achieve
glory. His point is that we should
shake off the desire for glory in the
eyes of other people—that we
should not always think of other
people’s approval and admiration
as being valuable. He goes on to
recommend that instead of looking
for the approbation of those around
us, we should imagine that some
truly great and noble being is
constantly with us, able to observe
our most private thoughts, a being
in whose presence even the mad
would hide their failings. By doing
this, we will learn to think clearly
and objectively and behave in a
more thoughtful and rational
manner. Montaigne claims that
caring too much about the opinion

of those around us will corrupt us,
either because we end up imitating
those who are evil, or become so
consumed by hatred for them that
we lose our reason.

Glory’s pitfalls
Montaigne returns to his attack
on the pursuit of glory in his later
writings, pointing out that the
acquisition of glory is often so
much a matter of mere chance
that it makes little sense to hold it
in such reverence. “Many times I’ve
seen [fortune] stepping out ahead
of merit, and often a long way
ahead,” he writes. He also points
out that encouraging statesmen
and political leaders to value glory
above all things, as Machiavelli
does, merely teaches them never
to attempt any endeavor unless
an approving audience is on hand,
ready and eager to bear witness to
the remarkable nature of their
powers and achievements. ■

than to see what is really there;
the “idols of the marketplace”, our
tendency to let social conventions
distort our experience; and the
“idols of the theater”, the distorting
inﬂuence of prevailing philosophical
and scientiﬁc dogma. The scientist,
according to Bacon, must battle
against all these handicaps to gain
knowledge of the world.

Scientiﬁc method
Science, not religion, was regarded
increasingly as the key to knowledge
from the 16th century onward. This 1598
print depicts the observatory of Danish
astronomer Tycho Brahe (1546–1601).

Luther’s new form of Christianity,
changed its stance and turned
against scientiﬁc endeavor. This
opposition, from both sides of the
religious divide, hampered the
development of the sciences.
Bacon claims to accept the
teachings of the Christian Church.
But he also argues that science
must be separated from religion,
in order to make the acquisition of
knowledge quicker and easier, so
that it can be used to improve the
quality of people’s lives. Bacon
stresses this transforming role for
science. One of his complaints is
that science’s ability to enhance
human existence had previously
been ignored, in favor of a focus on
academic and personal glory.
Bacon presents a list of the
psychological barriers to pursuing
scientiﬁc knowledge in terms that
he calls collectively the “idols of
the mind.” These are the “idols of
the tribe”, the tendency of human
beings as a species (or “tribe”) to
generalize; the “idols of the cave”,
the human tendency to impose

Bacon goes on to argue that the
advancement of science depends on
formulating laws of ever-increasing
generality. He proposes a scientiﬁc
method that includes a variation of
this approach. Instead of making
a series of observations, such as
instances of metals that expand
when heated, and then concluding
that heat must cause all metals to
expand, he stresses the need to
test a new theory by going on to
look for negative instances—such
as metals not expanding when
they are heated.
Bacon’s inﬂuence led to a focus
on practical experimentation in
science. He was, however, criticized
for neglecting the importance of
the imaginative leaps that drive all
scientiﬁc progress. ■

that had long been obscure or
misunderstood. Hobbes had met
the Italian astronomer Galileo,
frequently regarded as the “father

closely associated with Francis
Bacon, whose thinking had helped
to revolutionize scientiﬁc practice.
In science and mathematics,
Hobbes saw the perfect counter to
the medieval Scholastic philosophy
that had sought to reconcile the
apparent contradictions between
reason and faith. In common with
many thinkers of his time, he
believed there was no limit to what
science could achieve, taking it as
a matter of fact that any question
about the nature of the world could
be answered with a scientiﬁcally
formulated explanation.

Hobbes believed that “spirits” carried
information needed to function around
the body. We now know that this is done
by electrical signals, travelling along
the neurons of the nervous system.

labelled “animal spirits” (in line
with a common view at the time)
are responsible for most animal,
and especially human, activity.
These animal spirits move around
the body, carrying with them and
passing on information, in much
the same way as we now think of
the nervous system doing.
Sometimes, Hobbes seems to
apply his concept of physical spirits
to God and other entities found in
religion, such as angels. However,
he does state that God himself,
but not other physical spirits, should
be described as “incorporeal.” For
Hobbes, the divine nature of God’s
attributes is not something that
the human mind is capable of fully
understanding, therefore the term
“incorporeal” is the only one that
recognizes and also honors the
unknowable substance of God.
Hobbes does make clear, however,
that he believes the existence and
nature of all religious entities are
matters for faith, not science, and
that God, in particular, will remain

beyond our comprehension. All it is
possible for human beings to know
about God is that he exists, and
that he is the ﬁrst cause, or creator,
of everything in the universe.

What is consciousness?
Because Hobbes considers that
human beings are purely physical,
and are therefore no more than
biological machines, he is then
faced with the problem of how to
account for our mental nature. He
makes no attempt to give an
account of how the mind can be
explained. He simply offers a
general and rather sketchy account
of what he thought science would
eventually reveal to be the case.
Even then, he only covers the
mental activities such as voluntary
motion, appetite, and aversion—all
phenomena that can be studied
and explained from a mechanistic
point of view. Hobbes has nothing
to say about what the modern-day
Australian philosopher David
Chalmers calls “the hard problem of

consciousness.” Chalmers points
out that certain functions of
consciousness—such as the use
of language and the processing
of information—can be explained
relatively easily in terms of the
mechanisms that perform those
functions, and that physicalist
philosophers have been offering
variants of this approach for
centuries. However, the harder
problem of explaining the nature of
subjective, ﬁrst-person experience
of consciousness remains unsolved
by them. There seems to be a
built-in mismatch between the
objects of the physical sciences
on the one hand and the subjects
of conscious experience on the
other—something that Hobbes
does not seem to be aware of.
Hobbes’ account of his belief
offers very little argument for his
conviction that everything in the
world, including human beings,
is wholly physical. He appears not
to notice that his grounds for the

RENAISSANCE AND THE AGE OF REASON 115
existence of imperceptible material
spirits could equally be grounds for
a belief in nonmaterial substances.
To most people, something being
imperceptible is more consistent
with a mental than with a physical
concept. In addition, because
Hobbes’ material spirits can only
ever possess the same properties
as other types of physical thing,
they fail to offer any assistance
toward an explanation of the
mental nature of human beings.

Descartes’ dualism
Hobbes also had to contend with
the very different thinking about
mind and body that Descartes set
out in his Meditations of 1641.
Descartes argues for the “Real
Distinction” between mind and
body—the notion that they are
utterly distinct sorts of substance.
In objections to Descartes’ ideas
that he expressed at the time,
Hobbes makes no comment on this
distinction. However, 14 years later,
he addressed the problem again in
a passage in his book De Corpore,
presenting and criticizing what
seems to be a muddled form of part
of Descartes’ argument. Here he
rejects the conclusion Descartes
came to—that mind and body are
two distinct substances—on the
basis that Descartes’ use of the
phrase “incorporeal substance”
is an example of insigniﬁcant or
empty language. Hobbes takes it
to mean “a body without body”,
which appears to be nonsense.
However, this deﬁnition must be
based upon his own view that all
substances are bodies; so what
Hobbes appears to present as an

mechanistic ideas, scientists such as
the physician William Harvey were

argument for his position that
there can be no incorporeal minds,
in fact depends upon his inaccurate
assumption that the only form of
substance is body, and that there
is no possibility of incorporeal
things existing at all.

A simple prejudice
As Hobbes’ deﬁnition of physical
spirits indicates, it is ultimately
unclear exactly what he took
“physical” or “corporeal” to mean.
If it was meant to be simply
anything that had three spatial
dimensions, then he would be
excluding much of what we, at
the beginning of the 21st century,
might regard as being “physical.”
For example, his theories about the
nature of the world would rule out
the science of sub-atomic physics.
In the absence of any truly clear
notion of what his key term means,
Hobbes’ insistence that everything
in the world can be explained in
physical terms begins to look less
and less like a statement of scientiﬁc
principle. Instead, it starts to appear
to be merely an unscientiﬁc—and

theories about the nature of our
world were very much in keeping
with the spirit of an age that was
to radically challenge most of the
prevailing views on human nature
and social order, as well as those
concerned with the substance and
workings of the universe that we
inhabit. It was this revolution in
thinking that laid the foundations
of our modern world. ■

the First Certainty—“I think
therefore I exist”—as the heart

idealist philosophy.

R

ené Descartes lived in the
early 17th century, during
a period sometimes called
the Scientiﬁc Revolution, an era
of rapid advances in the sciences.
The British scientist and philosopher
Francis Bacon had established a
new method for conducting scientiﬁc
experiments, based on detailed
observations and deductive
reasoning, and his methodologies
had provided a new framework for
investigating the world. Descartes
shared his excitement and optimism,
but for different reasons. Bacon
considered the practical applications
of scientiﬁc discoveries to be their
whole purpose and point, whereas
Descartes was more fascinated by
the project of extending knowledge
and understanding of the world.
During the Renaissance—the
preceding historical era—people
had become more skeptical about
science and the possibility of
genuine knowledge in general, and
this view continued to exert an
inﬂuence in Descartes’ time. So a
major motivation of his “project of
pure enquiry”, as his work has
become known, was the desire to
rid the sciences of the annoyance
of skepticism once and for all.

An evil demon may

things that are false.

There is nothing
of which I can

In the Meditations on First
Philosophy, Descartes’ most
accomplished and rigorous work
on metaphysics (the study of being
and reality) and epistemology (the
study of the nature and limits of
knowledge), he seeks to demonstrate
the possibility of knowledge even
from the most skeptical of positions,
and from this, to establish a ﬁrm
foundation for the sciences. The

Descartes’ book De Homine Figuris
takes a biological look at the causes
of knowledge. In it, he suggests that
the pineal gland is the link between
vision and conscious action.

But when I say “I am;
I exist”, I cannot be
wrong about this.

An evil demon could

this situation would leave open the
possibility that some truths, such
as mathematical axioms, could be
known, though not through the
senses. But even these “truths”
might not in fact be true, because

deceive us even at this level. Even
though we believe that God is
good, it is possible that he made ❯❯

The illusory world

An optical illusion of parallel lines that are made
to look bent can fool our senses. Descartes thinks
we must accept nothing as true or given, but must
instead strip away all preconceptions before we can
proceed to a position of knowledge.

In order to establish that his beliefs
have stability and endurance, which
Descartes takes to be two important
marks of knowledge, he uses what
is known as “the method of doubt.”
This starts with the meditator
setting aside any belief whose truth
can be doubted, whether slightly
or completely. Descartes’ aim is
to show that, even if we start from
the strongest possible skeptical
position, doubting everything, we
can still reach knowledge. The
doubt is “hyperbolic” (exaggerated),
and used only as a philosophical
tool; as Descartes points out: “no
sane person has ever seriously
doubted these things.”
Descartes starts by subjecting
his beliefs to a series of increasingly
rigorous skeptical arguments,
questioning how we can be sure
of the existence of anything at all.
Could it be that the world we know
is just an illusion? We cannot trust
our senses, as we have all been
“deceived” by them at one time or
another, and so we cannot rely on
them as a sure footing for

120 RENE DESCARTES

I shall suppose that some
malicious demon of the
utmost power and cunning
has employed all his energies
in order to deceive me.
René Descartes

An evil demon capable of deceiving
humankind about everything cannot
make me doubt my existence; if he
tries, and I am forced to question my
own existence, this only conﬁrms it.

us in such a way that we are prone
to errors in our reasoning. Or perhaps
there is no God—in which case we
are even more likely to be imperfect
beings (having arisen only by
chance) that are capable of being
deceived all the time.
Having reached a position in
which there seems to be nothing
at all of which he can be certain,
Descartes then devises a vivid tool
to help him to avoid slipping back
into preconceived opinion: he
supposes that there is a powerful
and evil demon who can deceive
him about anything. When he
ﬁnds himself considering a belief,

he can ask: “Could the demon be
making me believe this even
though it was false?” and if the
answer is “yes” he must set aside
the belief as open to doubt.
At this point, it seems as though
Descartes has put himself into an
impossible position—nothing
seems beyond doubt, so he has no
solid ground on which to stand.
He describes himself as feeling
helplessly tumbled around by a
whirlpool of universal doubt, unable
to ﬁnd his footing. Skepticism
seems to have made it impossible
for him even to begin his journey
back to knowledge and truth.

The First Certainty
It is at this point that Descartes
realizes that there is one belief that
he surely cannot doubt: his belief in
his own existence. Each of us can

think or say: “I am, I exist”, and
while we are thinking or saying it
we cannot be wrong about it. When
Descartes tries to apply the evil
demon test to this belief, he
realizes that the demon could only
make him believe that he exists if
he does in fact exist; how can he
doubt his existence unless he
exists in order to do the doubting?
This axiom—“I am, I exist”—
forms Descartes’ First Certainty.
In his earlier work, the Discourse
on the Method, he presented it
as: “I think therefore I am”, but he
abandoned this wording when
he wrote the Meditations, as the
inclusion of “therefore” makes the
statement read like a premise and
conclusion. Descartes wants the
reader—the meditating “I”—to
realize that as soon as I consider
the fact that I exist, I know it to be
true. This truth is instantly grasped.
The realization that I exist is a
direct intuition, not the conclusion
of an argument.
Despite Descartes’ move to a
clearer expression of his position,
the earlier formulation was so
catchy that it stuck in people’s
minds, and to this day the First
Certainty is generally known as
“the cogito”, from the Latin cogito

RENAISSANCE AND THE AGE OF REASON 121

ergo sum, meaning “I think
therefore I am.” St. Augustine of
Hippo had used a very similar
argument in The City of God, when
he said: “For if I am mistaken, I
exist”; meaning that if he did not
exist, he could not be mistaken.
Augustine, however, made little
use of this in his thinking, and
certainly did not reach it in the
way that Descartes did.

Descartes realizes that we might
also be able to gain knowledge
from the certainty itself. This is
because the knowledge that I am
thinking is bound up with the
knowledge of my existence. So
“thinking” is also something that
I cannot rationally doubt, for
doubting is a kind of thinking, so
to doubt that I am thinking is to
be thinking. As Descartes now
knows that he exists and that he
is thinking, then he—and every
other meditator—also knows
that he is a thinking thing.
Descartes makes clear, though,
that this is as far as he can reason
from the First Certainty. He is
certainly not entitled to say that he
is only a thinking thing—a mind—
as he has no way of knowing what
more he might be. He might be a
physical thing that also has the
ability to think, or he might be
something else, something that he
has not even conceived yet. The
point is that at this stage of his
meditations he knows only that ❯❯

What is this “I”?
Despite the fact that the First
Certainty’s main function is to
provide a ﬁrm footing for knowledge,

The only question that Descartes is deﬁnitely
able to answer using his method of doubt is whether
he is thinking. He cannot prove the existence of his
body or of the external world.

This proposition, I am,

What use, though, is a single belief?
The simplest logical argument is a
syllogism, which has two premises
and a conclusion—such as: all
birds have wings; a robin is a bird;
therefore all robins have wings. We
surely cannot get anywhere from
the starting point of just one true
belief. But Descartes was not
looking to reach these kinds of
conclusions from his First Certainty.
As he explained: “Archimedes
used to demand just one ﬁrm and
immovable point in order to shift
the entire Earth.” For Descartes, the
certainty of his own existence gives
him the equivalent; it saves him
from that whirlpool of doubt, gives
him a ﬁrm foothold, and so allows
him to start on the journey back from
skepticism to knowledge. It is crucial
to his project of enquiry, but it is not
the foundation of his epistemology.

When someone says
‘I am thinking, therefore
I am’, he recognizes
it as something self-evident
by a simple intuition
of the mind.
René Descartes

he is a thinking thing; as he puts
it, he knows only that he is, “in
the strict sense only” a thinking
thing. Later, in the sixth book of the
Meditations, Descartes presents an
argument that mind and body are
different sorts of thing—that they
are distinct substances—but he is
not yet in a position to do so.

Doubting Descartes
This First Certainty has been the
target of criticism from many
writers who hold that Descartes’
approach to skepticism is doomed

René Descartes

from the start. One of the main
arguments against it takes issue
with the very use of the term “I” in
“I am, I exist.” Although Descartes
cannot be wrong in saying that
thinking is occurring, how does he
know that there is “a thinker”—a
single, uniﬁed consciousness doing
that thinking? What gives him the
right to assert the existence of
anything beyond the thoughts? On
the other hand, can we make sense
of the notion of thoughts ﬂoating
around without a thinker?
It is difﬁcult to imagine detached,
coherent thoughts, and Descartes
argues that it is impossible to
conceive of such a state of affairs.
However, if one were to disagree,
and believe that a world of thoughts
with no thinkers is genuinely
possible, Descartes would not be
entitled to the belief that he exists,
and would thus fail to reach his
First Certainty. The existence of
thoughts would not give him the
solid ground he needed.
The problem with this notion
of thoughts ﬂoating around with
no thinker is that reasoning would
be impossible. In order to reason,
it is necessary to relate ideas in
a particular way. For example, if

Patrick has the thought “all men
are mortal” and Patricia has the
thought “Socrates is a man”,
neither can conclude anything.
But if Paula has both thoughts, she
can conclude that “Socrates is
mortal.” Merely having the thoughts
“all men are mortal” and “Socrates
is a man” ﬂoating around is like
two separate people having them;
in order for reason to be possible
we need to make these thoughts
relative to one another, to link them
in the right way. It turns out that
making thoughts relative to
anything other than a thinker
(for example, to a place or to a
time) fails to do the job. And since
reasoning is possible, Descartes
can conclude that there is a thinker.
Some modern philosophers have
denied that Descartes’ certainty of
his own existence can do the job he
requires of it; they argue that “I
exist” has no content, as it merely
refers to its subject but says nothing
meaningful or important about it;
it is simply pointing at the subject.
For this reason nothing can follow
from it, and Descartes’ project fails
at the beginning. This seems to
miss Descartes’ point; as we have
seen, he does not use the First

René Descartes was born near
Tours, France, and was educated
at the Jesuit Collège Royale, in
La Flèche. Due to ill-health, he was
allowed to stay in bed until late in
the mornings, and he formed the
habit of meditating. From the age
of 16 he concentrated on studying
mathematics, breaking off his
studies for four years to volunteer
as a soldier in Europe’s Thirty
Years War. During this time he
found his philosophical calling,
and after leaving the army, he
settled ﬁrst in Paris and then in
the Netherlands, where he spent
most of the rest of his life. In 1649

he was invited to Sweden by
Queen Christina to discuss
philosophy; he was expected to
get up very early, much against
his normal practice. He believed
that this new regime—and the
Swedish climate—caused him
to contract pneumonia, of which
he died a year later.

Certainty as a premise from which
to derive further knowledge—all
he needs is that there be a self for
him to point to. So even if “I exist”
only succeeds in pointing to the
meditator, then he has an escape
from the whirlpool of doubt.

An unreal thinker
For those who have misunderstood
Descartes to have been offering
an argument from the fact of his
thinking to the fact of his existence,
we can point out that the First
Certainty is a direct intuition, not
a logical argument. Why, though,
would it be a problem if Descartes
had been offering an argument?
As it stands, the apparent
inference “I am thinking, therefore I
exist” is missing a major premise;
that is, in order for the argument to
work it needs another premise,
such as “anything that is thinking
exists.” Sometimes an obvious
premise is not actually stated in an
argument, in which case it is
known as a suppressed premise.
But some of Descartes’ critics
complain that this suppressed
premise is not at all obvious. For
example, Hamlet, in Shakespeare’s
play, thought a great deal, but it is

We ought to enquire
as to what sort of
knowledge human reason
is capable of attaining,
before we set about
acquiring knowledge
of things in particular.
René Descartes

also clearly true that he did not
exist; so it is not true that anything
that thinks exists.
We might say that in so far as
Hamlet thought, he thought in the
ﬁctional world of a play, but he also
existed in that ﬁctional world; in so
far as he did not exist, he did not
exist in the real world. His “reality”
and thinking are linked to the same
world. But Descartes’ critics might
respond that that is precisely the
point: knowing that someone called
Hamlet was thinking—and no more
than this—does not assure us that
this person exists in the real world;
for that, we should have to know
that he was thinking in the real
world. Knowing that something or
someone—like Descartes—is
thinking, is not enough to prove
their reality in this world.
The answer to this dilemma lies
in the ﬁrst-person nature of the
Meditations, and the reasons for
Descartes’ use of the “I” throughout
now becomes clear. Because while
I might be unsure whether Hamlet
was thinking, and therefore existed,
in a ﬁctional world or the real world,
I cannot be unsure about myself.

and to establish a ﬁrm, rational
foundation for knowledge. He is
also well known for proposing that
the mind and the body are two
distinct substances—one material
(the body) and the other immaterial
(the mind)—which are nonetheless
capable of interaction. This famous
distinction, which he explains in
the Sixth Meditation, became
known as Cartesian dualism.
However, it is the rigor of
Descartes’ thought and his rejection
of any reliance on authority that are
perhaps his most important legacy.
The centuries after his death were
dominated by philosophers who
either developed his ideas or those
who took as their main task the
refutation of his thoughts, such as
Thomas Hobbes, Benedictus
Spinoza, and Gottfried Leibniz. ■

Modern philosophy
In the “Preface to the Reader” of the
Meditations, Descartes accurately
predicted that many readers would
approach his work in such a way
that most would “not bother to grasp
the proper order of my arguments
and the connection between them,
but merely try to carp at individual
sentences, as is the fashion.” On
the other hand, he also wrote that
“I do not expect any popular approval,
or indeed any wide audience”, and
in this he was much mistaken. He
is often described as the father of
modern philosophy. He sought to
give philosophy the certainty of
mathematics without recourse to
any kind of dogma or authority,

The separation of mind and body
theorized by Descartes leaves open the
following question: since all we can see
of ourselves is our bodies, how could
we prove that a robot is not conscious?

DECIDES
EVERYTHING
BLAISE PASCAL (1623–1662)

IN CONTEXT

Philosophy of mind

Imagination is a
powerful force in
human beings.

APPROACH
Voluntarism
BEFORE
c.350 BCE Aristotle says that
“imagination is the process by
which we say that an image
is presented to us,” and that
“the soul never thinks without
a mental image.”
1641 René Descartes claims
that the philosopher must
train his imagination for the
sake of gaining knowledge.
AFTER
1740 In his Treatise of Human
Nature, David Hume argues
that “nothing we imagine is
absolutely impossible.”
1787 Immanuel Kant claims
that we synthesize the
incoherent messages from
our senses into images, and
then into concepts, using
the imagination.

It can override our reason.

But it can lead either to
truths or falsehoods.

We may see beauty, justice, or
happiness where it does not
really exist.

Imagination leads
us astray.

P

ascal’s best-known book,
Pensées, is not primarily a
philosophical work. Rather,
it is a compilation of fragments from
his notes for a projected book on
Christian theology. His ideas were
aimed primarily at what he called
libertins—ex-Catholics who had
left religion as a result of the sort
of free thinking encouraged by
skeptical writers such as Montaigne.
In one of the longer fragments,
Pascal discusses imagination. He
offers little or no argument for his
claims, being concerned merely to
set down his thoughts on the matter.
Pascal’s point is that imagination
is the most powerful force in human
beings, and one of our chief sources
of error. Imagination, he says,
causes us to trust people despite
what reason tells us. For example,
because lawyers and doctors dress
up in special clothes, we tend to
trust them more. Conversely, we
pay less attention to someone who
looks shabby or odd, even if he is
talking good sense.
What makes things worse is that,
though it usually leads to falsehood,
imagination occasionally leads to
truth; if it were always false, then we
could use it as a source of certainty
by simply accepting its negation.

After presenting the case against
imagination in some detail, Pascal
suddenly ends his discussion of it
by writing: “Imagination decides
everything: it produces beauty,
justice, and happiness, which is the
greatest thing in the world.” Out of
context, it might seem that he is
praising imagination, but we can
see from what preceded this
passage that his intention is very
different. As imagination usually
leads to error, then the beauty,
justice, and happiness that it
produces will usually be false.

In the wider context of a work of
Christian theology, and especially
in light of Pascal’s emphasis on the
use of reason to bring people to
religious belief, we can see that his
aim is to show the libertins that
the life of pleasure that they have
chosen is not what they think it is.
Although they believe that they
have chosen the path of reason,
they have in fact been misled by
the power of the imagination.

Pascal’s Wager
This view is relevant to one of the
most complete notes in the Pensées,
the famous argument known as
Pascal’s Wager. The wager was
designed to give the libertins a
reason to return to the Church, and
it is a good example of “voluntarism”,
the idea that belief is a matter of
decision. Pascal accepts that it is
not possible to give good rational
grounds for religious belief, but
tries to offer rational grounds for
wanting to have such beliefs.
These consist of weighing up
the possible proﬁt and loss of
making a bet on the existence
Blaise Pascal was born in ClermontFerrand, France. He was the son
of a government functionary who
had a keen interest in science and

This led him to abandon his

Everything that
exists is made of this
one substance.

There is only
one substance.

This substance is
“God” or “nature.”

It provides everything
in our universe with its…

formation,

... its purpose,

... its shape,

... and its matter.

In these four ways, God
“causes” everything.

generally, substance is anything
that has properties—or that which
underlies the world of appearance.
Spinoza employs “substance” in a
similar way, deﬁning it as that which
is self-explanatory—or that which
can be understood by knowing its
nature alone, as opposed to all other
things that can be known only by
their relationships with other things.
For example, the concept “cart” can
only be understood with reference
to other concepts, such as “motion”,
“transport”, and so on. Moreover, for
Spinoza, there can only be one such
substance, for if there were two,
understanding one would entail
understanding its relationship with
the other, which contradicts the

deﬁnition of substance. Furthermore,
he argues, since there is only one
such substance, there can, in fact,
be nothing but that substance, and
everything else is in some sense a
part of it. Spinoza’s position is
known as “substance monism”,
which claims that all things are
ultimately aspects of a single thing,
as opposed to “substance dualism”,
which claims that there are
ultimately two kinds of things in
the universe, most commonly
deﬁned as “mind” and “matter.”

Substance as God or nature
For Spinoza, then, substance
underlies our experience, but it
can also be known by its various

attributes. He does not specify
how many attributes substance
has, but he says that human
beings, at least, can conceive of
two—namely, the attribute of
extension (physicality) and the
attribute of thought (mentality). For
this reason, Spinoza is also known
as an “attribute dualist”, and he
claims that these two attributes
cannot be explained by each other,
and so must be included in any
complete account of the world. As
for substance itself, Spinoza says
that we are right to call it “God” or
“nature” (Deus sive natura)—that
self-explaining thing which, in
human form, sees itself under the
attributes of body and mind. ❯❯

128 BENEDICTUS SPINOZA

All changes, from a change of mood
to a change in a candle’s shape, are,
for Spinoza, alterations that occur to
a single substance that has both
mental and physical attributes.

At the level of individual things,
including human beings, Spinoza’s
attribute dualism is intended in
part to deal with the question of
how minds and bodies interact.
The things that we experience as
individual bodies or minds are in
fact modiﬁcations of the single
substance as conceived under
one of the attributes. Each
modiﬁcation is both a physical
thing (in so far as it is conceived
under the attribute of extension)

Benedictus Spinoza

and a mental thing (in so far as it
is conceived under the attribute
of thought). In particular, a human
mind is a modiﬁcation of substance
conceived under the attribute of
thought, and the human brain is
the same modiﬁcation of substance
conceived under the attribute of
extension. In this way, Spinoza
avoids any question about the
interaction between mind and
body: there is no interaction, only
a one-to-one correspondence.
However, Spinoza’s theory
commits him to the view that it is
not only human beings that are
minds as well as bodies, but
everything else too. Tables, rocks,
trees—all of these are modiﬁcations
of the one substance under the
attributes of thought and extension.
So, they are all both physical and
mental things, although their
mentality is very simple and they
are not what we should call minds.
This aspect of Spinoza’s theory is
difﬁcult for many people either to
accept or to understand.

The world is God
Spinoza’s theory, which he explains
fully in Ethics, is often referred to
as a form of pantheism—the belief
Benedictus (or Baruch) Spinoza
was born in Amsterdam, the
Netherlands, in 1632. At the age
of 23 he was excommunicated
by the synagogue of Portuguese
Jews in Amsterdam, who probably
wished to distance themselves
from Spinoza’s teachings. Spinoza’s
Theological-Political Treatise
was later attacked by Christian
theologians and banned in
1674—a fate that had already
befallen the work of the French
philosopher René Descartes. The
furore caused him to withhold
publication of his greatest work,
the Ethics, until after his death.

that God is the world, and that the
world is God. Pantheism is often
criticized by theists (people who
believe in God), who argue that
it is little more than atheism by
another name. However, Spinoza’s
theory is in fact much closer to
panentheism—the view that the
world is God, but that God is more
than the world. For in Spinoza’s
system, the world is not a mass of
material and mental stuff—rather,
the world of material things is a
form of God as conceived under
the attribute of extension, and the
world of mental things is that same
form of God as conceived under the
attribute of thought. Therefore the

moral man who turned down
numerous lucrative teaching

The human mind
is part of the inﬁnite
intellect of God.
Benedictus Spinoza

According to Spinoza, all objects, whether animal,
vegetable, or mineral, have a mentality. Both their
bodies and their mentalities are a part of God,
who is greater than all the world’s physical and
mental attributes. God, for Spinoza, is the
“substance” that underlies reality.

Every object in
the universe, even
a rock, has a body
and a mind.

one substance or God is more than
the world, but the world itself is
entirely substance or God.
However, Spinoza’s God is clearly
different from the God of standard
Judaeo-Christian theology. Not
only is it not a person, it cannot be
regarded as being the creator of
the world in the sense found in the
Book of Genesis. Spinoza’s God
does not exist alone before creation,
and then bring it into existence.

Body and mind
are attributes of
substance.

Substance is God,
in whom all is
explained.

God as the cause
What can Spinoza mean, then,
when he says that God is the cause
of everything? The one substance
is “God or nature”—so even if
there is more to God than those
modiﬁcations of substance that
make up our world, how can the
relationship between God and
nature be causal?
First, we should note that
Spinoza, in common with most
philosophers before him, uses
the word “cause” in a much richer
sense than we do now—a sense
that originates in Aristotle’s
deﬁnition of four types of cause.
These are (using a statue as an
example): a formal cause, or the
relationship between a thing’s
parts (its shape or form); a material
cause, or the matter a thing is made
of (the bronze, marble, and so on);

an efﬁcient cause, or that which
brings a thing into being (the
sculpting process); and a ﬁnal cause,
or the purpose for which a thing
exists (the creation of a work of art,
the desire for money, and so on).
For Aristotle and Spinoza,
these together deﬁne “cause”, and
provide a complete explanation of a
thing—unlike today’s usage, which
tends to relate to the “efﬁcient”
or “ﬁnal” causes only. Therefore,
when Spinoza speaks of God or
substance being “self-caused” he
means that it is self-explanatory,
rather than that it is simply selfgenerating. When he talks of God

being the cause of all things, he
means that all things ﬁnd their
explanation in God.
God, therefore, is not what
Spinoza calls a “transitive” cause of
the world—something external that
brings the world into being. Rather,
God is the “immanent” cause of the
world. This means that God is in
the world, that the world is in God,
and that the existence and essence
of the world are explained by God’s
existence and essence. For Spinoza,
to fully appreciate this fact is to
attain the highest state of freedom
and salvation possible—a state
he calls “blessedness.” ■

NO MAN’S

Empiricism
BEFORE
c.380 BCE In his dialogue,
Meno, Plato argues that we
remember knowledge from
previous lives.
Mid-13th century Thomas
Aquinas puts forward the
principle that “whatever is
in our intellect must have
previously been in the senses.”

Late 17th century Gottfried
Leibniz argues that the mind

experience gradually uncovers.

J

ohn Locke is traditionally
included in the group of
philosophers known as the
British Empiricists, together with
two later philosophers, George
Berkeley and David Hume. The
empiricists are generally thought
to hold the view that all human
knowledge must come directly or
indirectly from the experience of
the world that we acquire through
the use of our senses alone. This
contrasts with the thinking of the
rationalist philosophers, such
as René Descartes, Benedictus
Spinoza, and Gottfried Leibniz,
who hold that in principle, at least,
it is possible to acquire knowledge
solely through the use of reason.

Rationalists believe that we are
born with some ideas and concepts;
that they are “innate.”

But this is not borne
out by the fact that...

...there are no truths
that are found in
everyone at birth.

...there are no universal
ideas found in people of
all cultures at all times.

Everything we
know is gained from
experience.

In fact, the division between these
two groups is not as clear-cut as
is often assumed. The rationalists
all accept that in practice our
knowledge of the world ultimately
stems from our experience, and
most notably from scientiﬁc enquiry.
Locke reaches his distinctive views
concerning the nature of the world
by applying a process of reasoning
later known as abduction (inference
to the best explanation from the
available evidence) to the facts of
sensory experience. For example,
Locke sets out to demonstrate that
the best explanation of the world
as we experience it is corpuscular
theory. This is the theory that
everything in the world is made

up of submicroscopic particles, or
corpuscles, which we can have no
direct knowledge of, but which, by
their very existence, make sense of
phenomena that would otherwise
be difﬁcult or impossible to explain.
Corpuscular theory was becoming
popular in 17th-century scientiﬁc
thinking and is fundamental to
Locke’s view of the physical world.

Innate ideas
The claim that man’s knowledge
cannot go beyond his experience
may therefore seem inappropriate,
or at least an exaggeration, when
attributed to Locke. However,
Locke does argue at some length,
in his Essay Concerning Human

If we attentively consider
newborn children, we
shall have little reason
to think that they bring
many ideas into
the world with them.
John Locke

Understanding, against the theory
proposed by the rationalists to
explain how knowledge could be
accessed without experience. This
is the theory of innate ideas.
The concept that human beings
are born with innate ideas, and that
these can give us knowledge about
the nature of the world around us,
independently of anything we may
experience, dates back to the dawn
of philosophy. Plato had developed
a concept, according to which all
genuine knowledge is essentially
located within us, but that when
we die our souls are reincarnated
into new bodies and the shock of
birth causes us to forget it all.
Education is therefore not about
learning new facts, but about
“unforgetting”, and the educator
is not a teacher but a midwife.
However, many later thinkers
countered Plato’s theory, proposing
that all knowledge cannot be innate
and that only a limited number of
concepts can be. These include the
concept of God and also that of a
perfect geometric structure, such
as an equilateral triangle. This ❯❯

132 JOHN LOCKE
type of knowledge, in their view,
can be gained without any direct
sensory experience, in the way
that it is possible to devise a
mathematical formula by using
nothing more than the powers of
reason and logic. René Descartes,
for example, declares that although
he believes that we all have an idea
of God imprinted in us—like the
mark that a craftsman makes in
the clay of a pot—this knowledge
of God’s existence can only be
brought into our conscious mind
through a process of reasoning.

Locke’s objections
Locke was against the idea that
human beings possess any kind
of innate knowledge. He takes
the view that the mind at birth
is a tabula rasa—a blank tablet or
a new sheet of paper upon which
experience writes, in the same
way that light can create images
on photographic ﬁlm. According
to Locke, we bring nothing to the
process except the basic human
ability to apply reason to the
information that we gather through

our senses. He argues that there is
not the slightest empirical evidence
to suggest that the minds of infants
are other than blank at birth, and
adds that this is also true of the
minds of the mentally deﬁcient,
stating that “they have not the least
apprehension or thought of them.”
Locke, therefore, declares that any
doctrine supporting the existence
of innate ideas must be false.
Locke also goes on to attack
the very notion of innate ideas by
arguing that it is incoherent. In
order for something to be an idea
at all, he states that it has to have
been present at some point in
somebody’s mind. But, as Locke
points out, any idea that claims
to be truly innate must also be
claiming to precede any form of
human experience. Locke accepts
that it is true, as Gottfried Leibniz
states, that an idea may exist so
deep in a person’s memory that
for a time it is difﬁcult or even
impossible to recall, and so is not
accessible to the conscious mind.
Innate ideas, on the other hand,
are believed to somehow exist

Locke believed the human mind is
like a blank canvas, or tabula rasa, at
birth. He states that all our knowledge
of the world can only come from our
experience, conveyed to us by our
senses. We can then rationalize this
knowledge to formulate new ideas.

somewhere, before the presence
of any sort of mechanism that is
capable of conceiving them and
bringing them into consciousness.
The supporters of the existence
of innate ideas often also argue
that as such ideas are present in
all human beings at birth, they
must be by nature universal,
which means that they are found
in all human societies at all points
in history. Plato, for example,
claims that everyone potentially
has access to the same basic
body of knowledge, denying any
difference in that respect between
men and women, or between
slaves and freemen. Similarly,
in Locke’s time, the theory was
frequently put forward that because
innate ideas can only be placed in
us by God, they must be universal,
as God is not capable of being so
unfair as to hand them out only
to a select group of people.
Locke counters the argument
for universal ideas by once again
bringing to our attention that a
simple examination of the world
around us will readily show that
they do no exist. Even if there
were concepts, or ideas, which

the world held in common, Locke
argues that we would have no ﬁrm
grounds for concluding that they
were also innate. He declares that
it would always be possible to
discover other explanations for
their universality, such as the fact
that they stem from the most basic
ways in which a human being
experiences the world around him,
which is something that we all
must share.
In 1704, Gottfried Leibniz wrote
a rebuttal of Locke’s empiricist
arguments in his New Essays on

John Locke

the Human Understanding. Leibniz
declares that innate ideas are the
one clear way that we can gain
knowledge that is not based upon
sensory experience, and that Locke
is wrong to deny their possibility.
The debate about whether human
beings can know anything beyond
what they perceive through their
ﬁve basic senses continues.

Language as innate
Although Locke may reject the
doctrine of innate ideas, he does
not reject the concept that human
beings have innate capacities.
Indeed, the possession of capacities
such as perception and reasoning
are central to his accounts of the
mechanism of human knowledge
and understanding. In the late
20th century, the American
philosophy Noam Chomsky took
this idea further when he put
forward his theory that there is an
innate process of thinking in every
human mind, which is capable
of generating a universal “deep
structure” of language. Chomsky
believes that regardless of their
apparent structural differences,
all human languages have been
generated from this common basis.

As the mind is a blank canvas, or
tabula rasa, at birth, Locke believes
that anybody can be transformed by
a good education, one that encourages
rational thought and individual talents.

John Locke was born in 1632, the
son of an English country lawyer.
Thanks to wealthy patrons, he
received a good education, ﬁrst
at Westminster School in London,
then at Oxford. He was impressed
with the empirical approach to
science adopted by the pioneering
chemist Robert Boyle, and he
both promoted Boyle’s ideas and
assisted in his experimental work.
Though Locke’s empiricist ideas
are important, it was his political
writing that made him famous. He
proposed a social-contract theory of
the legitimacy of government and
the idea of natural rights to private

property. Locke ﬂed England
twice, as a political exile, but
returned in 1688, after the
accession to the throne of
William and Mary. He remained
in England, writing as well as
holding various government
positions, until his death in 1704.

Locke played an important role in
questioning how human beings
acquire knowledge, at a time when
man’s understanding of the world
was expanding at an unprecedented
rate. Earlier philosophers—notably
the medieval Scholastic thinkers
such as Thomas Aquinas—had
concluded that some aspects of
reality were beyond the grasp of
the human mind. But Locke took
this a stage further. By detailed
analysis of man’s mental faculties,
he sought to set down the exact
limits of what is knowable. ■

Gottfried Leibniz
Gottfried Leibniz was a

in Leipzig, and after university
he took public service with
the Elector of Mainz for ﬁve
years, during which time he
concentrated mainly on
political writings. After a
period spent travelling, he
took up the post of librarian
to the Duke of Brunswick, in
Hanover, and remained there
until his death. It was during
this last period of his life that
he did most of the work on
the development of his unique
philosophical system.
Leibniz is famous in
mathematics for his invention
of the so-called “inﬁnitesimal
calculus” and the argument
that followed this, as both
Leibniz and Newton claimed
the discovery as their own. It
seems clear that they had in
fact reached it independently,
but Leibniz developed a much
more usable notation which
is still used today.

faculties, human beings must
also rely on experience as a
means of acquiring knowledge.

A universe in our minds
To see how Leibniz arrives at this
conclusion, we need to understand
a little of his metaphysics—his
view of how the universe is
constructed. He holds that every
part of the world, every individual
thing, has a distinct concept or
“notion” associated with it, and that
every such notion contains within
it everything that is true about
itself, including its relations to other
things. Because everything in the
universe is connected, he argues,
it follows that every notion is
connected to every other notion,
and so it is possible—at least
in principle—to follow these
connections and to discover truths
about the entire universe through

rational reﬂection alone. Such
reﬂection leads to Leibniz’s “truths
of reasoning.” However, the human
mind can grasp only a small number
of such truths (such as those of
mathematics), and so it has to
rely on experience, which yields
“truths of fact.”
So how is it possible to progress
from knowing that it is snowing,
for example, to knowing what will
happen tomorrow somewhere on the
other side of the world? For Leibniz,
the answer lies in the fact that the
universe is composed of individual,
simple substances called “monads.”
Each monad is isolated from other
monads, and each contains a
complete representation of the
whole universe in its past,
present, and future states. This
representation is synchronized
between all the monads, so that
each one has the same content.

According to Leibniz, this is how
God created things—in a state of
“pre-established harmony.”
Leibniz claims that every
human mind is a monad, and so
contains a complete representation
of the universe. It is therefore
possible in principle for us to learn
everything that there is to know
about our world and beyond simply
by exploring our own minds.
Simply by analyzing my notion of
the star Betelgeuse, for example, I
will eventually be able to determine
the temperature on the surface
of the actual star Betelgeuse.
However, in practice, the analysis
that is required for me reach this
information is impossibly
complex—Leibniz calls it “inﬁnite”
—and because I cannot complete
it, the only way that I can discover
the temperature of Betelgeuse is by
measuring it empirically using
astronomical equipment.
Is the temperature of the surface
of Betelgeuse a truth of reasoning
or a truth of fact? It may be true
that I had to resort to empirical

RENAISSANCE AND THE AGE OF REASON 137
methods to discover the answer,
but had my rational faculties been
better I could also have discovered it
through rational reﬂection. Whether
it is a truth of reasoning or a truth
of fact, therefore, seems to depend
on how I arrive at the answer—but
is this what Leibniz is claiming?

Necessary truths
The trouble for Leibniz is that he
holds that truths of reasoning are
“necessary”, meaning that it is
impossible to contradict them,
while truths of fact are “contingent”;
they can be denied without logical
contradiction. A mathematical
truth is a necessary truth, because
denying its conclusions contradicts
the meanings of its own terms.
But the proposition “it is raining
in Spain” is contingent, because
denying it does not involve a
contradiction in terms—although
it may still be factually incorrect.
Leibniz’s distinction between
truths of reasoning and truths of
fact is not simply an epistemological
one (about the limits of knowledge),
but also a metaphysical one (about
the nature of the world), and it is
not clear that his arguments
support his metaphysical claim.
Leibniz’s theory of monads seems
to suggest that all truths are truths

of reasoning, which we would have
access to if we could ﬁnish our
rational analysis. But as a truth of
reasoning is a necessary truth, in
what way is it impossible for the
temperature on Betelgeuse to be
2,401 Kelvin rather than 2,400
Kelvin? Certainly not impossible
in the sense that the proposition
2 + 2 = 5 is impossible, for the latter
is simply a logical contradiction.
Likewise, if we follow Leibniz
and separate neccesary and
contingent truths, we end up with
the following problem: I can
discover Pythagoras’s theorem
simply by reﬂecting on the idea of
triangles, so Pythagoras’s theorem
must be a truth of reasoning. But
Betelgeuse’s temperature and
Pythagoras’s theorem are both just
as true, and just as much part of
the monad that is my mind—so
why should one be considered
contingent and the other necessary?
Moreover, Leibniz tells us that
whereas no-one can reach the end of
an inﬁnite analysis, God can grasp
the whole universe at once, and so
for him all truths are neccessary
truths. The difference between a
truth of reasoning and a truth of fact,
therefore, does seem to be a matter
of how one comes to know it—and
in that case it is difﬁcult to see why
the former should always be seen
to be necessarily true, while the
latter may or may not be true.

An uncertain future

God understands
everything through eternal
truth, since he does not
need experience.
Gottfried Wilhelm
Leibniz

In setting out a scheme in which an
omnipotent, omniscient God creates
the universe, Leibniz inevitably
faces the problem of accounting for
the notion of freedom of will. How
can I choose to act in a certain way
if God already knows how I am
going to act? But the problem runs
deeper—there seems to be no room
for genuine contingency at all.

distinction between truths whose
necessity we can discover, and
truths whose necessity only God
can see. We know (if we accept
Leibniz’s theory) that the future of
the world is set by an omniscient
and benevolent god, who therefore
has created the best of all possible
worlds. But we call the future
contingent, or undetermined,
because as limited human beings
we cannot see its content.

Leibniz’s legacy
In spite of the difﬁculties inherent
in Leibniz’s theory, his ideas went
on to shape the work of numerous
philosophers, including David Hume
and Immanuel Kant. Kant reﬁned
Leibniz’s truths of reasoning and
truths of fact into the distinction
between “analytic” and “synthetic”
statements—a division that has
remained central to European
philosophy ever since.
Liebniz’s theory of monads
fared less well, and was criticized
for its metaphysical extravagance.
In the 20th century, however, the
idea was rediscovered by scientists
who were intrigued by Leibniz’s
description of space and time as
a system of relationships, rather
than the absolutes of traditional

Berkeley’s empiricism, on the
other hand, was far more extreme,
and led him to a position known
as “immaterialist idealism.” This
means that he was a monist,
believing that there is only one
kind of substance in the universe,
and an idealist, believing that
this single substance is mind,
or thought, rather than matter.

mistake it for a physical thing itself.
Ideas, then, can only resemble
other ideas. And as our only
experience of the world comes
through our ideas, any claim that
we can even understand the notion
of “physical things” is mistaken.
What we are really understanding
are mental things. The world is
constructed purely of thought, and
whatever is not itself perceiving,
exists only as one of our perceptions.

The cause of perception

better represented by esse est aut
perciperi aut percipi (“to be is to
perceive or to be perceived”). For
according to Berkeley, the world
consists only of perceiving minds
and their ideas. This is not to say
that he denies the existence of
the external world, or claims that
it is in any way different from what
we perceive. His claim is rather
that all knowledge must come
from experience, and that all we
ever have access to are our
perceptions. And since these
perceptions are simply “ideas”
(or mental representations), we
have no grounds for believing that
anything exists other than ideas
and the perceivers of ideas.

Causation and volition
Berkeley’s target was Descartes’
view of the world as elaborated
by Locke and the scientist Robert
Boyle. In this view, the physical
world is made up of a vast number
of physical particles, or “corpuscles”,
whose nature and interactions give
rise to the world as we understand
it. More controversially, for Berkeley,
this view also maintains that the
world causes the perceptual
ideas we have of it by the way
it interacts with our senses.

Berkeley has two main objections to
this view. First, he argues that our
understanding of causality (the fact
that certain events cause other
events) is based entirely on our
experience of our own volitions (the
way we cause events to happen
through the action of our wills).
His point is not simply that it is
wrong for us to project our own
experience of volitional action onto
the world—which we do when we
say that the world causes us to
have ideas about the world. His
point is that there is in fact no
such thing as a “physical cause”,
because there is no such thing as
a physical world beyond the world
of ideas that could possibly be the
cause of our ideas. The only type
of cause that there is in the world,
according to Berkeley, is precisely
the volitional kind of cause that is
the exercise of the will.
Berkeley’s second objection is
that because ideas are mental
entities, they cannot resemble
physical entities, because the two
types of thing have completely
different properties. A painting or a
photograph can resemble a physical
object because it is itself a physical
thing, but to think of an idea as
resembling a physical object is to

If things that are not perceivers
only exist in so far as they are
perceived, however, this seems to
mean that when I leave the room,
my desk, computer, books, and so
on all cease to exist, for they are no
longer being perceived. Berkeley’s
response to this is that nothing is
ever unperceived, for when I am
not in my room, it is still perceived
by God. His theory, therefore, not
only depends on the existence
of God, but of a particular type of
God—one who is constantly
involved in the world.
For Berkeley, God’s involvement
in the world runs deeper than this.
As we have seen, he claims that
there are no physical causes, but

Optical illusions are impossible, for

experience—the world simply
presents itself to me the way it does,
whether I like it or not. Therefore,
the volitions that cause my ideas
about the world are not mine; they
are God’s. So for Berkeley, God not
only creates us as perceivers, he is
the cause and constant generator
of all our perceptions. This raises
a number of questions, the most
urgent being: how is it that we
sometimes perceive things
incorrectly? Why would God
want to deceive us?
Berkeley tries to answer this
question by claiming that our
perceptions are never, in fact, in
error, and that where we go wrong is
in the judgements we make about
what we perceive. For example, if
an oar half-submerged in water
looks bent to me, then it really is
bent—where I go wrong is thinking
that it only appears to be bent.
However, what happens if I reach
into the water and feel the oar? It
certainly feels straight. And since

Can a tree fall over if there is nobody
present to observe it? Objects only exist
while they are perceived, according
to Berkeley. However, the tree
can fall over—because the
tree, and the rest of the
world, is always
perceived by God.

the oar cannot be both straight and
bent at the same time, there must
in fact be two oars—one that I
see and one that I feel. Even more
problematic for Berkeley, however,
is the fact that two different people
seeing the same oar must in fact be
seeing two different oars, for there
is no single, “real” oar “out there”
that their perceptions converge on.

The problem of solipsism

All the choir of heaven and
furniture of earth—in a word,
all those bodies which
compose the frame of the
world—have not any
subsistence without a mind.
George Berkeley

An inescapable fact of Berkeley’s
system, therefore, seems to be that
we never perceive the same things.
Each of us is locked in his own
world, cut off from the worlds of
other people. The fact that God has
an idea of an oar cannot help us
here, for that is a third idea, and
therefore a third oar. God caused
my idea and your idea, but unless
we share a single mind with each
other and with God, there are still
three different ideas, so there are
three different oars. This leads us
to the problem of solipsism—the

possibility that the only thing I
can be certain of existing—or
that may in fact exist—is myself.
One possible solution to
solipsism runs as follows: since I
can cause changes in the world,
such as raising my own hand, and
since I notice similar changes in
the bodies of other people, I can
infer that those bodies are also
changed by a “consciousness”
inside them. The problem for
Berkeley, though, is that there is no
“real” hand being lifted—the most
a person can do is be the cause of
the idea of his own hand rising—
and only their idea, not another
person’s. I, in other words, must
still rely on God to supply me with
my idea of another person’s hand
rising. Far from supplying us with
empirical certainty, therefore,
Berkeley leaves us depending
for our knowledge of the world,
and of the existence of other
minds, upon our faith in a God
that would never deceive us. ■

D

uring the Renaissance,
Europe had evolved into
a collection of separate
nation states, having previously
been a continent uniﬁed under the
control of the Church. As power
devolved to separate countries,
distinctive national cultures formed,
which were most obvious in arts
and literature, but could also be
seen in the philosophical styles that
emerged during the 17th century.
During the Age of Reason there
was a very clear difference between
the rationalism of continental
Europe and the empiricism of
British philosophers, and in the
18th century philosophy continued
to center on France and Britain, as
the Enlightenment period unfolded.
Old values and feudal systems
crumbled as the new nations
founded on trade gave rise to a

growing urban middle-class with
unprecedented prosperity. The
richest nations, such as Britain,
France, Spain, Portugal, and the
Netherlands, established colonies
and empires around the world.

France and Britain
Philosophy increasingly focused on
social and political issues, also along
national lines. In Britain, where a
revolution had already come and
gone, empiricism reached a peak
in the works of David Hume, while
the new utilitarianism dominated
political philosophy. This evolved
alongside the Industrial Revolution
that had started in the 1730s, as
thinkers such as John Stuart Mill
reﬁned the utilitarianism of Jeremy
Bentham and helped to establish
both a liberal democracy and a
framework for modern civil rights.

The situation in France, however,
was less stable. The rationalism
of René Descartes gave way to a
generation of philosophes, radical
political philosophers who were to
popularize the new scientiﬁc way
of thinking. They included the
literary satirist Voltaire and the
encyclopedist Denis Diderot, but
the most revolutionary was JeanJacques Rousseau. His vision of a
society governed on the principles
of liberté, egalité, and fraternité
(liberty, equality, and fraternity)
provided the battle cry of the
French Revolution in 1789, and has
inspired radical thinkers ever since.
Rousseau believed that civilization
was a corrupting inﬂuence on
people, who are instinctively good,
and it was this part of his thinking
set the tone for Romanticism, the
movement that followed.

In the Romantic period, European
literature, painting, and music
became preoccupied with an
idealized view of nature, in marked
contrast to the sophisticated urban
elegance of the Enlightenment.
Perhaps the key difference was the
way in which the Romantics valued
feeling and intuition above reason.
The movement took hold throughout
Europe, continuing until the end of
the 19th century.

German Idealism
German philosophy came to
dominate the 19th century, largely
due to the work of Immanuel Kant.
His idealist philosophy, which
claimed that we can never know
anything about things that exist
beyond our selves, radically altered
the course of philosophical thought.
Although only a few years younger

than Hume and Rousseau, Kant
belonged to the next generation:
his major philosophical works were
written after their deaths, and his
new explanation of the universe
and our knowledge of it managed
to integrate the approaches of
rationalism and empiricism in a way
more suited both to Romanticism
and to Germanic culture.
Kant’s followers included Fichte,
Schelling, and Hegel, who together
became known as the German
Idealists, but also Schopenhauer,
whose idiosyncratic interpretation
of Kant’s philosophy incorporated
ideas from Eastern philosophy.
Among the followers of Hegel’s
rigid Idealism was Karl Marx, who
brilliantly brought together German
philosophical methods, French
revolutionary political philosophy,
and British economic theory. After

writing the Communist Manifesto
with Friedrich Engels, he wrote Das
Kapital, arguably one of the most
inﬂuential philosophical works of all
time. Within decades of his death,
countries across the world had set
up revolutionary states on the
principles that he had proposed.
Meanwhile in the US, which
had overthrown British colonial rule
and established a republic based
on Enlightenment values, an
American culture independent
of its European roots began to
develop. At ﬁrst Romantic, by the
end of the 19th century it had
produced a homegrown strand
of philosophy, pragmatism, which
examines the nature of truth.
This was in keeping with the
country’s democratic roots and
well suited to the culture of
the new century. ■

oltaire was a French
intellectual who lived in
the Age of Enlightenment.
This period was characterized by
an intense questioning of the world
and how people live in it. European
philosophers and writers turned
their attention to the acknowledged
authorities—such as the Church
and state—to question their validity
and their ideas, while also searching
for new perspectives. Until the 17th
century, Europeans had largely
accepted the Church’s explanations

of what, why, and how things
existed, but both scientists and
philosophers had begun to
demonstrate different approaches
to establishing the truth. In 1690
the philosopher John Locke had
argued that no ideas were innate
(known at birth), and that all ideas
arise from experience alone. His
argument was given further weight
by scientist Isaac Newton whose

rebellion against the accepted
traditions that Voltaire pronounced
that certainty is absurd.
Voltaire refutes the idea of
certainty in two ways. First, he
points out that apart from a few
necessary truths of mathematics
and logic, nearly every fact and
theory in history has been revised
at some point in time. So what
appears to be “fact” is actually little
more than a working hypothesis.
Second, he agrees with Locke that
there is no such thing as an innate
idea, and points out that ideas we
seem to know as true from birth
may be only cultural, as these
change from country to country.

Revolutionary doubt
Voltaire does not assert that there
are no absolute truths, but he sees
no means of reaching them. For
this reason he thinks doubt is the

Voltaire

only logical standpoint. Given that
endless disagreement is therefore
inevitable, Voltaire says that it is
important to develop a system, such
as science, to establish agreement.
In claiming that certainty is
more pleasant than doubt, Voltaire
hints at how much easier it is
simply to accept authoritative
statements—such as those issued
by the monarchy or Church—than
it is to challenge them and think

for yourself. But Voltaire believes
it is vitally important to doubt
every “fact” and to challenge all
authority. He holds that government
should be limited but speech
uncensored, and that science and
education lead to material and
moral progress. These were
fundamental ideals of both the
Enlightenment and the French
Revolution, which took place
11 years after Voltaire’s death. ■

Voltaire was the pseudonym of
the French writer and thinker,
François Marie Arouet. He was
born into a middle-class family in
Paris, and was the youngest of
three children. He studied law
at university, but always preferred
writing, and by 1715 was famous
as a great literary wit. His satirical
writing often landed him in trouble:
he was imprisoned several times
for insulting nobility, and was
once exiled from France. This led
to a stay in England, where he fell
under the inﬂuence of English
philosophy and science. After
returning to France he became

wealthy through speculation,
and was thereafter able to
devote himself to writing. He
had several long and scandalous
affairs, and travelled widely
throughout Europe. In later life
Voltaire campaigned vigorously
for legal reform and against
religious intolerance, in France

D

avid Hume was born at
a time when European
philosophy was dominated
by a debate about the nature of
knowledge. René Descartes had
in effect set the stage for modern
philosophy in his Discourse on the
Method, instigating a movement
of rationalism in Europe, which
claimed that knowledge can be
arrived at by rational reﬂection
alone. In Britain, John Locke had
countered this with his empiricist
argument that knowledge can only
be derived from experience. George
Berkeley had followed, formulating
his own version of empiricism,
according to which the world only
exists in so far as it is perceived.
But it was Hume, the third of the
major British empiricists, who dealt
the biggest blow to rationalism in
an argument presented in his
Treatise of Human Nature.

Hume’s fork

1934 Karl Popper proposes
falsiﬁcation as the basis for the
scientiﬁc method, as opposed
to observation and induction.

language, Hume turns a sceptical
eye to the problem of knowledge,

notion that we are born with
“innate ideas” (a central tenet of
rationalism). He does so by ﬁrst

1711, Hume was a precocious
child who entered the University
of Edinburgh at the age of 12.
Around 1729 he devoted his time
to ﬁnding “some medium by
which truth might be established”,
and after working himself into a
nervous breakdown he moved to
La Flèche in Anjou, France. Here
he wrote A Treatise of Human

science, but about the nature of
the world around us.
The problem, for Hume, is that
very often we have ideas that cannot
be supported by our impressions,
and Hume concerns himself with
ﬁnding the extent to which this is
the case. To understand what
he means, we need to note that for
Hume there are only two kinds of
statement—namely “demonstrative”
and “probable” statements—and he
claims that in everyday experience
we somehow confuse the two types
of knowledge that these express.
A demonstrative statement is
one whose truth or falsity is selfevident. Take, for example, the
statement 2 + 2 = 4. Denying this
statement involves a logical
contradiction—in other words, to
claim that 2 + 2 does not equal 4
is to fail to grasp the meanings of
the terms “2” or “4” (or “+” or “=”).
Demonstrative statements in logic,
mathematics, and deductive
reasoning are known to be true or
false a priori, meaning “prior to
experience.” The truth of a ❯❯

152 DAVID HUME
probable statement, however, is not
self-evident, for it is concerned with
matters of empirical fact. For
example, any statement about the
world such as “Jim is upstairs”, is
a probable statement because it
requires empirical evidence for it
to be known to be true or false. In
other words, its truth or falsity can
only be known through some kind
of experiment—such as by going
upstairs to see if Jim is there.
In light of this, we can ask of
any statement whether it is probable
or demonstrative. If it is neither of
these, then we cannot know it to
be true or false, and so, for Hume,
it is a meaningless statement. This
division of all statements into two

possible kinds, as if forming the
horns of a dilemma, is often referred
to as “Hume’s fork.”

Inductive reasoning
There are no surprises in Hume’s
reasoning so far, but things take
a strange turn when he applies
this line of argument to inductive
inference—our ability to infer things
from past evidence. We observe an
unchanging pattern, and infer that
it will continue in the future, tacitly
assuming that nature will continue
to behave in a uniform way. For
example, we see the sun rise every
morning, and infer that it will rise
again tomorrow. But is our claim
that nature follows this uniform
The grounds for our belief that
the sun will rise tomorrow, or that
water rather than fruit will ﬂow from
a faucet, are not logical, according to
Hume. They are simply the result of
our conditioning, which teaches us
that tomorrow the world will be
the same as it is today.

pattern really justiﬁable? Claiming
that the sun will rise tomorrow is
not a demonstrative statement, as
claiming the opposite involves no
logical contradiction. Nor is it a
probable statement, as we cannot
experience the sun’s future risings.
The same problem occurs if we
apply Hume’s fork to the evidence
for causality. The statement “event
A causes event B” seems on the
face of it to be one that we can
verify, but again, this does not
stand up to scrutiny. There is no
logical contradiction involved in
denying that A causes B (as there
would be in denying that 2 + 2 = 4),
so it cannot be a demonstrative
statement. Nor can it be proved
empirically, since we cannot observe
every event A to see if it is followed
by B, so it is not a probable
statement either. The fact that, in
our limited experience, B invariably
follows A is no rational ground for
believing that A will always be
followed by B, or that A causes B.
If there is never any rational
basis for inferring cause and effect,
then what justiﬁcation do we have
for making that connection? Hume
explains this simply as “human
nature”—a mental habit that reads
uniformity into regular repetition,
and a causal connection into what

uncontrollable necessity,

as well as to breathe and feel.

detailed information about the world.
However, according to Hume, science

yield a “law of nature.”

he calls the “constant conjunction”
of events. Indeed, it is this kind of
inductive reasoning that is the
basis of science, and tempts us to
interpret our inferences as “laws”
of nature—but despite what we
may think, this practice cannot
be justiﬁed by rational argument.
In saying this, Hume makes his
strongest case against rationalism,
for he is saying that it is belief (which
he deﬁnes as “a lively idea related
to or associated with a present
impression”), guided by custom,
that lies at the heart of our claims
to knowledge rather than reason.

Custom as our guide
Hume goes on to acknowledge that
although inductive inferences are
not provable, this does not mean
that they are not useful. After all,
we still have a reasonable claim
to expect something to happen,
judging from past observation and
experience. In the absence of a
rational justiﬁcation for inductive
inference, custom is a good guide.
Hume adds, however, that this
“mental habit” should be applied
with caution. Before inferring cause
and effect between two events,
we should have evidence both that
this succession of events has been
invariable in the past, and that there
is a necessary connection between
them. We can reasonably predict
that when we let go of an object it
will fall to the ground, because this
is what has always happened in
the past, and there is an obvious
connection between letting go of
the object and its falling. On the
other hand, two clocks set a few
seconds apart will chime one after

another—but since there is no
obvious connection between them,
we should not infer that one clock’s
chiming is the cause of the other’s.
Hume’s treatment of the “problem
of induction”, as this became known,
both undermines the claims of
rationalism and elevates the role of
belief and custom in our lives. As he
says, the conclusions drawn by our
beliefs are “as satisfactory to the
mind... as the demonstrative kind.”

remained a signiﬁcant inﬂuence
on German philosophers of the 19th
century and the logical positivists of
the 20th century, who believed that
only meaningful statements could
be veriﬁable. Hume’s account of
the problem of induction remained
unchallenged throughout this period,
and resurfaced in the work of Karl
Popper, who used it to back up his
claim that a theory can only be
deemed scientiﬁc if it is falsiﬁable. ■

A revolutionary idea
The brilliantly argued and innovative
ideas in the Treatise of Human
Nature were virtually ignored when
they were published in 1739, despite
being the high-point of British
empiricism. Hume was better
known in his own country for being
the author of a History of Great
Britain than for his philosophy; in
Germany, however, the signiﬁcance
of his epistemology had more
impact. Immanuel Kant admitted
to being woken from his “dogmatic
slumbers” by reading Hume, who

the overbearing censorship of the

area of interest became political

contract as proposed by Thomas
Hobbes and reﬁned by John Locke.

Like them, Rousseau compared an
idea of humanity in a hypothetical

different view of this natural
state and the way it is affected
by society, that it could be
considered a form of “counterEnlightenment” thinking. It held
within it the seeds of the next

restrictions on these instincts.

kindly on human nature, and sees

to Rousseau when he wrote an essay
for a competition organized by the
Academy of Dijon, answering the
question: “Has the restoration of the

to reﬁning moral practices?” The

Geneva. His mother died only
a few days after his birth, and
his father ﬂed home following
a duel a few years later, leaving
him in the care of an uncle.
Aged 16, he left for France
and converted to Catholicism.
While trying to make his name
as a composer, he worked as a
civil servant and was posted to
Venice for two years, but on
his return he began to write
philosophy. His controversial
views led to his books being
banned in Switzerland and
France, and warrants being
issued for his arrest. He was
forced to accept David Hume’s
invitation to live in England for
a short time, but after they
quarrelled he returned to
France under a false name. He
was later allowed to return to
Paris, where he lived until his
death at the age of 66.

once again Rousseau contradicted
conventional thinking with his
analysis. The selﬁsh, savage, and
unjust state of nature depicted
by Hobbes is, for Rousseau, a
description not of “natural man”,
but of “civilized man”. In fact
he claims that it is civil society
that induces this savage state.
Humanity’s natural state, he
argues, is innocent, happy, and
independent: man is born free.

Society corrupts
The state of nature that Rousseau
describes is a pastoral idyll, where
people in their natural state are
fundamentally good. (The English
wrongly interpreted Rousseau’s idea
of natural man as a “noble savage”,
but this was due to a mistranslation
of the French sauvage, which means
simply “natural”, not brutish.) People
are endowed with innate virtue
and, more importantly, the attributes
of compassion and empathy. But

once this state of innocence is
disrupted, and the power of reason
begins to separate humankind from
the rest of nature, people become
detached from their natural virtues.
The imposition of civil society on
the state of nature therefore entails
a move away from virtue toward
vice, and from idyllic happiness
toward misery.
Rousseau sees the fall from a
state of nature and the establishment
of civil society as regrettable but
inevitable, because it resulted from
the human capacity for reason. The
process began, he thought, the ﬁrst
time that a man enclosed a piece
of land for himself, so introducing
the notion of property. As groups
of people began to live side by side
like this, they formed societies,
which could only be maintained
though a system of laws. But
Rousseau claims that every society
loses touch with humanity’s natural
virtues, including empathy, and so
imposes laws that are not just,
but selﬁsh. They are designed to
protect property, and they are
inﬂicted on the poor by the rich.
The move from a natural to a
civilized state therefore brought
about a move not only from virtue
to vice, Rousseau points out, but
also from innocence and freedom
to injustice and enslavement.
Although humanity is naturally
virtuous, it is corrupted by society;
and although man is born free, the
laws imposed by society condemn
him to a life “in chains.”

The Social Contract

Adam and Eve represent the kind of
perfect “natural” humans that Rousseau
thought predated society. He said that we,
like them, are corrupted by knowledge,
becoming ever more selﬁsh and unhappy.

Rousseau’s second Discourse rufﬂed
even more feathers than his ﬁrst,
but it gained him a reputation and
quite a following. His portrayal of
the state of nature as desirable and
not brutal formed a vital part of the
emerging Romantic movement in
literature. Rousseau’s rallying cry of

Tranquility is found also
in dungeons; but is that
enough to make them
desirable places to live in?
Jean-Jacques
Rousseau

“back to nature!” and his pessimistic
analysis of modern society as full of
inequalities and injustices sat well
with the growing social unrest of
the 1750s, especially in France.
Not content with merely stating
the problem, Rousseau went on to
offer a solution, in what is seen as
perhaps his most inﬂuential work,
The Social Contract.
Rousseau opens his book with
the challenging declaration “Man is
born free, yet everywhere he is in
chains”, which was considered such
a call for radical change that it was
adopted as a slogan during the
French Revolution 27 years later.
Having issued his challenge,
Rousseau then sets out his vision of
an alternative civil society, run not
by aristocrats, the monarchy, and
the Church, but by all citizens, who
participate in the business of
legislation. Modelled on Classical
republican ideas of democracy,
Rousseau imagines the citizen
body operating as a unit,
prescribing laws according to the
volonté générale, or general will.
The laws would arise from all and
apply to all—everyone would be
considered equal. In contrast with
the social contract envisaged by
Locke, which was designed to

Rousseau

protect the rights and property of
individuals, Rousseau advocates
giving legislative power to the
people as a whole, for the beneﬁt
of all, administered by the general
will. He believes that the freedom to
take part in the legislative process
would lead to an elimination of
inequality and injustice, and that
it would promote a feeling of
belonging to society—that it would
inevitably lead to the liberté,
égalité, fraternité (liberty, equality,
fraternity) that became the motto
of the new French Republic.

The evils of education
In another book written in the same
year, entitled Emile, or On Education,
Rousseau expanded on his theme,
explaining that education was
responsible for corrupting the state
of nature and perpetuating the evils
of modern society. In other books
and essays he concentrated on the
adverse effects of both conventional
religion and atheism. At the center
of all his works lay the idea that
The French Revolution, which
began 11 years after Rousseau’s death,
was inspired by his claim that it was
unjust for the rich few to rule over the
effectively voiceless, powerless poor.

reason threatens human innocence
and, in turn, freedom and happiness.
Instead of the education of the
intellect, he proposes an education
of the senses, and he suggests that
our religious faith should be guided
by the heart, not the head.

Political inﬂuence
Most of Rousseau’s writings were
immediately banned in France,
gaining him both notoriety and a
large following. By the time of his
death in 1778, revolution in France
and elsewhere was imminent, and
his idea of a social contract in which
the general will of the citizen body
controlled the legislative process
offered the revolutionaries a viable
alternative to the corrupt system as
it stood. But his philosophy was at
odds with contemporary thinking,
and his insistence that a state of
nature was superior to civilization
led him to fall out with fellow
reformers such as Voltaire and Hume.

Rousseau’s political inﬂuence was
felt most strongly during the period
of revolution immediately after
his death, but his inﬂuence on
philosophy, and political philosophy
in particular, emerged to a greater
extent in the 19th century. Georg
Hegel integrated Rousseau’s ideas
of social contract into his own
philosophical system. Later and
more importantly, Karl Marx was
particularly struck by some of
Rousseau’s work on inequality and
injustice. Unlike Robespierre, one of
the leaders of the French Revolution,
who had appropriated Rousseau’s
philosophy for his own ends during
the Reign of Terror, Marx fully
understood and developed
Rousseau’s analysis of capitalist
society and the revolutionary
means of replacing it. Marx’s
Communist Manifesto ends with
a nod to Rousseau, encouraging
the proletarians (workers) have
“nothing to lose but their chains”. ■

partly self-interested, but that
self-interest is the stronger trait
and so is a better guide to human
behavior. He believes that this can
be conﬁrmed by social observation,
and so, broadly speaking, his
approach is an empirical one. In one
of his most famous discussions of
the psychology of bargaining, he
contends that the most frequent
opening gambit in a bargain is for
one party to urge the other—“the
best way for you to get what you
want is for you to give me what I
want.” In other words, “we address
ourselves, not to [another’s]
humanity, but to their self-love.”
Smith goes on to claim that
the exchange of useful objects is a
distinctively human characteristic.
He notes that dogs are never
observed exchanging bones, and
that should an animal wish to
obtain something, the only way it
can do so is to “gain the favor of
those whose service it requires”.
Humans may also depend on this
sort of “fawning or servile attention”,
but they cannot resort to it whenever

they need help, because life requires
“the cooperation and assistance of
great multitudes.” For example, to
stay comfortably at an inn for a
night we require the input of many
people—to cook and serve the food,
to prepare the room and so on—
none of whose services can be
depended on through good will
alone. For this reason, “man is an
animal that makes bargains”—and
the bargain is struck by proposing
a deal that appears to be in the
self-interest of both parties.

The division of labor
In his account of the emergence of
market economies, Smith argues
that our ability to make bargains
put an end to the once universal
requirement that every person,
or at least every family, be
economically self-sufﬁcient. Thanks
to bargaining, it became possible
for us to concentrate on producing
fewer and fewer goods, and
ultimately to produce just a single
good, or offer a single service, and
to exchange this for everything ❯❯

The “father of modern
economics” was born in
Kirkcaldy, Fife, in 1723. An
academic prodigy, Smith
became a professor ﬁrst at
Edinburgh University, then at
Glasgow University where he
became a professor in 1750. In
the 1760s, he took a lucrative
job as a personal tutor to a
young Scottish aristocrat,
Henry Scott, with whom he
visited France and Switzerland.
Already acquainted with
David Hume and other Scottish
Enlightenment thinkers, he
seized the chance to meet
leading ﬁgures of the European
Enlightenment as well. On his
return to Scotland, he spent a
decade writing The Wealth of
Nations, before returning to
public service as Commissioner
of Customs, a position that
allowed him to advise the
British government on various
economic policies. In 1787, he
rejoined Glasgow University,
and spent the last three years
of his life as its rector.

else we required. This process was
revolutionized by the invention of
money, which abolished the need
to barter. From then on, in Smith’s
view, only those who were unable
to work had to depend on charity.
Everyone else could come to the
marketplace to exchange their
labor—or the money they earned
through labor—for the products
of other people’s labor.
This elimination of the need to
provide everything for ourselves led
to the emergence of people with
particular sets of skills (such as
the baker and the carpenter), and
then to what Smith calls a “division
of labor” among workers. This is
Smith’s phrase for specialization,
whereby an individual not only
pursues a single type of work, but
performs only a single task in a job
that is shared by several people.
The market is the key to establishing
an equitable society, in Smith’s view.
With the freedom provided by the
buying and selling of goods, individuals
can enjoy lives of “natural liberty.”

powers of labor seem
to have been the effects
of the division of labor.
Adam Smith

Civilized society stands

Adam Smith

Smith illustrates the importance of
specialization at the beginning of
his masterpiece, The Wealth of
Nations, by showing how the
making of a humble metal pin is
radically improved by adopting the
factory system. Where one man
working alone would ﬁnd it hard
to produce 20 perfect pins in a day,
a group of 10 men, charged with
different tasks—from drawing out
the wire, straightening it, cutting

it, pointing it, and grinding it, to
joining it to a pinhead—were able,
in Smith’s time, to produce over
48,000 pins a day.
Smith was impressed by
the great improvements in the
productivity of labor that took place
during the Industrial Revolution—
improvements that saw workers
provided with much better
equipment, and often saw
machines replacing workers.

THE AGE OF REVOLUTION 163
The jack-of-all-trades could not
survive in such a system, and even
philosophers began to specialize
in the various branches of their
subject, such as logic, ethics,
epistemology, and metaphysics.

The free market
Because the division of labor
increases productivity and makes it
possible for everyone to be eligible
for some kind of work (since it frees
us from training in a craft), Smith
argues that it can lead to universal
wealth in a well-ordered society.
Indeed, he says that in conditions
of perfect liberty, the market can
lead to a state of perfect equality—
one in which everyone is free to
pursue his own interests in his own
way, so long as it accords with the
laws of justice. And by equality
Smith is not referring to equality
of opportunity, but to equality of
condition. In other words, his goal
is the creation of a society not
divided by competitiveness, but
drawn together by bargaining
based on mutual self-interest.
Smith’s point, therefore, is not
that people should have freedom just
because they deserve it. His point is
that society as a whole beneﬁts from
individuals pursuing their own
interests. For the “invisible hand” of
the market, with its laws of supply
and demand, regulates the amount
of goods that are available, and
prices them far more efﬁciently than
any government could. Put simply,
the pursuit of self-interest, far
from being incompatible with an
equitable society, is, in Smith’s view,
the only way of guaranteeing it.
In such a society, a government
can limit itself to performing just a
few essential functions, such as
providing defense, criminal justice,
and education, and taxes and duties
can be reduced accordingly. And
just as bargaining can ﬂourish

within national boundaries, so it
can ﬂourish across them, leading to
international trade—a phenomenon
that was spreading across the
world in Smith’s time.
Smith recognized that there
were problems with the notion of
a free market—in particular with
the increasingly common bargain
of wages for working time. He also
acknowledged that while the
division of labor had huge
economic beneﬁts, repetitive work
is not only boring for the worker, it
can destroy a human being—and
for this reason he proposed that
governments should restrict the
extent to which the production
line is used. Nevertheless, when
The Wealth of Nations was ﬁrst
published, its doctrine of free and
unregulated trade was seen as
revolutionary, not only because of
its attack on established commercial
and agricultural privileges and
monopolies, but also because of its
argument that a nation’s wealth
depends not on its gold reserves,
but on its labor—a view that went
against all economic thinking in
Europe at the time.
Smith’s reputation for being a
revolutionary was bolstered during
the long debate about the nature
of society that followed the French
Revolution of 1789, prompting the
mid-Victorian historian H.T. Buckle
to describe The Wealth of Nations
as “probably the most important
book that has ever been written.”

Smith’s legacy
Critics have argued that Smith was
wrong to assume that the “general
interest” and “consumer interest”
are the same, and that the free
market is beneﬁcial to all. What is
true is that even though Smith was
sympathetic toward the victims of
poverty, he never fully succeeded in
balancing the interests of producers

The production line is an incredible
money-creating machine, but Smith
warns against the dehumanizing
effects it can have on workers if it
is used without regulation.

and consumers within his social
model, or integrating into it the
domestic labor, performed mainly
by women, that helped to keep
society running efﬁciently.
For these reasons, and with the
rise of socialism in the 19th century,
Smith’s reputation declined, but
renewed interest in free market
economics in the late 20th century
saw a revival of Smith’s ideas.
Indeed, only today can we fully
appreciate his most visionary
claim—that a market is more than
just a place. A market is a concept,
and as such can exist anywhere—
not only in a designated place such
as a town square. This foreshadows
the kind of “virtual” marketplace
that only became possible with the
advent of telecommunications
technology. Today’s ﬁnancial
markets and online trading bear
witness to Smith’s great vision. ■

I

mmanuel Kant thought it was
“scandalous” that in more than
2,000 years of philosophical
thought, nobody had been able to
produce an argument to prove that
there really is a world out there,
external to us. He particularly had
in mind the theories of René
Descartes and George Berkeley,
who both entertained doubts about
the existence of an external world.
At the start of his Meditations,
Descartes argued that we must
doubt all knowledge except that
of our own existence as thinking
beings—even the knowledge that
there is an external world. He then

went on to counter this sceptical
point of view with an argument
that claims to prove the existence
of God, and therefore the reality of
an outside world. However, many
philosophers (including Kant) have
not found Descartes’ proof of God
to be valid in its reasoning.
Berkeley, on the other hand,
argued that knowledge is indeed
possible—but that it comes from
experiences our consciousness
perceives. We have no justiﬁcation
for believing that these experiences
have any external existence outside
our own minds.

Time and consciousness
Kant wants to demonstrate that
there is an external, material world,
and that its existence cannot be
doubted. His argument begins as
follows: in order for something to
exist, it must be determinable in
time—that is, we must be able to
say when it exists and for how long.
But how does this work in the case
of my own consciousness?
Although consciousness seems
to be constantly changing with a
continuous ﬂow of sensations and
thoughts, we can use the word
“now” to refer to what is currently
happening in our consciousness.
But “now” is not a determinate time
or date. Every time I say “now”,
consciousness is different.
Here lies the problem: what
makes it possible to specify the
“when” of my own existence? We
cannot experience time itself,
directly; rather, we experience time
through things that move, change,
or stay the same. Consider the
hands of a clock, constantly moving
slowly around. The moving hands
are useless for determining time on
their own—they need something
against which they change, such as
the numbers on a clock face. Every
resource I have for measuring my

According to Kant, we can only
experience time through things in the
world that move or change, such as
the hands of a clock. So time is only
ever experienced by us indirectly.

constantly changing “now” is found
in material objects outside me in
space (including my own physical
body). Saying that I exist requires
a determinate point in time, and
this, in turn, requires an actually
existing outside world in which
time takes place. My level of
certainty about the existence of the
external world is thus precisely the
same as my level of certainty about
the existence of consciousness,
which Descartes believed was
absolutely certain.

The problem of science
Kant also looked at how science
understood the exterior world. He
admired the awesome progress
that the natural sciences had made
over the previous two centuries,
compared with the relative
stagnation in the subject from
ancient times until that point. Kant,
along with other philosophers,
wondered what was suddenly being
done correctly in scientiﬁc research.
The answer given by many thinkers
of the period was empiricism. The
empiricists, such as John Locke
and David Hume, argued that there
is no knowledge except that which

comes to us through our experience
of the world. They opposed the
views of rationalist philosophers,
such as Descartes or Gottfried
Leibniz, who argued that the
mind’s ability to reason and deal
with concepts is more important
for knowledge than experience.
The empiricists claimed that
the recent success of science
was due to scientists being much
more careful in their observations
of the world than they had been
previously, and making fewer
unjustiﬁed assumptions based
on reason alone. Kant argues that
although this is no doubt partly
true, it could not be the whole
answer, as it is simply false to say
that there was no detailed and
careful empirical observation in
science before the 16th century.
The real issue, Kant argues, is
that a new scientiﬁc method arose
that made empirical observations
valuable. This method involves
two elements. First, it asserts that
concepts such as force or movement
can be perfectly described by
mathematics. Second, it tests its
own conceptions of the world by
asking speciﬁc questions about
nature and observing the answers. ❯❯

168 IMMANUEL KANT

Thoughts without content
are empty; intuitions
without concepts are
blind… only from their
union can cognition arise.
Immanuel Kant

For example, the experimental
physicist Galileo Galilei wanted to
test the hypothesis that two things
of different weights will nevertheless
fall through the air at the same rate.
He designed an experiment to test
this in such a way that the only
possible explanation of the observed
result would be the truth or falsity
of the hypothesis.
Kant identiﬁes the nature and
importance of the scientiﬁc method.
He believes that this method had
put physics and other subjects on
the “secure road of a science.”
However, his investigations do not
stop there. His next question is:
“Why is our experience of the world
such that the scientiﬁc method
works?” In other words, why is our
experience of the world always
mathematical in nature, and how
is it always possible for human
reason to put questions to nature?

These direct acquaintances he
calls “intuitions.” Second is what
Kant calls the “understanding”, our
ability to have and use concepts.
For Kant, a concept is an indirect
acquaintance with things as
examples of a type of thing, such
as the concept of “book” in general.
Without concepts we would not
know our intuition was of a book;
without intuitions we would never
know that there were books at all.
Each of these elements has, in
turn, two sides. In sensibility, there
is my intuition of a particular thing
in space and time (like the book)
and my intuition of space and time
as such (my acquaintance with
what space and time are like in
general). In understanding, there is

my concept of some type of thing
(books) and my concept of a “thing”
as such (substance). A concept
such as substance deﬁnes what
it means to be a thing in general
rather than deﬁning some type
of thing like a book. My intuition
of a book and the concept of a book
are empirical, for how could I know
anything about books unless I had
come across them in the world?
But my intuition of space and time
and the concept of substance are
a priori, meaning that they are
known before or independently
of any experience.
A true empiricist would argue
against Kant that all acquaintances
come from experience—in other
words, nothing is a priori. They

Kant split knowledge into intuitions, gained
from direct sensibility of the world, and concepts,
which come indirectly from our understanding.

Our understanding that entities such
as trees undergo change presupposes an
a priori grasp of the concept “substance”,
according to Kant. Such concepts are
the preconditions of our experience.

might say that we learn what space
is by observing things in space; and
we learn what substance is from
our observation that the features
of things change without the
underlying thing itself changing.
For instance, though a tree’s leaves
turn from green to brown, and
eventually fall from the tree, it is
still the same tree.

Space and substance
Kant’s arguments show that, on
the contrary, space is an a priori
intuition. In order to learn about
things outside of me, I need to
know that they are outside of me.
But that shows that I could not
learn about space in this way: how
can I locate something outside of
me without already knowing what
“outside of me” means? Some
knowledge of space has to be
assumed before I can ever study
space empirically. We must be
familiar with space a priori.
This argument has an
extraordinary consequence.
Because space itself is a priori, it
does not belong to things in the
world. But our experience of things
in space is a feature of our

sensibility. A thing-in-itself—Kant’s
term for a thing that is considered
separately from sensibility, and
therefore exterior to our minds—
may have nothing to do with space.
Kant used similar arguments to
prove the same thing of time.
Kant then turns to proving the
existence of a priori concepts, such
as substance. He asks us ﬁrst to
distinguish between two types of
alteration: variation and change.
Variation concerns the properties
that things have: for instance, a
tree’s leaves may be green or
brown. Change is what the tree
does: the same tree changes its
leaves from green to brown. To
make this distinction is already to
use the notion of substance: the
tree (as substance) changes, but
the leaves (as the properties of
substance) vary. If we do not accept
this distinction, then we cannot
accept the validity of the concept
of substance. We would be saying
that any time there is alteration,
something “pops” into or out of
existence; the tree with green
leaves is annihilated at the same
time that the tree with brown
leaves begins to exist from nothing.
Kant needs to prove that such a
view is impossible. The key to this
is time determination. Time cannot
be directly experienced (it is not a
thing); rather, we experience time
through things that alter or do not
alter, as Kant has already shown. If
we experienced time through the
tree with green leaves and also
experienced time through the tree
with brown leaves without there
being any connection between the
two, then we would be experiencing
two separate real times. Since this
is absurd, Kant believes he has
demonstrated that the concept of
substance is absolutely essential
before we can gain any experience
of the world. And, since it is

through that experience that we
learn anything empirical, the
concept of substance could not
be empirical: it is rather a priori.

The limits of knowledge
A philosophical position that
asserts that some state or activity
of the mind is prior to and more
fundamental than things we
experience is called idealism,
and Kant calls his own position
“transcendental idealism.” He
insists that space, time, and
certain concepts are features of
the world we experience (what
Kant called the phenomenal world)
rather than features of the world
itself considered separately from
experience (what Kant called the
noumenal world).
Kant’s claims about a priori
knowledge have both positive
and negative consequences. The
positive consequence is that the
a priori nature of space, time, and
certain concepts is what makes our
experience of the world possible
and reliable. Space and time make
our experience mathematical in
nature; we can measure it against
known values. A priori concepts
such as substance make it possible
to address questions about nature
such as “Is that a substance?” and
“What properties does it exhibit ❯❯

Only from the
human standpoint can
we speak of space.

and according to what laws?” In
other words, Kant’s transcendental
idealism is what makes it possible
for our experience to be considered
useful to science.
On the negative side, certain
types of thinking call themselves
science and even resemble science,
but fail utterly. This is because
they apply to things-in-themselves
intuitions about space and time,
or concepts such as substance—
which according to Kant must be
valid for experience, but have no
validity with respect to things-inthemselves. Because they resemble
science, these types of thinking are
a constant temptation to us, and
are a trap that many fall into
without realizing it. For example,
we might wish to claim that God is
the cause of the world, but cause
and effect is another of the a priori
concepts, like substance, that Kant
believes is entirely valid for our
experienced world, but not for

things-in-themselves. So the
existence of God (considered, as it
usually is, as a being independent
of the experienced world) is not
something that could be known.
The negative consequence of
Kant's philosophy, then, is to place
quite severe restrictions on the
limits of knowledge.

Reason only has insight
into that which it
produces after a plan
of its own.
Immanuel Kant

Transcendental idealism gives
us a much more radical way of
understanding the distinction
between ourselves and the external
world. What is external to me is
interpreted as not just external to
me in space, but external to space
itself (and to time, and to all the
a priori concepts that make my
experience of the world possible).
And there are two worlds: the
“world” of experience, which
includes both my thoughts and
feelings, and also includes
experience of material things such
as my body, or books; and the
“world” of things-in-themselves,
which is precisely not experienced
and so not in any sense known, and
which we must constantly strive to
avoid fooling ourselves about.
Our bodies have a curious role
to play in all this. On the one hand,
my body as a material thing is a
part of the external world. On the
other hand, the body is a part of us,
and indeed is the medium through
which we encounter other things

Rationalism
The rationalists believed that
the use of reason, rather than
experience, leads to knowledge
of objects in the world.

Empiricism

(using our skin, nerves, eyes, ears,
and so on). This provides us with
one way of understanding the
distinction between bodies and
the external world: the body as
the medium of my sensations is
different from other external and
material things.

Lasting inﬂuence
Kant’s book Critique of Pure Reason
is arguably the most signiﬁcant
single work in the history of
modern philosophy. Indeed, the
whole subject of philosophy is often
divided by many modern thinkers
into everything that happened
before Kant, and everything that
has happened since.
Before Kant, empiricists such as
John Locke emphasized what Kant
termed sensibility, but rationalists
such as Descartes tended to
emphasize understanding. Kant
argues that our experience of the
world always involves both, so it is
frequently said that Kant combined
rationalism and empiricism.

After Kant, German philosophy in
particular progressed rapidly. The
idealists Johann Fichte, Friedrich
Schelling, and Georg Hegel all took
Kant’s thought in new directions
and, in their turn, inﬂuenced the
whole of 19th-century thought,
from romanticism to Marxism.
Kant's sophisticated critique of
metaphysical thought was also
important in positivism, which
held that every justiﬁable assertion
is capable of being scientiﬁcally
or logically veriﬁed.
The fact that Kant locates the
a priori even within our intuitions
of the world was important for
20th-century phenomenologists
such as Edmund Husserl and
Martin Heidegger, who sought to
examine objects of experience
independently of any assumptions
we may have about them. Kant’s
work also remains an important
reference point for contemporary
philosophers today, especially
in the branches of metaphysics
and epistemology. ■

Immanuel Kant was born into a
family of ﬁnancially struggling
artisans in 1724, and he lived
and worked his whole life in
the cosmopolitan Baltic port
city of Konigsberg, then part
of Prussia. Though he never
left his native province, he
became an internationally
famous philosopher within
his own lifetime.
Kant studied philosophy,
physics, and mathematics at
the University of Konigsberg,
and taught at the same
institution for the next 27
years. In 1792 his unorthodox
views led King Friedrich
Wilhelm II to ban him from
teaching, to which he returned
after the king’s death ﬁve
years later. Kant published
throughout his career, but is
best known for the series of
ground-breaking works he
produced in his 50s and 60s.
Though a bright and sociable
man, he never married, and
died at the age of 80.

Conservatism
BEFORE
c.350 BCE Aristotle argues that
society is like an organism,
and that man is by nature a
political animal.

Hippo argues that government
is a form of punishment for
“original sin.”

M

any a disaffected person
cries “It’s not my fault...
blame society!” But the
meaning of the word “society” is
not entirely clear, and it has changed
over time. During the 18th century,
when the Irish philosopher and
statesman Edmund Burke was
writing, Europe was becoming
increasingly commercialized, and

the idea that society is a mutual
agreement between its members—
like a commercial company—was
readily understood. However, this
point of view also implies that it
is only the material things in life
that matter. Burke attempts to
redress the balance by reminding
us that human beings also enrich
their lives through science, art,

Human beings have

artistic, and moral needs.

They cannot meet all these
needs through their own efforts.

and virtue, and that while society
is indeed a contract or partnership,
it is not simply concerned with
economics, or, as he puts it, “gross
animal existence.” Society embodies
the common good (our agreement
on customs, norms, and values), but
for Burke “society” means more
than just the people living now—
it also includes our ancestors and
descendants. Moreover, because
every political constitution is part
of “the great primeval contract of
eternal society”, God himself is
society’s ultimate guarantor.
Burke’s view has the doctrine
of original sin (the idea that we are
born sinful) at its core, so he has
little sympathy for anyone seeking
to blame society for their conduct.
Likewise, he dismisses the idea,
proposed by John Locke, that we
can be perfected by education—as
though we are born innocent and
merely need to be given the correct
inﬂuences. For Burke, the fallibility
of individual judgment is why we
need tradition, to give us the moral
bearings we need—an argument
that echoes David Hume, who
claimed that “custom is the great
guide to human life.”

■

Jean-Jacques Rousseau

Jacques Rousseau, whose book,
The Social Contract, argued that
the contract between citizens and
the state can be broken at any time,
depending on the will of the people.
Another regular target for Burke
was the English philosopher and
scientist Joseph Priestley, who
applauded the French Revolution
and pilloried the idea of original sin.
Despite his scepticism about
modern commercial society, Burke
was a great defender of private
property, and was optimistic about
the free market. For this reason, he is
often hailed as the “father of modern
conservatism”—a philosophy that
values both economic freedom and
tradition. Today, even socialists
would agree with Burke that private
property is a fundamental social
institution, but would disagree
with him about its value. Likewise,
ecologically-minded philosophers
share his belief in the duties of one
generation to the next, but with
the new agenda of creating a
“sustainable society.” ■

Tradition and change
Because society is an organic
structure with roots stretching
deep into the past, Burke believed
its political organization should
develop naturally over time. He
opposed the idea of sweeping or
abrupt political changes that cut
through this natural process. For
this reason he opposed the French
Revolution of 1789, foreseeing its
dangers long before the execution
of the king and the year-long Reign
of Terror. It also prompted him on
several occasions to criticize Jean-

Edmund Burke
The Anglo-Irish politician
Edmund Burke was born
and educated in Dublin. From
his youth onward, he was
convinced that philosophy
was useful training for
politics, and in the 1750s
he wrote notable essays on
aesthetics and the origins
of society. He served as an
English MP from 1766 until
1794, and he was a prominent
member of the Whig party—
the more liberal of the two
aristocratic parties of the day.
Burke was sympathetic
toward the cause of American
independence—which sparked
a revolution that was entirely
justiﬁed, in his view—and
later became involved in the
impeachment trial of Warren
Hastings, the GovernorGeneral of India. He remained
a scathing critic of colonial
malpractice for the rest of his
life, and earned a reputation
for being the conscience of
the British Empire.

Burke condemned the French
Revolution for its wholesale rejection
of the past. He believed that change
should occur gradually—an idea that
became central to modern conservatism.

Late 4th century BCE
Epicurus states that the main
goal of life should be the
pursuit of happiness.
Early 17th century Thomas
Hobbes argues that a strong

penalties for criminals, leads

Mid-18th century David
Hume claims that emotion
governs our moral judgement.
AFTER
Mid-19th century John
Stuart Mill advocates education
for all, arguing that it would
improve general happiness.
Late 19th century Henry
Sidgwick says that how moral
an action is equates directly to
the degree of pleasure it brings.

J

eremy Bentham, a legal
reformer and philosopher,
was convinced that all
human activity was driven by
only two motivating forces—the
avoidance of pain and the pursuit
of pleasure. In The Principles of
Morals and Legislation (1789), he
argues that all social and political
decisions should be made with
the aim of achieving the greatest
happiness for the greatest number
of people. Bentham believes that
the moral worth of such decisions
relates directly to their utility, or
efﬁciency, in generating happiness
or pleasure. In a society driven by
this “utilitarian” approach, he
claims that conﬂicts of interest
between individuals can be settled
by legislators, guided solely by the
principle of creating the broadest
possible spread of contentment. If
everyone can be made happy, so
much the better, but if a choice is
necessary, it is always preferable
to favor the many over the few.
One of the main beneﬁts of his
proposed system, Bentham states,
is its simplicity. By adopting his

ideas, you avoid the confusions and
misinterpretations of more complex
political systems that can often
lead to injustices and grievances.

Calculating pleasure
More controversially, Bentham
proposes a “feliciﬁc calculus” that
can express mathematically the
degree of happiness experienced
by each individual. Using this
precise method, he states, provides
an objective platform for resolving
ethical disputes, with decisions
being made in favor of the view
that is calculated to produce the
highest measure of pleasure.
Bentham also insists that all
sources of pleasure are of equal
value, so that the happiness derived
from a good meal or close friendship
is equal to that derived from an
activity that may require effort or
education, such as engaging in
philosophical debate or reading
poetry. This means that Bentham
assumes a fundamental human
equality, with complete happiness
being accessible to all, regardless
of social class or ability. ■

women have been seen as

of this arrangement began to be
openly challenged. Among the

Mary Wollstonecraft.
Many previous thinkers had
cited the physical differences
between the sexes to justify the
social inequality between women

new ideas that had been formulated
during the 17th century, such as
John Locke’s view that nearly all
knowledge was acquired through
experience and education, the
validity of such reasoning was
being called into question.

Equal education
Wollstonecraft argues that if men
and women are given the same
education they will acquire the
same good character and rational
approach to life, because they have
fundamentally similar brains and
minds. Her book, A Vindication of

the Rights of Woman, published
in 1792, was partly a response to
Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s Emile
(1762), which recommends that girls
be educated differently to boys, and
that they learn deference to them.
Wollstonecraft’s demand that
women be treated as equal citizens
to men—with equal legal, social,
and political rights—was still
largely treated with derision in the
late 18th century. But it did sow the

J

ohann Gottlieb Fichte was
an 18th-century German
philosopher and student of
Immanuel Kant. He examined how
it is possible for us to exist as
ethical beings with free will, while
living in a world that appears to be
causally determined; that is to say,
in a world where every event follows
on necessarily from previous events
and conditions, according to
unvarying laws of nature.
The idea that there is a world
like this “out there”, beyond our
selves and independent of us, is
known as dogmatism. This is an
idea that gained ground in the
Enlightenment period, but Fichte
thinks that it leaves no room for
moral values or choice. How can
people be considered to have free
will, he asks, if everything is
determined by something else
that exists outside of ourselves?
Fichte argues instead for a
version of idealism similar to Kant’s,
in which our own minds create all
that we think of as reality. In this
idealist world, the self is an active
entity or essence that exists

outside of causal inﬂuences, and
is able to think and choose freely,
independently, and spontaneously.
Fichte understands idealism and
dogmatism to be entirely different
starting points. They can never be
“mixed” into one philosophical
system, he says; there is no way of
proving philosophically which is
correct, and neither can be used to
refute the other. For this reason one
can only “choose” which philosophy
one believes in, not for objective,
rational reasons, but depending
upon “what sort of person one is.” ■

argument is the best approach.
Schlegel disagrees with the
approaches of Aristotle and René

Georg Hegel

H

egel was the single most
famous philosopher in
Germany during the ﬁrst
half of the 19th century. His central
idea was that all phenomena,
from consciousness to political
institutions, are aspects of a single
Spirit (by which he means “mind” or
“idea”) that over the course of time
is reintegrating these aspects into
itself. This process of reintegration
is what Hegel calls the “dialectic”,
and it is one that we (who are all
aspects of Spirit) understand as
“history.” Hegel is therefore a
monist, for he believes that all
things are aspects of a single thing,
and an idealist, for he believes that
reality is ultimately something
that is not material (in this case
Spirit). Hegel’s idea radically
altered the philosophical landscape,
and to fully grasp its implications
we need to take a look at the
background to his thought.

History and consciousness
Few philosophers would deny that
human beings are, to a great
extent, historical—that we inherit
things from the past, change them,
and then pass them on to future
generations. Language, for example,
Georg Hegel was born in 1770 in
Stuttgart, Germany, and studied
theology at Tübingen where he
met and became friends with the
poet Friedrich Hölderlin and the
philosopher Friedrich Schelling.
He spent several years working
as a tutor before an inheritance
allowed him to join Schelling at
the University of Jena. Hegel
was forced to leave Jena when
Napoleon’s troops occupied the
town, and just managed to rescue
his major work, Phenomenology
of Spirit, which catapulted him to
a dominant position in German
philosophy. In need of funds, he

Human beings, therefore, never
begin their existence from scratch,
but always within some kind of
context—a context that changes,
sometimes radically within a single
generation. Some things, however,
do not immediately appear to be
historical, or subject to change.
An example of such a thing is
consciousness. We know for certain
that what we are conscious of will
change, but what it means to be
conscious—what kind of a thing it
is to be awake, to be aware, to be
capable of thinking and making
decisions—is something that we
tend to believe has always been
the same for everyone. Likewise,
it seems plausible to claim that
the structures of thought are not
historical—that the kind of activity
that thinking is, and what mental
faculties it relies on (memory,
perception, understanding, and so
on), has always been the same for
everyone throughout history. This
was certainly what Hegel’s great
idealist predecessor, Immanuel
Kant, believed—and to understand
Hegel, we need to know what he
thought about Kant’s work.

Kant’s categories
For Kant, the basic ways in which
thought works, and the basic
structures of consciousness, are a
priori—that is, they exist prior to
(and so are not are not derived from)
experience. This means that they
are independent not only of what we
are thinking about, or are conscious
of, but are independent of any
historical inﬂuence or development.
Kant calls these structures
of thought “categories”, and these
include the concepts “cause”,
“substance”, “existence”, and
“reality.” For example, experience

may give us knowledge about the
outside world, but nothing within
experience itself teaches us that
the outside world actually contains,
for example, causes and effects.
For Kant, knowledge of the basic
structure of the outside world is a
priori knowledge. It is only possible
because we are all born with
categories that supply us with a
framework for experience—part of
which is the assumption that there
is an external world. However, Kant
continues, this a priori framework
means that the world as it appears ❯❯

Philosophy must begin
by making no assumptions.

We must not assume
that the structures of
thought and consciousness
never change.

We must not assume that
the whole of reality is divided
into thoughts and the
objects of thought.

These structures themselves
are aspects of spirit.

Thoughts and objects are

All reality is spirit, and
all spirit undergoes

All reality is a

Hegel’s dialectic shows how opposites ﬁnd resolution.

indeed, as the world that we
experience. Consciousness,
therefore, and not merely what
we are conscious of, is part of an
evolving process. This process is
“dialectical”—a concept that has a
very speciﬁc meaning in Hegel’s
philosophical thought.

Hegel’s dialectic

is dependent upon the nature of
the human mind, and does not
represent the world as it really is—
in other words, the world as it is “in
itself.” This “world as it is in itself”
is what Kant calls the noumenal
world, and he claims that it is
unknowable. All that we can
know, according to Kant, is the
world as it appears to us through
the framework of the categories—
and this is what Kant calls the
“phenomenal” world, or the world
of our everyday experience.

Hegel’s critique of Kant
Hegel believes that Kant made
great strides forward in eliminating
naivety in philosophy, but that his
accounts of the “world in itself”
and the categories still betray
uncritical assumptions. Hegel
argues that Kant fails in at least

two respects to be sufﬁciently
thorough in his analysis. First of
all, Hegel regards Kant’s notion of
the “world in itself” as an empty
abstraction that means nothing.
For Hegel, what exists is whatever
comes to be manifested in
consciousness—for example, as
something sensed or as something
thought. Kant’s second failure, Hegel
argues, is that he makes too many
assumptions about the nature and
origin of the categories.
Hegel’s task is to understand
these categories without making
any assumptions whatsoever,
and the worst assumption that
Hegel sees in Kant concerns the
relationships of the categories to
each other. Kant assumes that the
categories are original and distinct,
and that they are totally separate
from each other—but for Hegel

The notion of dialectic is central
to what Hegel calls his immanent
(internal) account of the development
of things. He declares that his
account will guarantee four things.
First, that no assumptions are made.
Second, that only the broadest
notions possible are employed, the
better to avoid asserting anything
without justiﬁcation. Third, that it
shows how a general notion gives
rise to other, more speciﬁc, notions.
Fourth, that this process happens
entirely from “within” the notion
itself. This fourth requirement
reveals the core of Hegel’s logic—
namely that every notion, or
“thesis”, contains within itself a
contradiction, or “antithesis”, which
is only resolved by the emergence
of a newer, richer notion, called a
“synthesis”, from the original notion
itself. One consequence of this
immanent process is that when we
become aware of the synthesis,
we realize that what we saw as the
earlier contradiction in the thesis
was only an apparent contradiction,
one that was caused by some
limitation in our understanding
of the original notion.
An example of this logical
progression appears at the
beginning of Hegel’s Science of

THE AGE OF REVOLUTION 183

philosophy is a philosophical
whole, a circle rounded and
complete in itself.
Georg Hegel

Logic, where he introduces the
most general and all-inclusive
notion of “pure being”—meaning
anything that in any sense could be
said to be. He then shows that this
concept contains a contradiction—
namely, that it requires the opposite
concept of “nothingness” or “notbeing” for it to be fully understood.
Hegel then shows that this
contradiction is simply a conﬂict

between two aspects of a single,
higher concept in which they ﬁnd
resolution. In the case of “being”
and “not-being”, the concept that
resolves them is “becoming.” When
we say that something “becomes”,
we mean that it moves from a state
of not-being to a state of being—so
it turns out that the concept of
“being” that we started off with
was not really a single concept at
all, but merely one aspect of the
three-part notion of “becoming.”
The vital point here is that the
concept of “becoming” is not
introduced from “outside”, as it
were, to resolve the contradiction
between “being” and “not-being.”
On the contrary, Hegel’s analysis
shows that “becoming” was always
the meaning of “being” and “notbeing”, and that all we had to do
was analyze these concepts to see
their underlying logic.
This resolution of a thesis (being)
with its antithesis (not-being) in a
synthesis (becoming) is just the

beginning of the dialectical process,
which goes on to repeat itself at
a higher level. That is, any new
synthesis turns out, on further
analysis, to involve its own
contradiction, and this in turn
is overcome by a still richer or
“higher” notion. All ideas, according
to Hegel, are interconnected in this
way, and the process of revealing
those connections is what Hegel
calls his “dialectical method.”
In saying that the structures of
thought are dialectical, therefore,
Hegel means that they are not
distinct and irreducible, as Kant
maintained, but that they emerge
from the broadest, emptiest notions
by means of this movement of selfcontradiction and resolution.

In Hegel’s view, a synthesis emerging from
an antagonism of thesis and antithesis itself
becomes a new thesis, which generates its
own antithesis—which ﬁnally gives birth
to another synthesis. This dialectical
process is one in which Spirit comes to
ever more accurate understandings
of itself—culminating in
the philosophy of Hegel,
in which it achieves
complete understanding.

about this method of philosophy—
that it starts without assumptions
and from the least controversial
point, and allows ever richer and
truer concepts to reveal themselves
through the process of dialectical
unfolding. On the other hand,
however, Hegel clearly argues that
these developments are not simply
interesting facts of logic, but are real
developments that can be seen at
work in history. For example, a man
from ancient Greece and a man
living in the modern world will
obviously think about different
things, but Hegel claims that their
very ways of thinking are different,
and represent different kinds of
consciousness—or different stages
in the historical development of
thought and consciousness.
Hegel’s ﬁrst major work,
Phenomenology of Spirit, gives
an account of the dialectical

development of these forms of
consciousness. He starts with the
types of consciousness that an
individual human being might
possess, and works up to collective
forms of consciousness. He does so
in such a way as to show that these
types of consciousness are to be
found externalized in particular
historical periods or events—most
famously, for example, in the
American and French revolutions.
Indeed, Hegel even argues that
at certain times in history, Spirit’s
next revolutionary change may
manifest itself as an individual
(such as Napoleon Bonaparte) who,
as an individual consciousness, is
completely unaware of his or her
role in the history of Spirit. And the
progress that these individuals
make is always characterized by
the freeing of aspects of Spirit (in
human form) from recurring states

of oppression —of overcoming
tyrannies that may themselves be
the result of the overcoming of
previous tyrannies.
This extraordinary idea—that
the nature of consciousness has
changed through time, and changed
in accordance with a pattern that is
visible in history—means that
there is nothing about human
beings that is not historical in
character. Moreover, this historical
development of consciousness
cannot simply have happened at
random. Since it is a dialectical
process, it must in some sense
contain both a particular sense of
direction and an end point. Hegel
calls this end point “Absolute
Spirit”—and by this he means a
future stage of consciousness
which no longer even belongs to
individuals, but which instead
belongs to reality as a whole.
At this point in its development,
knowledge is complete—as it must
be, according to Hegel, since Spirit
encompasses, through dialectical
Napoleon Bonaparte, according to
Hegel, perfectly embodied the zeitgeist
(spirit of the age) and was able, through
his actions, to move history into the
next stage of its development.

end is it what it truly is.

synthesis, both the knower and
what is known. Furthermore, Spirit
grasps this knowledge as nothing
other than its own completed
essence—the full assimilation of
all forms of “otherness” that were
always parts of itself, however
unknowingly. In other words, Spirit
does not simply come to encompass
reality—it comes to be aware of
itself as having always been nothing
other than the movement toward
this encompassing of reality. As
Hegel writes in The Phenomenology
of Spirit, “History is a conscious,
self-mediating process—[it is]
Spirit emptied out into time.”

Spirit and nature
But what about the world in which
we live, and which seems to go its
way quite separately from human
history? What does it mean to say
that reality itself is historical?
According to Hegel, what we
ordinarily call “nature” or “the world”
is also Spirit. “Nature is to be
regarded as a system of stages,” he
writes, “one arising necessarily from
the other and being the proximate
truth of the stage from which it
results.” He goes on to claim that
one of the stages of nature is the
progression from that which is

“only Life” (nature as a living whole)
to that which has “existence as
Spirit” (the whole of nature now
revealed as always having been,
when properly understood, Spirit).
At this stage of nature, a different
dialectic begins, namely that of
consciousness itself—of the forms
that Absolute Spirit takes in its
dialectical progression toward selfrealization. Hegel’s account
of this progression begins with
consciousness ﬁrst thinking of
itself as an individual thing among
other individuals, and occupying a
separate space to that of matter or
the natural world. Later stages of
consciousness, however, are no
longer those of individuals, but are
those of social or political groups—
and so the dialectic continues,
reﬁning itself until it reaches the
stage of Absolute Spirit.

only one reality—that of Spirit,
which knows and reﬂects on
itself, and is both thought and
what is thought about.
The “Whole of Spirit”, or
“Absolute Spirit”, is the end point
of Hegel’s dialectic. However,
the preceding stages are not left
behind, as it were, but are revealed
as insufﬁciently analyzed aspects
of Spirit as a whole. Indeed, what
we think of as an individual person
is not a separate constituent of
reality, but is an aspect of how
Spirit develops—or how it “empties
itself out into time.” Thus, Hegel
writes, “The True is the Whole.
But the Whole is nothing other
than the essence consummating
itself through its development.”
Reality is Spirit—both thought
and what is known by thought—
and undergoes a process of
historical development. ■

Spirit and mind
At the time Hegel was writing,
there was a dominant philosophical
view that there are two kinds of
entities in the world—things that
exist in the physical world and
thoughts about those things—
these latter being something like
pictures or images of the things.
Hegel argues that all versions of
this distinction are mistakes, and
involve committing ourselves to the
ridiculous scenario in which two
things are both absolutely different
(things and thoughts), but also
somehow similar (because the
thoughts are images of things).
Hegel argues that it only seems
as though the objects of thought are
different from thought itself. For
Hegel, the illusion of difference and
separation between these two
apparent “worlds” is shown as such
when both thought and nature are
revealed as aspects of Spirit. This
illusion is overcome in Absolute
Spirit, when we see that there is

senses (phenomena), and “things in

wanted to explain the nature of the
phenomenal and noumenal worlds.

Interpreting Kant
According to Kant, we each
construct a version of the world
from our perceptions—the
phenomenal world—but we can
never experience the noumenal
world as it is “in itself.” So we each
have a limited vision of the world,
as our perceptions are built from
information acquired through a
limited set of senses. Schopenhauer
adds to this that “every man takes
the limits of his own ﬁeld of vision
for the limits of the world.”

The idea of knowledge being
limited to our experience was not
an entirely new one; the ancient
philosopher Empedocles had said
that “each man believes only his
experience”, and in the 17th
century John Locke had asserted
that “no man’s knowledge here can
go beyond his experience.” But the
reason Schopenhauer gives for this
limitation is quite new, and it
comes from his interpretation of
Kant’s phenomenal and noumenal
worlds. The important difference
between Kant and Schopenhauer
is that for Schopenhauer, the
phenomenal and noumenal are
not two different realities or worlds,
but the same world, experienced ❯❯

Arthur Schopenhauer
Born into a wealthy and
cosmopolitan family in Danzig
(now Gdansk), Schopenhauer
was expected to become a
merchant like his father. He
travelled through France and
England before his family
settled in Hamburg in 1793. In
1805, after his father’s death—
possibly by suicide—he felt
able to stop working and go to
university, where he studied
philosophy and psychology.
He maintained an uneasy
relationship with his mother,
who constantly criticized
his achievements.
After completing his
studies, Schopenhauer taught
at Berlin University. He attained
a reputation as a philanderer
and misogynist; he had several
affairs and avoided marriage,
and was once convicted of
assaulting a woman. In 1831
he moved to Frankfurt, where
he lived until his death with a
succession of poodles called
either Atman (“soul” in
Hinduism and Buddhism) or
Butz (German for hobgoblin).

differently. It is one world, with two
aspects: Will and Representation.
This is most easily evidenced by our
bodies, which we experience in two
ways: we perceive them as objects
(Representations), and experience
them from within (as Will).
Schopenhauer says that an act
of will, such as wishing to raise my
arm, and the resulting movement,
are not in two different worlds—the
noumenal and phenomenal—but
the same event experienced in two
different ways. One is experienced
from inside, the other observed
from outside. When we look at
things outside ourselves, although
we see only their objective
Representation, not their inner
reality or Will, the world as a whole
still has the same simultaneous
outer and inner existences.

A universal Will
Schopenhauer uses the word “will”
to express a pure energy that has
no driving direction, and yet is
responsible for everything that
manifests itself in the phenomenal
world. He believes, like Kant, that
space and time belong in the
phenomenal world—they are

Bhagavad Gita, in which Krishna the

free himself from his cravings.

concepts within our minds, not
things outside of them—so the
Will of the world does not mark
time, or follow causal or spatial
laws. This means it must be
timeless and indivisible, and so
must our individual wills. It follows,
then, that the Will of the universe
and individual will are one and the
same thing, and the phenomenal
world is controlled by this vast,
timeless, motiveless Will.

The fundament upon
which all our knowledge
and learning rests
is the inexplicable.
Arthur Schopenhauer

Eastern inﬂuence
At this point in his argument,
Schopenhauer’s pessimism shows
through. Where contemporaries
such as Hegel saw will as a positive
force, Schopenhauer sees humanity
at the mercy of a mindless, aimless
universal Will. It lies behind our
most basic urges, he insists, and
is what causes us to live lives of
constant disappointment and
frustration as we attempt to relieve
our cravings. For Schopenhauer, the
world is neither good nor bad, but
meaningless, and humans who
struggle to ﬁnd happiness achieve
at best gratiﬁcation and at worst
pain and suffering.
The only escape from this
miserable condition, according to
Schopenhauer, is nonexistence or
at least a loss of will for gratiﬁcation.
He proposes that relief can be found
through aesthetic contemplation,
especially in music, which is the
one art that does not attempt to
represent the phenomenal world.
Schopenhauer’s philosophy here
echoes the Buddhist concept of
nirvana (a transcendent state free
from desire or suffering). He had
studied Eastern thinkers and
religions in great detail.
From his idea of one universal
Will, Schopenhauer develops a
moral philosophy that may be
somewhat surprising, considering
his otherwise misanthropic and

pessimistic character. He realizes
that if we can recognize that our
separateness from the universe is
essentially an illusion—because all
our individual wills and the Will of
the universe are one and the same
thing—we can learn empathy with
everyone and everything else, and
moral goodness can arise from a
universal compassion. Here, again,
Schopenhauer’s thinking reﬂects
the ideals of Eastern philosophy.

Lasting legacy
Schopenhauer was largely ignored
by other German philosophers in
his lifetime, and his ideas were
overshadowed by those of Hegel,
though he did have an inﬂuence
on writers and musicians. Toward
the end of the 19th century, the
primacy he gave to Will became
a theme in philosophy once more.
Friedrich Nietzsche in particular
acknowledged his inﬂuence, and
Henri Bergson and the American
pragmatists also owe something
to his analysis of the world as Will.
Perhaps Schopenhauer’s greatest
inﬂuence, however, was in the ﬁeld
of psychology, where his ideas
about our basic urges and their
frustration inﬂuenced the
psychoanalytic theories of both
Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung. ■

intellectual heritage with the new

approach is less sceptical than

knowledge comes from sense

experience, and nothing is certain)
and less dogmatic than Bentham
(who insisted that everything be
judged on its usefulness), but their
empiricism and utilitarianism
informed his thinking. Mill’s moral

extreme than his predecessors’,
aiming for reform rather than
revolution, and it formed the basis

program began with teaching
Greek to John when he was
only three years old.
After years of intense study,
Mill suffered a breakdown
at the age of 20. He left
university to work for the East
India Company, where he
stayed until his retirement in
1857, as it gave him a living
and time to write. During this
period he met Harriet Taylor,
advocate of women’s rights,
who—after a relationship of 20
years—eventually became his
wife. Mill served as a Member
of Parliament from 1865 to

turned his attention to moral
philosophy, particularly Bentham’s
theories of utilitarianism. He had
been struck by the elegant simplicity
of Bentham’s principle of “the
greatest happiness for the greatest
number”, and was a ﬁrm believer in
its usefulness. He describes his
interpretation of how utilitarianism
might be applied as similar to Jesus
of Nazareth’s “golden rule”: do as
you would be done by, and love your
neighbor as yourself. This, he says,
constitutes “the ideal perfection of
utilitarian morality.”

Legislating for liberty
Mill supports Bentham’s happiness
principle, but he thinks it lacks
practicality. Bentham had seen the
idea as depending upon an abstract
“feliciﬁc calculus” (an algorithm for
calculating happiness), but Mill

wants to ﬁnd out how it might
be implemented in the real world.
He is interested in the social and
political implications of the principle,
rather than merely its use in
making moral decisions. How
would legislation promoting the
”greatest happiness of the greatest
number” actually affect the
individual? Might laws that sought
to do this, enacting a kind of majority
rule, actually prevent some people
from achieving happiness?
Mill thinks that the solution
is for education and public opinion
to work together to establish an
“indissoluble association” between
an individual’s happiness and the
good of society. As a result, people
would always be motivated to act
not only for their own good or
happiness, but toward that of
everyone. He concludes that society

dissatisﬁed than
a fool satisﬁed.
John Stuart Mill

should therefore allow all individuals
the freedom to pursue happiness.
Furthermore, he says that this
right should be protected by the
government, and that legislation
should be drawn up to protect the
individual’s freedom to pursue
personal goals. There is, however,
one situation in which this freedom
should be curtailed, Mill says, and
that is where one person’s action
impinges on the happiness of
others. This is known as the “harm
principle.” He underlines this by
pointing out that in these cases, a
person’s “own good, either physical
or moral, is not a sufﬁcient warrant.”

Quantifying happiness
Mill then turns his attention to how
best to measure happiness. Bentham
had considered the duration and
intensity of pleasures in his feliciﬁc
calculus, but Mill thinks it is also
important to consider the quality
of pleasure. By this, he is referring
to the difference between a simple
satisfaction of desires and sensual
pleasures, and happiness gained

in a biblical parable that demonstrates
Mill’s golden rule: do as you would be
done by. He believed this would raise

THE AGE OF REVOLUTION 193
through intellectual and cultural
pursuits. In the “happiness
equation” he gives more weight
to higher, intellectual pleasures
than to baser, physical ones.
In line with his empiricist
background, Mill then tries to pin
down the essence of happiness.
What is it, he asks, that each
individual is striving to achieve?
What causes happiness? He
decides that “the sole evidence it is
possible to produce that anything
is desirable, is that people do
actually desire it.” This seems a
rather unsatisfactory explanation,
but he goes on to distinguish
between two different desires:
unmotivated desires (the things we
want that will give us pleasure) and
conscientious actions (the things
we do out a sense of duty or charity,
often against our immediate
inclination, that ultimately bring
us pleasure). In the ﬁrst case, we
desire something as a part of our
happiness, but in the second we
desire it as a means to our
happiness, which is felt only when
the act reaches its virtuous end.

Practical utilitarianism
Mill was not a purely academic
philosopher, and he believed his
ideas should be put into practice,
so he considered what this might
mean in terms of government and
legislation. He saw any restriction
of the individual’s freedom to pursue
happiness as a tyranny, whether
this was the collective tyranny of
the majority (through democratic
election) or the singular rule of a
despot. He therefore suggested
practical measures to restrict the
power of society over the individual,
and to protect the rights of the
individual to free expression.
In his time as a Member of
Parliament, Mill proposed many
reforms which were not to come

Suffrage was set up in Britain in 1868,

about until much later, but his
speeches brought the liberal
applications of his utilitarian
philosophy to the attention of a
wide public. As a philosopher and
politician, he argued strongly in
defense of free speech, for the
promotion of basic human rights,
and against slavery—all of which
were obvious practical applications
of his utilitarianism. Strongly
inﬂuenced by his wife Harriet
Taylor-Mill, he was the ﬁrst British
parliamentarian to propose votes
for women as part of his government
reforms. His liberalist philosophy
also encompassed economics, and
contrary to his father’s economic
theories, he advocated a freemarket economy where government
intervention is kept to a minimum.

A softer revolution
Mill places the individual, rather than
society, at the center of his utilitarian
philosophy. What is important is
that individuals are free to think
and act as they please, without
interference, even if what they do is
harmful to them. Every individual,
says Mill in his essay On Liberty,
is “sovereign over his own body

and mind.” His ideas came to
embody Victorian liberalism,
softening the radical ideas that had
led to revolutions in Europe and
America, and combining them with
the idea of freedom from interference
by authority. This, for Mill, is the
basis for just governance and the
means to social progress, which
was an important Victorian ideal.
He believes that if society leaves
individuals to live in a way that
makes them happy, it enables them
to achieve their potential. This
in turn beneﬁts society, as the
achievements of individual talents
contribute to the good of all.
In his own lifetime Mill was
regarded as a signiﬁcant philosopher,
and he is now considered by many
to be the architect of Victorian
liberalism. His utilitarian-inspired
philosophy had a direct inﬂuence on
social, political, philosophical, and
economic thinking well into the
20th century. Modern economics
has been shaped from various
interpretations of his application
of utilitarianism to the free market,
notably by the British economist
John Maynard Keynes. In the ﬁeld
of ethics, philosophers such as
Bertrand Russell, Karl Popper,
William James, and John Rawls all
took Mill as their starting point. ■

Like Hegel, he sees moral decisions
as a choice between the hedonistic
(self-gratifying) and the ethical. But
where Hegel thought this choice was
largely determined by the historical
and environmental conditions of our
times, Kierkegaard believes that
moral choices are absolutely free,
and above all subjective. It is our will
alone that determines our judgement,
he says. However, far from being a
reason for happiness, this complete
freedom of choice provokes in us a
feeling of anxiety or dread.
Kierkegaard explains this feeling
in his book, The Concept of Anxiety.
As an example, he asks us to
consider a man standing on a cliff
or tall building. If this man looks
over the edge, he experiences two
different kinds of fear: the fear of
falling, and fear brought on by the
impulse to throw himself off the
edge. This second type of fear, or
anxiety, arises from the realization
that he has absolute freedom to
choose whether to jump or not,
and this fear is as dizzying as his
vertigo. Kierkegaard suggests that

in all our moral choices, when we
realize that we have the freedom
to make even the most terrifying
decisions. He describes this anxiety
as “the dizziness of freedom”, and
goes on to explain that although it
induces despair, it can also shake
us from our unthinking responses
by making us more aware of the
available choices. In this way it
increases our self-awareness and
sense of personal responsibility.

The father of existentialism
Kierkegaard’s ideas were largely
rejected by his contemporaries, but
proved highly inﬂuential to later

importance and freedom of our
choices, and our continual search
for meaning and purpose, was
to provide the framework for

C

an the complex history
of the human species be
reduced to a single formula?
One of the greatest thinkers of the
19th century, Karl Marx, believed
that it could. He opened the ﬁrst
chapter of his most famous work,
The Communist Manifesto, with
the claim that all historical change
comes about as the result of an
ongoing conﬂict between dominant
(upper) and subordinate (lower)
social classes, and that the roots
of this conﬂict lie in economics.
Marx believed that he had
gained a uniquely important
insight into the nature of society

through the ages. Earlier approaches
to history had emphasized the role
of individual heroes and leaders, or
stressed the role played by ideas,
but Marx focused on a long
succession of group conﬂicts,
including those between ancient
masters and slaves, medieval lords
and serfs, and modern employers
and their employees. It was conﬂicts
between these classes, he claimed,
that caused revolutionary change.

The Communist Manifesto
Marx wrote the Manifesto with
the German philosopher Friedrich
Engels, whom he had met when
they were both studying academic
philosophy in Germany during the
late 1830s. Engels offered ﬁnancial
support, ideas, and superior writing
skills, but Marx was acknowledged
as the real genius behind their
combined publications.
In their private manuscripts
from the early and mid-1840s, Marx
and Engels emphasized that while
previous philosophers had only
sought to interpret the world, the
whole point of their activities was
to change it. During the 1850s and
60s Marx reﬁned his ideas in many
short documents, including The
Communist Manifesto, a pamphlet
of about 40 pages.
The Manifesto seeks to explain
the values and political plans of
communism—a new belief system
put forward by a small and relatively
new group of radical German
socialists. The Manifesto claims
that society had simpliﬁed into
two classes in direct conﬂict: the
bourgeoisie (the capital-owning
class) and the proletariat (the
working class).
The word “bourgeoisie” is
derived from the French word
burgeis, or burgher: a propertyowning tradesman who had risen
above the general populace to own

Intellectual debate was widespread in
Germany at the time Marx was writing,

ideas, but to bring about real change.

and run his own business. Marx
describes how the discovery and
colonization of America, the opening
of the Indian and Chinese markets,
and the increase in the commodities
that could be exchanged had, by
the mid-19th century, led to the
rapid development of commerce
and industry. Craftsmen no longer
produced enough goods for the
growing needs of new markets, and
so the manufacturing system had
taken their place. As the Manifesto
relates, “the markets kept growing,
demand ever rising.”

Values of the bourgeoisie
Marx claims that the bourgeoisie,
who controlled all this trade, had left
no link between people other “than
naked self-interest, than callous
‘cash payment.’” People were once
valued for who they were, but the
bourgeoisie “has resolved personal
worth into exchange value.” Moral,
religious, and even sentimental
values had been cast aside, as

THE AGE OF REVOLUTION 199

everyone—from scientists and
lawyers to priests and poets—had
been transformed into nothing but
a paid laborer. In place of religious
and political “illusions”, Marx writes,
the bourgeoisie had “substituted
naked, shameless, direct, brutal
exploitation.” Charters that had once
protected people’s freedom had been
cast aside for one “unconscionable
freedom—Free Trade.”
The only solution, according to
Marx, was for all the instruments of
economic production (such as land,
raw materials, tools, and factories)
to become common property, so
that every member of society could
work according to their capacities,
and consume according to their
needs. This was the only way to
prevent the rich from living at the
expense of the poor.

Dialectical change
The philosophy behind Marx’s
reasoning on the process of change
came largely from his predecessor,
Georg Hegel, who had described
reality not as a state of affairs, but
as a process of continual change.
The change was caused, he said,
by the fact that every idea or state
of affairs (known as the “thesis”) ❯❯

200 KARL MARX
contains within it an internal
conﬂict (the “antithesis”) that
eventually forces a change to occur,
leading to a new idea or state of
affairs (the “synthesis”). This
process is known as the dialectic.
Hegel believed that we can never
experience things in the world as
they are, but only as they appear to
us. For him, existence primarily
consists of mind or spirit, so the
journey of history, through countless
cycles of the dialectic, is essentially
the progress of spirit, or Geist,
toward a state of absolute harmony.
But it is here that Hegel and Marx
part company. Marx insists that the
process is not a journey of spiritual
development, but of real historical
change. Marx claims that the ﬁnal,
conﬂict-free state that lies at the end
of the process is not the spiritual
bliss that Hegel predicted, but the
perfect society, where everyone
works harmoniously toward the
good of a greater whole.

The formation of classes
In earlier ages, humans had been
entirely responsible for producing
everything they needed—such as

clothing, food, and habitation—
for themselves, but as the early
societies began to form, people
came to rely more on one another.
This led to the form of “bargain
making” described by the Scottish
economist and philosopher Adam
Smith, as people exchanged goods
or labor. Marx agrees with Smith
that this system of exchange led
people to specialize in their labor,
but he points out that this new
specialization (or “job”) had also
come to deﬁne them. Whatever a
person’s specialization or job, be it
agricultural laborer or hereditary
landowner, it had come to dictate
where he or she lived, what they
ate, and what they wore; it also
dictated with whom in society they
shared interests, and with whom
their interests lay in conﬂict. Over
time, this led to the formation of
distinct socio-economic classes,
locked into conﬂict.
According to Marx, there have
been four major stages in human
history, which he sees as based on
four different forms of property
ownership: the original tribal
system of common property; the

age have ever been the

ancient communal and state
system of ownership (where both
slavery and private property began);
the feudal or estate system of
property; and the modern system of
capitalist production. Each of these
stages represents a different form
of economic system, or “mode of
production”, and the transitions
between them are marked in
history by stormy political events,
such as wars and revolutions, as
one ruling class is displaced by
another. The Communist Manifesto
popularized the idea that through
understanding the system of
property ownership in any one
society, in any particular era, we can
acquire the key to understanding
its social relations.

Rise of cultural institutions
Marx also believes that an analysis
of the economic basis of any society
allows us to see that as its system
of property alters, so too do its
“superstructures”—such as its
politics, laws, art, religions, and

philosophies. These develop to
serve the interests of the ruling
class, promoting its values and
interests, and diverting attention
away from political realities.
However, even this ruling class is
not, in fact, determining events or
institutions. Hegel had said that
every age is held in the sway of the
Zeitgeist, or spirit of the age, and
Marx agrees. But where Hegel saw
the Zeitgeist as determined by an
Absolute Spirit developing over
time, Marx sees it as deﬁned by
the social and economic relations
of an era. These deﬁne the ideas or
“consciousness” of individuals and
societies. In Marx’s view, people
do not make a stamp on their era,
molding it into a particular shape;
the era deﬁnes the people.
Marx’s revision of Hegel’s
philosophy from a journey of spirit
to one of social and economic
modes of production was also
inﬂuenced by another German
philosopher, Ludwig Feuerbach.
Feuerbach believed that traditional

religion is intellectually false—it is
not corroborated in any way by
reasoning—and that it contributes
to the general sum of human misery.
He claimed that people make
gods in their own image from
an amalgamation of humanity’s
greatest virtues, and then cling to
these gods and invented religions,
preferring their “dreams” to the real
world. People become alienated
from themselves, through an
unfavorable comparison of their
selves to a god that they have
forgotten they created.
Marx agrees that people cling
to religion because they long for
a place in which the self is not
despised or alienated, but he says
that this is not due to some
authoritarian god, but to material
facts in their actual, daily lives.
The answer for Marx lies not only
in the end of religion, but in total
social and political change.

A Marxist utopia
In addition to its general account
of human history leading to the rise
of the bourgeois and proletarian
classes, The Communist Manifesto

makes a variety of other claims
about politics, society, and
economics. For example, it argues
that the capitalist system is not
merely exploitative, but also
inherently ﬁnancially unstable,
leading to the recurrence of
increasingly severe commercial
crises, the growing poverty of the
workforce, and the emergence of
the proletariat as the one genuinely
revolutionary class. For the ﬁrst
time in history, this revolutionary
class would represent the vast
majority of humanity.
These developments are seen
as underpinned by the increasingly
complex nature of the process of
production. Marx predicted that
as technology improved, it would
lead to increasing unemployment,
alienating more and more people
from the means of production. This
would split society in two, between
the large numbers of impoverished
people and the few who owned and
controlled the means of production.
Following the rules of the dialectic,
this conﬂict would result in a violent
revolution to establish a new,
classless society. This would ❯❯

found expression. Marx saw political
interests and parties as merely
vehicles for the economic interests
of the ruling classes, which were
forced to appear as though they
were acting in the general interest
in order to gain and maintain power.

The road to revolution

be the utopian, conﬂict-free society
that marked the end of the dialectic.
Marx thought this perfect society
would not require government, but
only administration, and this would
be carried out by the leaders of the
revolution: the communist “party”
(by which he means those who
adhered to the cause, rather than
any speciﬁc organization). Within
this new kind of state (which Marx
called the “dictatorship of the
proletariat”) people would enjoy
genuine democracy and social
ownership of wealth. Shortly after
this ﬁnal change in the mode of
production to a perfect society,
Marx predicted, political power as
it had previously been understood
would come to an end, because
there would be no good reason for
political dissent or criminality.

Political power
Marx predicted that the outcome
of the intense class struggles in
Europe between the bourgeoisie

and the wage-earning working
class would become evident only
when the great mass of people had
become property-less and were
obliged to sell their labor for wages.
The juxtaposition of poverty with
the great wealth of the few would
become increasingly obvious, he
thought, and communism would
become increasingly attractive.
However, Marx did not expect
the opponents of communism to
give up their privileges easily. In
every period of history, the ruling
class has enjoyed the advantage of
controlling both the government
and the law as a way of reinforcing
their economic dominance. The
modern state, he said, was actually
a “committee for managing the
affairs of the bourgeois class”, and
struggles by excluded groups to
have their own interests taken into
account—such as the battle to
extend the right to vote—were
simply short-term ways in which the
more fundamental economic conﬂict

Marx’s originality lies in his
combination of pre-existing ideas
rather than the creation of new
ones. His system uses insights from
German idealist philosophers,
especially Georg Hegel and Ludwig
Feuerbach; from French political
theorists, such as Jean-Jacques
Rousseau; and from British political
economists, particularly Adam
Smith. Socialism had become a
recognized political doctrine in the
ﬁrst half of the 19th century, and
from this Marx derives several
insights about property, class,
exploitation, and commercial crises.
Class conﬂict was certainly in
the air when Marx composed the
Manifesto. It was written just

THE AGE OF REVOLUTION 203
against the monarchies of many
continental European countries
broke out in 1848 and 1849. In the
preceding decades, a signiﬁcant
number of people had migrated
from the countryside to the towns
in search of work, although
continental Europe had not yet
seen the industrial development
that had taken place in Britain.
A wave of discontent felt by the
poor against the status quo was
exploited by a variety of liberal
and nationalist politicians, and
revolutions rippled across Europe,
although ultimately these uprisings
were defeated and led to little
permanent change.
However, the Manifesto acquired
an iconic status during the 20th
century, inspiring revolutions in
Russia, China, and many other
countries. The brilliance of Marx’s
theories has been proved wrong in
practice: the extent of repression in
Stalinist Russia, in Mao Zedong’s
China, and in Pol Pot’s Cambodia,
has widely discredited his political
and historical theories.

Criticism of Marxism
Although Marx did not foresee
communism being implemented
in such a barbaric manner in these
primarily agricultural societies, his

ideas are nevertheless still open to
a variety of criticisms. First, Marx
always argued for the inevitability
of revolution. This was the essential
part of the dialectic, but it is clearly
too simplistic, as human creativity
is always able to produce a variety
of choices, and the dialectic fails
to allow for the possibility of
improvement by gradual reform.
Second, Marx tended to invest
the proletariat with wholly good
attributes, and to suggest that a
communist society would give rise
somehow to a new type of human
being. He never explained how
the dictatorship of this perfect
proletariat would be different from
earlier, brutal forms of dictatorship,
nor how it would avoid the
corrupting effects of power.
Third, Marx rarely discussed
the possibility that new threats
to liberty might emerge after a
successful revolution; he assumed
that poverty was the only real cause
of criminality. His critics have also
alleged that he did not sufﬁciently
understand the forces of nationalism,
and that he gave no proper account
of the role of personal leadership in
politics. In fact, the 20th-century
communist movement was to
produce immensely powerful
personality cults in virtually every
country in which communists
came to power.

Lasting inﬂuence

Marxist states of the 20th century
promoted themselves as utopias. They
produced a proliferation of paintings
and statues glorifying the achievements
of their happy, newly liberated citizens.

Despite the criticism and crises that
Marx’s theories have provoked, his
ideas have been hugely inﬂuential.
As a powerful critic of commercial
capitalism, and as an economic
and socialist theorist, Marx is still
considered relevant to politics and
economics today. Many would
agree with the 20th-century
Russian-British philosopher, Isaiah
Berlin, that the The Communist
Manifesto is “a work of genius.” ■

Karl Marx
The most famous revolutionary
thinker of the 19th century
was born in the German city
of Trier. The son of a Jewish
lawyer who had converted to
Christianity, Marx studied law
at Bonn University, where he
met his future wife, Jenny von
Westphalen. He then studied
at the University of Berlin,
before working as a journalist.
The favor he bestowed on
democracy in his writing led
to censorship by the Prussian
royal family, and he was forced
into exile in France and
Belgium. During this time he
developed a unique theory of
communism in collaboration
with his German compatriot
Friedrich Engels.
Marx returned to Germany
during the 1848–49 revolutions,
but after they were quashed
he lived in exile in London for
the rest of his life. He and his
wife lived in extreme poverty,
and when Marx died stateless
at the age of 64, there were
only 11 mourners at his funeral.

Henry Thoreau developed the idea
further, arguing that “all good
things are wild and free”, and that
the laws of man suppress rather

saw that political parties were
necessarily one-sided, and that
their policies often ran contrary to
our moral beliefs. For this reason,
he believed it was the individual’s
duty to protest against unjust laws,
and argued that passively allowing
such laws to be enacted effectively
gave them justiﬁcation. “Any fool

C

harles Sanders Peirce was
the scientist, logician, and
philosopher of science
who pioneered the philosophical
movement known as pragmatism.
Deeply sceptical of metaphysical
ideas—such as the idea that there
is a “real” world beyond the world
we experience—he once asked his
readers to consider what is wrong
with the following theory: a
diamond is actually soft, and only
becomes hard when it is touched.
Peirce argued that there is “no
falsity” in such thinking, for there
is no way of disproving it. However,
he claimed that the meaning of a
concept (such as “diamond” or
“hard”) is derived from the object
or quality that the concept relates
to—and the effects it has on our
senses. Whether we think of the
diamond as “soft until touched” or
“always hard” before our experience,
therefore, is irrelevant. Under both
theories the diamond feels the
same, and can be used in exactly
the same way. However, the ﬁrst
theory is far more difﬁcult to work
with, and so is of less value to us.

This idea, that the meaning of a
concept is the sensory effect of its
object, is known as the pragmatic
maxim, and it became the founding
principle of pragmatism—the belief
that the “truth” is the account of
reality that works best for us.
One of the key things Peirce
was trying to accomplish was to
show that many debates in science,
philosophy, and theology are
meaningless. He claimed that they
are often debates about words,
rather than reality, because they
are debates in which no effect on
the senses can be speciﬁed. ■

science; nothing can be.

William James—godson to Ralph
Emerson—to champion Peirce’s
ideas and develop them further.

Truth and usefulness
Central to Peirce’s pragmatism was
the theory that we do not acquire
knowledge simply by observing,
but by doing, and that we rely on
that knowledge only so long as it is
useful, in the sense that it adequately
explains things for us. When it no
longer fulﬁls that function, or better
explanations make it redundant, we
replace it. For example, we can see
by looking back in history how our

ideas about the world have changed
constantly, from thinking that Earth
is ﬂat to knowing it to be round; from
assuming that Earth is the center of
the universe, to realizing that it is
just one planet in a vast cosmos. The
older assumptions worked perfectly
adequately as explanations in their
time, yet they are not true, and the
universe itself has not changed.
This demonstrates how knowledge
as an explanatory tool is different
from facts. Peirce examined the
nature of knowledge in this way,
but James was to apply this
reasoning to the notion of truth. ❯❯

Every way of
classifying a thing
is but a way of
handling it for some
particular purpose.

208 WILLIAM JAMES
The idea of a ﬂat Earth served well
as a “truth” for several thousand years,
despite the fact that Earth is a sphere.
James claims that an idea’s usefulness
determines its truthfulness.

For James, the truth of an idea
depends on how useful it is; that is
to say, whether or not it does what
is required of it. If an idea does not
contradict the known facts—such
as laws of science—and it does
provide a means of predicting
things accurately enough for our
purposes, he says there can be no
reason not to consider it true, in the
same way that Peirce considered
knowledge as a useful tool

William James

irrespective of the facts. This
interpretation of truth not only
distinguishes it from fact, but also
leads James to propose that “the
truth of an idea is not a stagnant
property inherent in it. Truth
happens to an idea. It becomes
true, is made true by events. Its
verity is in fact an event, a process.”
Any idea, if acted upon, is found to
be true by the action we take;
putting the idea into practice is the
Born in New York City, William
James was brought up in a
wealthy and intellectual family;
his father was a famously eccentric
theologian, and his brother Henry
became a well-known author.
During his childhood he lived for
several years in Europe, where he
pursued a love of painting, but at
the age of 19 he abandoned this
to study science. His studies at
Harvard Medical School were
interrupted by the ill health and
depression that were to prevent
him from ever practicing medicine,
but he eventually graduated and
in 1872 took a teaching post in

process by which it becomes true.
James also thinks that belief in
an idea is an important factor in
choosing to act upon it, and in this
way belief is a part of the process
that makes an idea true. If I am
faced with a difﬁcult decision, my
belief in a particular idea will lead
to a particular course of action and
so contribute to its success. It is
because of this that James deﬁnes
“true beliefs” as those that prove
useful to the believer. Again, he is
careful to distinguish these from
facts, which he says “are not true.
They simply are. Truth is the
function of the beliefs that start
and terminate among them.”

The right to believe
Every time we try to establish a
new belief, it would be useful if we
had all the available evidence and
the time to make a considered
decision. But in much of life we do
not have that luxury; either there
is not enough time to examine the
physiology at Harvard University.
His increasing interest in the
subjects of psychology and
philosophy led him to write
acclaimed publications in these
ﬁelds, and he was awarded
a professorship in philosophy
at Harvard in 1880. He taught
there until his retirement in 1907.

known facts, or there is not enough
evidence, and we are forced to a
decision. We have to rely on our
beliefs to guide our actions, and
James says that we have “the right
to believe” in these cases.
James explains this by taking
the example of a man lost and
starving in a forest. When he sees a
path, it is important for him to believe
that the path will lead him out of the
forest and to habitation, because if
he does not believe it, he will not
take the path, and will remain lost
and starving. But if he does, he will
save himself. By acting on his idea
that the path will lead him to safety,
it becomes true. In this way our
actions and decisions make our
belief in an idea become true. This
is why James asserts “act as if what
you do makes a difference”—to
which he adds the typically concise
and good-humored rider, “it does.”
We must, however, approach
this idea with caution: a shallow

such as the healing of the sick at places
of pilgrimage. This occurs regardless
of whether or not a god actually exists.

interpretation of what James is
saying could give the impression
that any belief, no matter how
outlandish, could become true by
acting upon it—which of course
is not what he meant. There are
certain conditions that an idea
must fulﬁl before it can be
considered a justiﬁable belief. The
available evidence must weigh in
its favor, and the idea must be
sufﬁcient to withstand criticism.
In the process of acting upon the
belief, it must continually justify
itself by its usefulness in increasing
our understanding or predicting
results. And even then, it is only in
retrospect that we can safely say
that the belief has become true
through our acting upon it.

Reality as a process
James was a psychologist as well
as a philosopher, and he sees the
implications of his ideas in terms
of human psychology as much as
in the theory of knowledge. He
recognized the psychological
necessity for humans to hold certain
beliefs, particularly religious ones.
James thinks that while it is not
justiﬁable as a fact, belief in a god is
useful to its believer if it allows him
or her to lead a more fulﬁlled life, or
to overcome the fear of death. These
things—a more fulﬁlled life and a
fearless confrontation of death—
become true; they happen as the
result of a belief, and the decisions
and actions based upon it.
Along with his pragmatic notion
of truth, James proposes a type of
metaphysics that he calls “radical
empiricism.” This approach takes
reality to be a dynamic, active
process, in the same way that truth
is a process. Like the traditional
empiricists before him, James
rejected the rationalist notion that
the changing world is in some way
unreal, but he also went further to

The pragmatic method

principles and looking
towards consequences.

state that “for pragmatism, [reality]
is still in the making”, as truth is
constantly being made to happen.
This “stream” of reality, he believes,
is not susceptible to empirical
analysis either, both because it is
in continual ﬂux and because the
act of observing it affects the truth
of the analysis. In James’s radical
empiricism, from which both mind
and matter are formed, the ultimate
stuff of reality is pure experience.

Continuing inﬂuence
Pragmatism, proposed by Peirce and
expounded by James, established
America as a signiﬁcant center
for philosophical thought in the
20th century. James’s pragmatic
interpretation of truth inﬂuenced
the philosophy of John Dewey, and
spawned a “neopragmatist” school
of thought in America that includes
philosophers such as Richard Rorty.
In Europe, Bertrand Russell and
Ludwig Wittgenstein were indebted
to James’s metaphysics. His
work in psychology was equally
inﬂuential, and often intimately
connected with his philosophy,
notably his concept of the “stream
of consciousness”, which in turn
inﬂuenced writers such as Virginia
Woolf and James Joyce. ■

oward the end of the
19th century, philosophy
once again reached a
turning point. Science, and
particularly Charles Darwin’s
theory of evolution (1859), had
thrown into doubt the idea of the
universe as God’s creation, with
humankind as the peak of his
creative genius. Moral and political
philosophy had become entirely
human-centered, with Karl Marx
declaring religion “the opiate of the
people.” Following in the footsteps
of Arthur Schopenhauer, Friedrich
Nietzsche believed that Western
philosophy, with its roots in Greek
and Judaeo-Christian traditions,
was ill-equipped to explain this
modern world view. He proposed
a radical new approach to ﬁnding
meaning in life, one that involved
casting aside old values and

traditions. In doing so, he set the
agenda for much of the philosophy
of the 20th century.

A new analytical tradition
To some extent, the traditional
concerns of philosophy—such as
asking what exists—were answered
by science in the early 20th century.
Albert Einstein’s theories offered
a more detailed explanation of the
nature of the universe, and Sigmund
Freud’s psychoanalytic theories
gave people a radically new insight
into the workings of the mind.
As a result, philosophers turned
their attention to questions of
moral and political philosophy or,
since philosophy had become the
province of professional academics,
to the more abstract business of
logic and linguistic analysis. At the
vanguard of this movement of logical

analysis—which became known
as analytic philosophy—was the
work of Gottlob Frege, who linked
the philosophical process of logic
with mathematics. His ideas
were enthusiastically received
by a British philosopher and
mathematician, Bertrand Russell.
Russell applied the principles
of logic that Frege had outlined to
a thorough analysis of mathematics
in the Principia Mathematica,
which he wrote with Alfred North
Whitehead, and then—in a move
that revolutionized philosophical
thinking—he applied the same
principles to language. The process
of linguistic analysis was to
become the major theme in
20th century British philosophy.
One of Russell’s pupils, Ludwig
Wittgenstein, developed Russell’s
work on logic and language, but

also made key contributions in
areas as diverse as perception,
ethics, and aesthetics, becoming
one of the greatest thinkers of the
20th century. Another, slightly
younger Viennese philosopher, Karl
Popper, took his cue from Einstein,
and strengthened the link between
scientiﬁc thinking and philosophy.
Meanwhile, in Germany,
philosophers rose to the challenge
posed by Nietzsche’s ideas with a
philosophy based on the experience
of the individual in a godless
universe: existentialism. Edmund
Husserl’s phenomenology (the study
of experience) laid the groundwork,
and this was carried forward by
Martin Heidegger, who was also
greatly inﬂuenced by the Danish
philosopher, Søren Kierkegaard.
Heidegger’s work, produced in the
1920s and 30s, was largely rejected

in the mid-20th century due to his
connections with the Nazi party
during World War II, but his works
were key to the development of
existentialism, and were important
to late 20th-century culture.

Wars and revolutions
Philosophy was as affected by the
massive political upheavals of the
20th century as any other cultural
activity, but it also contributed to
the ideologies that shaped the
modern world. The revolution that
formed the Soviet Union in the
1920s had its roots in Marxism, a
19th-century political philosophy.
This theory became more prevalent
globally than any single religion,
dominating the policy of China’s
Communist Party until around
1982, and replacing traditional
philosophies across Asia.

Liberal democracies in Europe
during the 1930s were threatened
by fascism, forcing many thinkers
to ﬂee from the continent to Britain
and the US. Philosophers turned
their attention to left-wing or liberal
politics in reaction to the oppression
they experienced under totalitarian
regimes. World War II and the Cold
War that followed it colored the
moral philosophy of the second
half of the 20th century.
In France, existentialism was
made fashionable by Jean-Paul
Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, and
Albert Camus, who were all
novelists. This trend was in keeping
with the French view of philosophy
as part of an essentially literary
culture. It was also fundamental
to the direction that continental
philosophy was to take in the last
decades of the 20th century. ■

with a fourth part added in 1885.
The German philosopher used it

He targets three linked ideas in

these three things. He does so in a
style that is astonishingly hot-headed

So he decides to descend to the
market place to share this wisdom
with the rest of humankind.
On the way down to the town,
at the foot of the hill, he meets with
an old hermit. The two men have
already met, ten years before, when

the mountain, the hermit says,

as he descends, he is carrying ﬁre.
Then the hermit asks Zarathustra
a question: why are you going to
the trouble of sharing your wisdom?
He advises Zarathustra to stay in
the mountains, warning him that
nobody will understand his
message. Zarathustra then asks a
question: what does the hermit do
in the mountains? The hermit
replies that he sings, weeps, laughs,
mumbles, and praises God. On
hearing this, Zarathustra himself
laughs. Then he wishes the hermit
well and continues on his way
down the mountain. As he goes,

Behold the Superman
The idea of the death of God may
be the most famous of all Nietzsche’s
ideas, and it is closely related both
to the idea that man is something
to be surpassed and to Nietzsche’s
distinctive understanding of
morality. The relationship between
these things becomes clear as the
story continues.
When he reaches the town,
Zarathustra sees that there is a
crowd gathered around a tightrope
walker who is about to perform,
and he joins them. Before the
acrobat has a chance to walk across
his rope, Zarathustra stands up. It
is at this point that he says, “Behold!
I teach you the Superman!” He
continues by telling the crowd the
real point he wishes to convey:
“Man is something to surpassed...”.

just another showman, or perhaps
even a warm-up performer for the
tightrope-walker.
In opening his book in this
unusual way, Nietzsche seems to
be betraying his own unease with
the reception that his philosophy
will receive, as if he is afraid that he
will be seen as a philosophical
showman without anything real
to say. If we want to avoid making
the same mistake as the crowd
gathered around Zarathustra, and
actually understand what Nietzsche
is saying, it is necessary to explore
some of Nietzsche’s core beliefs.

Overturning old values
Nietzsche believes that certain
concepts have become inextricably
entangled: humankind, morality,
and God. When his character
Zarathustra says that God is dead,
he is not simply launching an
attack upon religion, but doing
something much bolder. “God” here
does not only mean the god that
philosophers talk about or the
religious pray to; it means the sum

total of the higher values that we
might hold. The death of God is not
just the death of a deity; it is also
the death of all the so-called higher
values that we have inherited.
One of the central purposes of
Nietzsche’s philosophy is what he
calls the “revaluation of all values”,
an attempt to call into question all
of the ways that we are accustomed
to thinking about ethics and the
meanings and purposes of life.
Nietzsche repeatedly maintains
that in doing so he is setting out a
philosophy of cheerfulness, which,
although it overturns everything we
have thought up until now about
good and evil, nevertheless seeks to
afﬁrm life. He claims that many of
the things that we think are “good”
are, in fact, ways of limiting, or of
turning away from, life.
We may think it is not “good” to
make a fool of ourselves in public,
and so resist the urge to dance
joyfully in the street. We may
believe that the desires of the ﬂesh
are sinful, and so punish ourselves
when they arise. We may stay in

mind-numbing jobs, not because
we need to, but because we feel it is
our duty to do so. Nietzsche wants
to put an end to such life-denying
philosophies, so that humankind
can see itself in a different way.

Blaspheming against life
After Zarathustra proclaims the
coming of the Superman, he swiftly
moves to condemn religion. In the
past, he says, the greatest blasphemy
was to blaspheme against God; but
now the greatest blasphemy is to
blaspheme against life itself. This is
the error that Zarathustra believes
he made upon the hillside: in turning
away from the world, and in offering
up prayers to a God who is not
there, he was sinning against life.
The history behind this death
of God, or loss of faith in our higher
values, is told in Nietzsche’s essay,
How the “Real World” at last Became
a Myth, which was published in
Twilight of the Idols. The essay
carries the subtitle “History of an
Error”, and it is an extraordinarily
condensed one-page history of

Western philosophy. The story
begins, Nietzsche says, with the
Greek philosopher Plato.

Some religions and philosophies insist that a more
important “real world” exists elsewhere. Nietzsche sees
this as a myth that tragically prevents us from living
fully now, in this world.

The real world
Plato divided the world into an
“apparent” world that appears to
us through our senses, and a “real”
world that we can grasp through
the intellect. For Plato, the world
we perceive through the senses is
not “real” because it is changeable
and subject to decay. Plato suggests
that there is also an unchanging,
permanent “real world” that can
be attained with the help of the
intellect. This idea comes from
Plato’s study of mathematics.
The form or idea of a triangle, for
example, is eternal and can be
grasped by the intellect. We know
that a triangle is a three-sided,
two-dimensional ﬁgure whose
angles add up to 180º, and that

because, as Nietzsche points out,
this way of dividing up the world
makes the “real world” of the
intellect the place where everything

makes the “apparent world” of the
senses a world that is, relatively
speaking, unimportant.

Christian values
Nietzsche traces the fortunes of
this tendency to split the world into
two and ﬁnds that the same idea
appears within Christian thought.
In place of the “real world” of Plato’s
Forms, Christianity substitutes an
alternative “real world”; a future world
of heaven that is promised to the
virtuous. Nietzsche believes that

Christianity views the world we live
in now as somehow less real than
heaven, but in this version of the
“two worlds” idea the “real world” is
attainable, albeit after death and on
condition that we follow Christian
rules in this life. The present world
is devalued, as it is with Plato, except
insofar as it acts as a stepping stone
to the world beyond. Nietzsche
claims that Christianity asks us to
deny the present life in favor of the
promise of a life to come.

versions of the idea that the world

wise or the virtuous, in this world or
the next—then it is “an idea grown
useless, superﬂuous.” As a result, it
is an idea that we need to do away
with. If God is dead, Nietzsche is
perhaps the person who stumbles
across the corpse; nevertheless, it
is Kant whose ﬁngerprints are all
over the murder weapon.

Philosophy’s longest error

everything of value in the world is
somehow “beyond” the reach of this
world leads to a way of thinking
that is fundamentally life-denying.
As a result of this Platonic and
Christian heritage, we have come
to see the world we live in as a
world that we should resent and
disdain, a world from which we
should turn away, transcend, and
certainly not enjoy. But in doing so,
we have turned away from life itself
in favor of a myth or an invention,
an imagined “real world” that is
situated elsewhere. Nietzsche calls
priests of all religions “preachers of
death”, because their teachings
encourage us to turn from this
world, and from life to death. But
why does Nietzsche insist that God
is dead? To answer this, we must

look to the work of the 18th-century
German philosopher Immanuel
Kant, whose ideas are critical to
understanding the philosophy
behind Nietzsche’s work.

A world beyond reach
Kant was interested in the limits
of knowledge. In his book Critique
of Pure Reason, he argued that we
cannot know the world as it is “in
itself.” We cannot attain it with the
intellect, as Plato believed; nor is it
promised to us after death as in
the Christian view. It exists (we
assume), but it is forever out of
reach. The reasons that Kant uses
to come up with this conclusion are
complex, but what is important
from Nietzsche’s point of view is
that, if the real world is said to be

Once we have dispensed with the
idea of the “real world”, the longheld distinction between the “real
world” and the “apparent world”
begins to break down. In How the
“Real World” at last Became a Myth,
Nietzsche goes on to explain this
as follows: “We have abolished the
real world; what world is left? The
apparent world, perhaps? … But
no! With the real world we have
also abolished the apparent world.”
Nietzsche now sees the beginning
of the end of philosophy’s “longest
error”: its infatuation with the
distinction between “appearance”
and “reality”, and the idea of two
worlds. The end of this error,
Nietzsche writes, is the zenith of
mankind—the high point of all
humanity. It is at this point—in an
essay written six years after Thus
Spake Zarathustra—that Nietzsche
writes “Zarathustra begins.”
This is a key moment for
Nietzsche because when we grasp
the fact that there is only one world,
we suddenly see the error that had
put all values beyond this world.
We are then forced to reconsider
all our values and even what it
means to be human. And when we
see through these philosophical

THE MODERN WORLD 221
illusions, the old idea of “man” can
be surpassed. The Superman is
Nietzsche’s vision of a fundamentally
life-afﬁrming way of being. It is one
that can become the bearer of
meaning not in the world beyond,
but here; Superman is “the
meaning of the Earth.”

Creating ourselves
Nietzsche’s writings did not reach
a large audience in his lifetime, so
much so that he had to pay for the
publication of the ﬁnal part of Thus
Spoke Zarathustra himself. But
around 30 years after his death in
1900, the idea of the Superman fed
into the rhetoric of Nazism through
Hitler’s readings of Nietzsche’s
work. Nietzsche’s ideas about the
Superman, and particularly his call
for an eradication of the JewishChristian morality that held sway
throughout Europe would have been
attractive to Hitler as validation for
his own aims. But where Nietzsche
seemed to be searching for a return
to the more rustic, life-afﬁrming
values of pagan Europe, Hitler

took his writings as an excuse for
unbridled violence and transgression
on a grand scale. The consensus
amongst scholars is that Nietzsche
himself would have been horriﬁed
by this turn of events. Writing in
an era of extraordinary nationalism,
patriotism, and colonial expansion,
Nietzsche was one of the few
thinkers to call these assumptions
into question. At one point in Thus
Spoke Zarathustra he makes it
clear that he considers nationalism
a form of alienation or failure. “Only
where the state ends,” Zarathustra
says, “there begins the human
being who is not superﬂuous”.
Nietzsche’s open-ended idea of
human possibility was important
to many philosophers in the period
following World War II. His ideas
about religion and the importance
of self-evaluation can be traced
especially in the work of succeeding
existentialists such as the French
philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre. Like
Nietzsche’s Superman, Sartre says
that we must each deﬁne the
meaning of our own existence.

The degree of
introspection achieved by
Nietzsche had never been
achieved by anyone.

Nietzsche’s damning criticisms of
the Western philosophical tradition
have had a huge impact not only on
philosophy, but also on European
and world culture, and they went

Ha’am was fond of quoting an
old Yiddish proverb: “an act of folly
which turns out well is still an act
of folly.” On some occasions we act
foolishly, without fully understanding
the difﬁculties of the task we are
undertaking, but we win through
because luck is on our side.
However, says Ha’am, this does
not make our prior foolishness in
any way commendable.
If we want our actions to bring
results, it may indeed be the case
that we need to develop and use
the kind of self-conﬁdence that can
occasionally be seen in acts of folly.
At the same time, we must always
temper this self-conﬁdence with

John Poinsot writes his

inﬂuences Noam Chomsky’s

which aims to expose the rules
of a language that govern its

the literary implications of
signs and semiotics.

S

aussure was a 19th-century
Swiss philosopher who saw
language as made up of
systems of “signs”, with the signs
acting as the basic units of the
language. His studies formed the
basis of a new theory, known as
semiotics. This new theory of signs
was developed by other philosophers
during the 20th century such as
Russia’s Roman Jakobson, who
summed up the semiotic approach
when he said that “every message
is made of signs.”
Saussure said that a sign is made
up of two things. Firstly, a “signiﬁer”,
which is a sound-image. This is not
the actual sound, but the mental
“image” we have of the sound.
Secondly, the “signiﬁed”, or concept.
Here Saussure turns his back on a
long tradition that says language is
about the relationships between
words and things, because he is
saying that both aspects of a sign
are mental (our concept of a “dog”
for example, and a sound-image of
the sound “dog”). Saussure claims
that any message—for example
“my dog is called Fred”—is a system

of signs. This means that it is a
system of relationships between
sound-images and concepts.
However, Saussure states that the
relationship between the signiﬁed
and the signiﬁer is arbitrary—so
there is nothing particularly
“doggy” about the sound “dog”,
which is why the word can be
chien in French, or gou in Chinese.
Saussure’s work on language
became the basis of modern
linguistics, and inﬂuenced many
philosophers and literary theorists. ■

EXPERIENCE
BY ITSELF IS
NOT SCIENCE
EDMUND HUSSERL (1859–1938)

IN CONTEXT

Ontology

Science aspires to
certainty about the world.

APPROACH
Phenomenology
BEFORE
5th century BCE Socrates
uses argument to try to
answer philosophical
questions with certainty.
17th century René Descartes
uses doubt as a starting point
for his philosophical method.

But science is empirical:
it depends upon
experience.

1874 Franz Brentano, Husserl’s
teacher, claims that philosophy
needs a new scientiﬁc method.
AFTER
From 1920s Martin
Heidegger, Husserl’s student,
develops his teacher’s method
of phenomenology, leading to
the birth of existentialism.
From 1930s Husserl’s
phenomenology reaches
France, inﬂuencing thinkers
such as Emmanuel Levinas
and Maurice Merleau-Ponty.

H

usserl was a philosopher
haunted by a dream that
has preoccupied thinkers
since the time of the ancient
Greek philosopher Socrates: the
dream of certainty. For Socrates,
the problem was this: although we
easily reach agreement on questions
about things we can measure (for
example, “how many olives are
there in this jar?”), when it comes
to philosophical questions such
as “what is justice?” or “what is
beauty?”, it seems that there is no
clear way of reaching agreement.
And if we cannot know for certain
what justice is, then how can we
say anything about it at all?

The problem of certainty
Experience is subject to
assumptions and biases.

So experience
by itself is
not science.

Husserl was a philosopher who
started life as a mathematician.
He dreamed that problems such as
“what is justice?” might be solved
with the same degree of certainty
with which we are able to solve
mathematical problems such as
“how many olives are in the jar?” In
other words, he hoped to put all the
sciences—by which he meant all
branches of human knowledge and
activity, from math, chemistry,
and physics to ethics and politics –
on a completely secure footing.

Scientiﬁc theories are based on
experience. But Husserl believed
that experience alone did not add
up to science, because as any
scientist knows, experience is full
of all kinds of assumptions, biases,
and misconceptions. Husserl
wanted to drive out all of these
uncertainties to give science
absolutely certain foundations.
To do this, Husserl made use of
the philosophy of the 19th-century
philosopher René Descartes. Like
Husserl, Descartes wanted to free
philosophy from all assumptions,
biases, and doubts. Descartes wrote
that although almost everything
could be doubted, he could not
doubt that he was doubting.

Phenomenology
Husserl takes up a similar approach
to Descartes, but uses it differently.
He suggests that if we adopt a
scientiﬁc attitude to experience,
laying aside every single assumption
that we have (even including the
assumption that an external world
exists outside of us), then we can

Mathematics does not rely on
empirical evidence, which is full of
assumptions, to reach its conclusions.
Husserl wanted to put all science (and
all knowledge) on a similar foundation.

human community.

start philosophy with a clean slate,
free of all assumptions. Husserl
calls this approach phenomenology:
a philosophical investigation of
the phenomena of experience. We
need to look at experience with a
scientiﬁc attitude, laying to one
side (or “bracketing out” as Husserl
calls it) every single one of our
assumptions. And if we look
carefully and patiently enough, we
can build a secure foundation of
knowledge that might help us deal
with the philosophical problems
that have been with us since the
very beginnings of philosophy.
However, different philosophers
following Husserl’s method came
to different results, and there was
little agreement as to what the
method actually was, or how one
carried it out. Toward the end of his
career, Husserl wrote that the
dream of putting the sciences on
ﬁrm foundations was over. But
although Husserl’s phenomenology
failed to provide philosophers with
a scientiﬁc approach to experience,
or to solve philosophy’s most
enduring problems, it nevertheless
gave birth to one of the richest
traditions in 20th-century thought. ■

Edmund Husserl
Husserl was born in 1859
in Moravia, then a part of
the Austrian empire. He
started his career studying
mathematics and astronomy,
but after ﬁnishing his
doctorate in mathematics he
decided to take up philosophy.
In 1887 Husserl married
Malvine Steinschneider, with
whom he had three children.
He also became Privatdozent
(private lecturer) at Halle,
where he remained until 1901.
He then accepted an associate
professorship at the University
of Göttingen, before becoming
a professor of philosophy at
the University of Freiburg in
1916, where Martin Heidegger
was among his students. In
1933, Husserl was suspended
from the university on account
of his Jewish background, a
decision in which Heidegger
was implicated. Husserl
continued to write until his
death in 1938.

his vitalism, or theory of
life. In it, Bergson wanted to discover
whether it is possible to really know
something—not just to know about
it, but to know it as it actually is.
Ever since the philosopher
Immanuel Kant published The
Critique of Pure Reason in 1781,
many philosophers have claimed
that it is impossible for us to know
things as they actually are. This is
because Kant showed that we can
know how things are relative to we
ourselves, given the kinds of minds
we have; but we can never step
outside of ourselves to achieve an
absolute view of the world’s actual
“things-in-themselves.”

Two forms of knowledge
Bergson, however, does not agree
with Kant. He says that there are
two different kinds of knowledge:
relative knowledge, which involves
knowing something from our own
unique particular perspective;
and absolute knowledge, which is
knowing things as they actually

are. Bergson believes that these are
reached by different methods, the
ﬁrst through analysis or intellect,
and the second through intuition.
Kant’s mistake, Bergson believes,
is that he does not recognize the
full importance of our faculty of
intuition, which allows us to grasp
an object’s uniqueness through
direct connection. Our intuition is
linked to what Bergson called our
élan vital, a life-force (vitalism) that
interprets the ﬂux of experience in
terms of time rather than space.
Suppose you want to get to know
a city, he says. You could compile a
record of it by taking photographs
of every part, from every possible
perspective, before reconstructing
these images to give some idea of
the city as a whole. But you would
be grasping it at one remove, not as
a living city. If, on the other hand,
you were simply to stroll around the
streets, paying attention in the right
way, you might acquire knowledge
of the city itself—a direct knowledge
of the city as it actually is. This
direct knowledge, for Bergson, is
knowledge of the essence of the city.
Henri Bergson was one of the most
inﬂuential French philosophers
of his time. Born in France in 1859,
he was the son of an English
mother and a Polish father. His
early intellectual interests lay in
mathematics, at which he excelled.
Despite this, he took up philosophy
as a career, initially teaching in
schools. When his book Matter

Capturing the essence of a city,
person, or object may only be possible
through direct knowledge gained from
intuition, not analysis. Bergson says we
underestimate the value of our intuition.

But how do we practice intuition?
Essentially, it is a matter of seeing
the world in terms of our sense of
unfolding time. While walking
through the city, we have a sense
of our own inner time, and we also
have an inner sense of the various
unfolding times of the city through
which we are walking. As these
times overlap, Bergson believes that
we can make a direct connection

are the practical implications of
adopting this perspective?”
For Dewey, philosophical
problems are not abstract problems
divorced from people’s lives. He
sees them as problems that occur
because humans are living beings
trying to make sense of their
world, struggling to decide how
best to act within it. Philosophy
starts from our everyday human
hopes and aspirations, and from
the problems that arise in the
course of our lives. This being the
case, Dewey thinks that philosophy
should also be a way of ﬁnding

practical responses to these
problems. He believes that
philosophizing is not about being
a “spectator” who looks at the
world from afar, but about actively
engaging in the problems of life.

Dewey was strongly inﬂuenced

as living creatures who are a part

John Dewey was born in

before returning to undertake
further study in psychology
and philosophy. He taught at
various leading universities for
the remainder of his life, and
wrote extensively on a broad

put into practice his
educational philosophy of
learning by doing. This
institution is still running

environments. For Dewey, one of
the implications of Darwin’s
thought is that it requires us to
think of human beings not as ﬁxed
essences created by God, but
instead as natural beings. We are
not souls who belong in some other,
non-material world, but evolved
organisms who are trying to do our
best to survive in a world of which
we are inescapably a part.

Everything changes
Dewey also takes from Darwin the
idea that nature as a whole is a
system that is in a constant state of
change; an idea that itself echoes
the philosophy of the ancient Greek
philosopher Heraclitus. When
Dewey comes to think about what
philosophical problems are, and
how they arise, he takes this
insight as a starting point.
Dewey discusses the idea that
we only think when confronted
with problems in an essay entitled
Kant and the Philosophic Method
(1884). We are, he says, organisms
that ﬁnd ourselves having to respond
to a world that is subject to constant
change and ﬂux. Existence is a
risk, or a gamble, and the world
is fundamentally unstable. We
depend upon our environment to
be able to survive and thrive, but

the many environments in which
we ﬁnd ourselves are themselves
always changing. Not only this, but
these environments do not change
in a predictable fashion. For several
years there may be a good crop of
wheat, for instance, but then the
harvest fails. A sailor may set sail
under ﬁne weather, only to ﬁnd that
a storm suddenly blows up out of
nowhere. We are healthy for years,
and then disease strikes us when
we least expect it.
In the face of this uncertainty,
Dewey says that there are two
different strategies we can adopt.
We can either appeal to higher
beings and hidden forces in the
universe for help, or we can seek
to understand the world and gain
control of our environment.

Appeasing the gods
The ﬁrst of these strategies involves
attempting to affect the world by
means of magical rites, ceremonies,
and sacriﬁces. This approach to the
uncertainty of the world, Dewey
believes, forms the basis of both
religion and ethics.
In the story that Dewey tells,
our ancestors worshipped gods and
spirits as a way of trying to ally
themselves with the “powers that
dispense fortune.” This scenario is
played out in stories from around the
world, in myths and legends such as
those about unfortunate seafarers
who pray to gods or saints to calm
the storm, and thereby survive. In
the same way, Dewey believes,
ethics arises out of the attempts
our ancestors made to appease
hidden forces; but where they made
sacriﬁces, we strike bargains with
the gods, promising to be good if
they spare us from harm.
The alternative response to the
uncertainties of our changing world
is to develop various techniques of
mastering the world, so that we

way to ask for help from the gods, but

up a silent promise to be good in return

can live in it more easily. We can
learn the art of forecasting the
weather, and build houses to
shelter ourselves from its extremes,
and so on. Rather than attempting
to ally ourselves with the hidden
powers of the universe, this
strategy involves ﬁnding ways of
revealing how our environment
works, and then working out how
to transform it to our beneﬁt.
Dewey points out that it is
important to realize that we can
never completely control our
environment or transform it to
such an extent that we can drive
out all uncertainty. At best, he
says, we can modify the risky,
uncertain nature of the world in
which we ﬁnd ourselves. But life
is inescapably risky.

A luminous philosophy
For much of human history, Dewey
writes, these two approaches to
dealing with the riskiness of life
have existed in tension with each
other, and they have given rise to
two different kinds of knowledge:

THE MODERN WORLD 231
Scientiﬁc experiments, such as those
performed by Benjamin Franklin in the
1740s, help us gain control over the
world. Dewey thought philosophical
theories should be equally useful.

He is critical of any philosophical
approaches that ultimately make
our experience more puzzling,
or the world more mysterious.
Second, he thinks we should judge
a philosophical theory by asking
to what extent it succeeds in
addressing the problems of living.
Is it useful to us, in our everyday
lives? Does it, for instance, “yield
the enrichment and increase of
power” that we have come to
expect from new scientiﬁc theories?

A practical inﬂuence

on the one hand, ethics and religion;
and on the other hand, arts and
technologies. Or, more simply,
tradition and science. Philosophy,
in Dewey’s view, is the process by
means of which we try to work
through the contradictions between
these two different kinds of
response to the problems in our
lives. These contradictions are not
just theoretical; they are also
practical. For example, I may have
inherited innumerable traditional
beliefs about ethics, meaning, and
what constitutes a “good life”, but
I may ﬁnd that these beliefs are in
tension with the knowledge and
understanding that I have gained

from studying the sciences. In this
context philosophy can be seen as
the art of ﬁnding both theoretical
and practical responses to these
problems and contradictions.
There are two ways in which to
judge whether a form of philosophy
is successful. First, we should ask
whether it has made the world
more intelligible. Does this
particular philosophical theory
make our experience “more
luminous”, Dewey asks, or does it
make it “more opaque”? Here
Dewey is agreeing with Peirce that
philosophy’s purpose is to make our
ideas and our everyday experience
clearer and easier to understand.

A number of philosophers, such as
Bertrand Russell, have criticized
pragmatism by claiming that it
has simply given up on the long
philosophical quest for truth.
Nevertheless, Dewey’s philosophy
has been enormously inﬂuential in
America. Given that Dewey places
such an overriding emphasis on
responding to the practical problems
of life, it is perhaps unsurprising
that much of his inﬂuence has been
in practical realms, such as in
education and in politics. ■

how there can be suffering in

all-powerful God.
AFTER
1940 The Irish author and

his book The Problem of Pain.
20th century Unamuno’s
philosophy of suffering
inﬂuences other Spanish
writers such as Federico
García Lorca and Juan Ramón
Jiménez, and the British author
Graham Greene.

T

he Spanish philosopher,
novelist, and poet, Miguel
de Unamuno, is perhaps
best known for his book The Tragic
Sense of Life (1913). In this he
writes that all consciousness is
consciousness of death (we are
painfully aware of our lack of
immortality) and of suffering.
What makes us human is the
fact that we suffer.
At ﬁrst glance, it may seem
as if this idea is close to that of
Sidhartha Gautama, the Buddha,
who also said that suffering is an
inescapable part of all human life.
But Unamuno’s response to suffering
is very different. Unlike the Buddha,
Unamuno does not see suffering as
a problem to be overcome through
practicing detachment. Instead he
argues that suffering is an essential
part of what it means to exist as a
human being, and a vital experience.
If all consciousness amounts to
consciousness of human mortality
and suffering, as Unamuno claims,
and if consciousness is what
makes us distinctively human,
then the only way we can lend

our lives a kind of weight and
substance is to embrace this
suffering. If we turn away from
it, we are not only turning away
from what makes us human, we
are also turning away from
consciousness itself.

Love or happiness
There is also an ethical dimension
to Unamuno’s ideas on suffering.
He claims that it is essential to
acknowledge our pain, because
it is only when we face the fact of
our own suffering that we become
capable of truly loving other
suffering beings. This presents us
with a stark choice. On the one
hand, we can choose happiness
and do our best to turn away from
suffering. On the other hand, we
can choose suffering and love.
The ﬁrst choice may be easier,
but it is a choice that ultimately
limits us – indeed, severs us from
an essential part of ourselves. The
second choice is more difﬁcult,
but it is one that opens the way
to the possibility of a life of depth
and signiﬁcance. ■

This is a statement of belief rather

Du Bois goes on to say that the

belief in the prospects for human
progress. But there are also hints
of deeper philosophical roots here,
going all the way back to the
ancient Greek idea of eudaimonia

philosopher Aristotle, this involved
living a life of excellence based
upon virtue and reason.

He rejects scientiﬁc racism—the
idea that black people are inferior
genetically to white people—that
was prevalent throughout most of
his life. As racial inequality has
no basis in biological science,
he regards it as a purely social
problem, one that can be addressed
only by committed political and
social activism.
Du Bois is tireless in his search
for solutions to the problem of all
forms of social inequality. He
argues that social inequality is
one of the major causes of crime,

Alongside an active career as

economic crisis following the Wall
Street Crash of 1929. It might seem
distasteful to promote the virtues

unemployment was rising to a third

parts of the world. For Russell,
however, the economic chaos of

attitudes about work. Indeed, he

about work are little more than

class and the middle class. But to
these Russell adds a third class,
who he claims has a lot to answer
for—that of the leisured landowner
who avoids all work, and who
depends on the labor of others
to support his or her idleness.
According to Russell, history is
littered with examples of people
working hard all their lives and
being allowed to keep just enough
for themselves and their families
to survive, while any surplus they
produce is appropriated by warriors,
priests, and the leisured ruling
classes. And it is always these
beneﬁciaries of the system, says ❯❯

The Great Depression was the worst
economic depression of the 20th century.
For Russell, it highlighted the need for a
critique of capitalism and a re-evaluation
of the ethics of work.

What is work?
Russell begins by deﬁning work,
which he says is of two kinds. First,
there is work aimed at “altering the
position of matter at or near the
earth’s surface relative to other
such matter.” This is the most
fundamental sense of work—that
of manual labor. The second kind of
work is “telling other people to alter
the position of matter relative to
other such matter.” This second
kind of work, Russell says, can be
extended indeﬁnitely—not only
can you have people employed to
supervise people who move matter,
but others can be employed to
supervise the supervisors, or give
advice on how to employ other
people, while still more can be
employed to manage the people
who give advice on how to employ
people, and so on. The ﬁrst kind
of work, he says, tends to be
unpleasant and badly paid, while
the second tends to be more
pleasant, and better paid. These
two types of work deﬁne two types
of worker—the laborer and the
supervisor—and these in turn relate
to two social classes—the working

Russell, who are heard extolling
the virtues of “honest toil”, giving
a moral gloss to a system that is
manifestly unjust. And this fact
alone, according to Russell, should
prompt us to re-evaluate the ethics
of work, for by embracing “honest
toil” we comply with and even
promote our own oppression.
Russell’s account of society,
with its emphasis on the struggle
between classes, owes something
to the thought of the 19th-century
philosopher Karl Marx, although
Russell was always uneasy with
Marxism, and his essay is as
critical of Marxist states as it is
of capitalist states. His view also
owes much to Max Weber’s book
The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit
of Capitalism, ﬁrst published in 1905,
particularly Weber’s examination
of the moral claims that underlie
our attitudes to work—claims that
Russell insists should be challenged.
For example, not only do we see
work as a duty and an obligation,
we also see different types of work
as occupying a hierarchy of virtue.
Manual work is generally considered
less virtuous than more skilled or
intellectual work, and we tend to
reward people in accordance with

Bertrand Russell

this perceived virtue rather than
for what they produce. And given
that we consider work itself to be
inherently virtuous, we tend to see
the unemployed as lacking in virtue.
The more we think about it, the
more it seems that our attitudes
toward work are both complex and
incoherent. What, then, can be
done? Russell’s suggestion is that
we look at work not in terms of
these curious moral ideas that
are a relic of earlier times, but in
terms of what makes for a full and
satisfying human life. And when
we do this, Russell believes, it is
hard to avoid the conclusion that
we should all simply work less.
What, Russell asks, if the working
day were only four hours long? Our
present system is such that part of
the population can be overworked,
and so miserable, while another
part can be totally unemployed,
and so also miserable. This, it
seems, does not beneﬁt anyone.

The importance of play
Russell’s view is that reducing our
working hours would free us to
pursue more creative interests.

present something of a Utopian
vision of a world in which work is
reduced to a minimum. It is not

lead to the social revolution that
Russell claims. Nor is Russell’s faith

labor entirely convincing. The raw
materials for industrial production
still need to come from somewhere.
They need to be mined and reﬁned
and exported to the place of
production, all of which depends
on manual labor. Despite these
problems, Russell’s reminder that
we need to look more closely at
our attitudes to work is one that
remains relevant today. We take as
“natural” the length of the working
week and the fact that some kinds
of work are rewarded more than
others. For many of us, neither our

work nor our leisure are as fulﬁlling
as we believe they could be, and at
the same time we cannot help
feeling that idleness is a vice.
Russell’s idea reminds us that not
only do we need to scrutinize our
working lives, but that there is a
virtue and a usefulness to lounging,
loaﬁng, and idling. As Russell
says: “Hitherto we have continued
to be as energetic as we were
before there were machines; in
this we have been foolish, but
there is no reason to go on being

with all those “companions in
thought” who have undergone
the same personal struggle. ■

Existentialism
BEFORE
1641 In his Meditations, René
Descartes argues that there
are two worlds: the world of
mind and the world of matter.
Early 1900s Edmund Husserl
establishes phenomenology. He
claims that philosophers must
look at the world anew, putting
all preconceptions aside.
AFTER
1920s Martin Heidegger
explores questions about what
our existence means for us,
citing Ortega as an inﬂuence.
1930s onward Ortega’s
philosophy becomes popular
in Spain and Latin America,
inﬂuencing philosophers
Xavier Zubiri, José Gaos,
Ignacio Ellacuría, and María
Zambrano, among others.

O

rtega y Gasset’s philosophy
is about life. He is not
interested in analyzing the
world in a cool and detached fashion.
Instead, he wants to explore how
philosophy can engage creatively
with life. Reason, Ortega believes,
is not something passive, but
something active—something that
allows us to get to grips with the
circumstances in which we ﬁnd
ourselves, and allows us to change
our lives for the better.

In his Meditations on Quixote,
published in 1914, Ortega writes:
“I am myself and my circumstances.”
Descartes said that it was possible
to imagine ourselves as thinking
beings, and yet to doubt the
existence of the external world,
including our own bodies. But
Ortega says that it makes no sense
to see ourselves as separate from
the world. If we want to think
seriously about ourselves, we have
to see that we are always immersed

We are always immersed in
particular circumstances, such
as where we live, what we do,
and things we assume.

We can accept or reject these
circumstances, by imagining
new possibilities.

The new possibilities
collide with our current
circumstances.

Life is a series of
collisions with the future.

in particular circumstances—
circumstances that are often
oppressive and limiting. These
limitations are not only those of
our physical surroundings, but also
of our thoughts, which contain
prejudices, and our behavior, which
is shaped by habit.
While many people live without
reﬂecting on the nature of their
circumstances, Ortega says that
philosophers should not only strive
to understand their circumstances
better, they should actively seek
to change them. Indeed, he claims
that the philosopher’s duty is to
expose the assumptions that
lie behind all our beliefs.

The energy of life
In order to transform the world and
to engage creatively with our own
existence, Ortega says that we
must look at our lives with fresh
eyes. This means not only looking
anew at our external circumstances,
but also looking inside ourselves to
reconsider our beliefs and prejudices.
Only when we have done this will
we be able to commit ourselves to
creating new possibilities.

Every act of hope, such as celebrating
Christmas on the front line in World
War I, is a testament to our ability
to overcome our circumstances. For
Ortega, this is “vital reason” in action.

I am myself and
my circumstances.
José Ortega y Gasset

However, there is a limit to the
amount that we can change the
world. Our habitual thinking runs
deep, and even if we free ourselves
enough to imagine new possibilities
and new futures, our external
circumstances may stand in the
way of realizing these possibilities.
The futures that we imagine will
always collide with the reality of
the circumstances in which we
ﬁnd ourselves. This is why Ortega
sees life as a series of collisions
with the future.
Ortega’s idea is challenging
on both a personal and a political
level. It reminds us that we have
a duty to attempt to change our
circumstances, even though we
may encounter difﬁculties in doing
so, and even though our attempts
may not always succeed. In The
Revolt of the Masses, he warns that
democracy carries within it the
threat of tyranny by the majority,
and that to live by majority rule—to
live “like everyone else”—is to live
without a personal vision or moral
code. Unless we engage creatively
with our own lives, we are hardly
living at all. This is why for Ortega,
reason is vital—it holds the energy
of life itself. ■

José Ortega y Gasset was
born in Madrid, Spain, in 1883.
He studied philosophy ﬁrst
in Madrid, then at various
German universities—where
he became inﬂuenced by the
philosophy of Immanuel
Kant—before settling in Spain
as a university professor.
Throughout his life, Ortega
earned a living not only as a
philosopher but as a journalist
and essayist. He was also
actively engaged in Spanish
politics in the 1920s and
1930s, but his involvement
came to an end with the
outbreak of the Spanish Civil
War in 1936. Ortega then
went into exile in Argentina,
where he stayed, disillusioned
with politics, until 1945.
After three years in Portugal,
he returned to Madrid in
1948, where he founded the
Institute of Humanities. He
continued working as a
philosopher and journalist
for the remainder of his life.

To answer these questions, we

frankly confessed that he knew

oracle at Delphi said that Socrates

Socrates, who was certain of his

conversations with people in Athens,
he came to the conclusion that he
was indeed the wisest person in

accept that he knew nothing.

The Japanese roots of Tanabe’s
idea go back to the thought of the
Buddhist monk Shinran, who
belonged to what is known as the
Pure Land school of Buddhism.
Shinran’s innovation was his claim
that enlightenment is impossible if
we rely on our own power. Instead,
we must confess our own ignorance
and limitations, so that we are open
to what both Shinran and Tanabe
call tariki, or “other power.” In the
context of Pure Land Buddhism,
this other power is that of the
Buddha Amitabha. In the context
of Tanabe’s philosophy, confession
leads to a recognition of “absolute
nothingness”, and ultimately to
self-awakening and wisdom.

Forsaking ourselves
For Tanabe, then, philosophy is
not about discussing the ﬁner
points of logic, or about arguing
or debating anything—it is not,
in fact, an “intellectual” discipline.
For Tanabe, it is something much
more fundamental—a process of
relating, in the deepest possible
sense, to our very own being—an
idea that is partly shaped by his
reading of Martin Heidegger.

It is only through confessing,
Tanabe believes, that we can
rediscover our true being—a
process he describes in directly
religious terms as a form of death
and resurrection. This death and
resurrection is the rebirth of the
mind through “other power”, and
its passing from the limited view
of the “self” to the perspective of
enlightenment. However, this shift
is not simply a preparation for
philosophy—on the contrary, it is
the very work of philosophy itself,
which is rooted in scepticism and
the “forsaking of ourselves to the
grace of other power.” Philosophy,
in other words, is not an activity
that we engage in, but something
that happens through us when we
gain access to our true selves by
letting go of the self—a phenomenon
that Tanabe calls “action without
an acting subject.”
Continual confession is, Tanabe
writes, “the ultimate conclusion”
to which the recognition of our
limitations drives us. In other
words, Tanabe asks us not to ﬁnd
new answers to old philosophical
questions, but to re-evaluate the
very nature of philosophy. ■

Philosophy of language
APPROACH
Logic

Language is
made up of propositions:
assertions about things,
which may be true or false.

The world is
made up of facts:
things are a certain way.

BEFORE
4th century BCE Aristotle
sets the foundations of logic.
Late 19th century Gottlob
Frege develops the foundations
of modern logic.

Propositions are “pictures”
of facts, in the same way that
maps are pictures of the world.

Early 20th century Bertrand
Russell develops notation that
translates natural language
into logical propositions.
AFTER
1920s Ideas in the Tractatus
are used by philosophers of the
Vienna Circle, such as Moritz
Schlick and Rudolf Carnap, to
develop Logical Positivism.
From 1930 Wittgenstein
rejects the ideas expressed in
the Tractatus, and begins to
explore very different ways
of viewing language.

W

ittgenstein’s Tractatus
Logico-Philosophicus
is perhaps one of the
most forbidding texts in the history
of 20th-century philosophy. Only
around 70 pages long in its English
translation, the book is made up of
a series of highly condensed and
technical numbered remarks.
In order to appreciate the full
signiﬁcance of the Tractatus, it
is important to set it within its
philosophical context. The fact
that Wittgenstein is talking about
the “limits” of my language and my
world sets him ﬁrmly within the

does not picture facts
is meaningless—for
example “killing is bad.”

philosophical tradition that stems
from the 18th-century German
philosopher Immanuel Kant. In
The Critique of Pure Reason, Kant
set out to explore the limits of
knowledge by posing questions
such as “What can I know?” and
“What things will lie forever outside
of human understanding?” One
reason that Kant asked such
questions was that he believed
many problems in philosophy arose
because we fail to recognize the
limitations of human understanding.
By turning our attention back onto
ourselves and asking about the

necessary limits of our knowledge,
we can then either resolve, or even
perhaps dissolve, nearly all of the
philosophical problems of the past.
The Tractatus tackles the same
kind of task that Kant did, but does
so in a far more radical fashion.
Wittgenstein states that he is
setting out to make clear what can
be meaningfully said. In much the
same way that Kant strives to set
the limits of reason, Wittgenstein
wants to set the limits of language
and, by implication, of all thought.
He does this because he suspects
that a great deal of philosophical

discussion and disagreement is
based on some fundamental errors
in how we go about thinking and
talking about the world.

Logical structure
For all of their apparent complexity,
Wittgenstein’s central ideas in
the Tractatus are essentially based
on a fairly simple principle, that
both language and the world are
formally structured, and that
these structures can be broken
down into their component parts.
Wittgenstein attempts to lay bare
the structures both of the world
and of language, and then to show
the way they relate to each other.
Having done this, he attempts to
draw a number of wide-reaching
philosophical conclusions.
If we are to understand what
Wittgenstein means when he says
that limits of my language are the
limits of my world, we need to ask
what he means by the words

symbols and stylized images of objects
in the world, known as hieroglyphs,

“world” and “language”, because
he does not use these words in the
everyday sense we might expect.
When he talks about language,
the debt Wittgenstein owes to
the British philosopher Bertrand
Russell becomes apparent. For
Russell, who was an important
ﬁgure in the development of
philosophical logic, everyday
language was inadequate for
talking clearly and precisely about
the world. He believed that logic
was a “perfect language”, which
excluded all traces of ambiguity, so
he developed a way of translating
everyday language into what he
considered a logical form.
Logic is concerned with what are
known in philosophy as propositions.
We can think of propositions as
assertions that it is possible for us
to consider as being either true or
false. For example, the statement
“the elephant is very angry” is a
proposition, but the word “elephant”
is not. According to Wittgenstein’s

■

Rudolf Carnap 257

Tractatus, meaningful language
must consist solely of propositions.
“The totality of propositions,” he
writes, “is language.”
Knowing a little about what
Wittgenstein means by language,
we can now explore what he means
by “the world.” The Tractatus
begins with the claim that “the
world is all that is the case.” This
might appear to be straightforward
and robustly matter-of-fact, but
taken on its own, it is not entirely
clear what Wittgenstein means by
this statement. He goes on to write
that “the world is the totality of
facts, not of things.” Here we can
see a parallel between the way that
Wittgenstein treats language and
the way he is treating the world. It
may be a fact, for example, that the
elephant is angry, or that there is
an elephant in the room, but an
elephant just by itself is not a fact.
From this point, it begins to
become clear how the structure
of language and that of the world ❯❯

Logic is not
a body of doctrine
but a mirror-image
of the world.
Ludwig Wittgenstein

A digital image, although not the
same sort of object as the one it depicts,
has the same “logical form.” Words only
represent reality for Wittgenstein if,
again, both have the same logical form.

might be related. Wittgenstein says
that language “pictures” the world.
He formulated this idea during
World War I, when he read in a
newspaper about a court case in
Paris. The case concerned a
car accident, and the events were
re-enacted for those present in
court using model cars and model
pedestrians to represent the cars
and pedestrians in the real world.
The model cars and the model
pedestrians were able to depict
their counterparts, because they
were related to each other in
exactly the same way as the real
cars and real pedestrians involved
in the accident. Similarly, all the
elements depicted on a map are
related to each other in exactly
the same way as they are in the
landscape that the map represents.
What a picture shares with that
which it is depicting, Wittgenstein
says, is a logical form.
It is important here to realize
that we are talking about logical
pictures, and not about visual
pictures. Wittgenstein presents a
useful example to show what he

means. The sound waves generated
by a performance of a symphony,
the score of that symphony, and the
pattern formed by the grooves on
a gramophone recording of the
symphony all share between them
the same logical form. Wittgenstein
states, “A picture is laid against
reality like a measure.” In this way
it can depict the world.
Of course, our picture may be
incorrect. It may not agree with
reality, for example, by appearing to
show that the elephant is not angry
when the elephant is, in fact, very
angry. There is no middle ground
here for Wittgenstein. Because he
starts with propositions that are,
by their very nature, true or false,
pictures also are either true or false.
Language and the world, then,
both have a logical form; and
language can speak about the
world by picturing the world, and
picturing it in a fashion that agrees
with reality. It is at this point that
Wittgenstein’s idea gets really
interesting, and it is here that we
can see why Wittgenstein is
interested in the limits of language.

Consider the following idea: “You
should give half of your salary to
charity.” This is not picturing
anything in the world in the sense
meant by Wittgenstein. What can
be said—what Wittgenstein calls
the “totality of true propositions”—
is merely the sum of all those
things that are the case, or the
natural sciences.
Discussion about religious and
ethical values is, for Wittgenstein,
strictly meaningless. Because the
things that we are attempting to
talk about when we discuss such
topics are beyond the limits of the
world, they also lie beyond the
limits of our language. Wittgenstein
writes, “It is clear that ethics cannot
be put into language.”

Beyond words
Some readers of Wittgenstein,
at this point, claim that he is a
champion of the sciences, driving
out vague concepts involved in talk
of ethics, religion, and the like. But
something more complex is going
on. Wittgenstein does not think
that the “problems of life” are

was fearless in following his
argument to its conclusion,
ultimately recognizing that the
answer to such a question must be
yes. Anybody who understands the
Tractatus properly, he claims, will
eventually see that the propositions
used in it are nonsense, too. They
are like the steps of a philosophical
ladder that helps us to climb
altogether beyond the problems of
philosophy, but which we can kick
away once we have ascended.

nonsensical. Instead, he believes
that these are the most important
problems of all. It is simply that
they cannot be put into words,
and because of this, they cannot
become a part of philosophy.
Wittgenstein writes that these
things, even though we cannot
speak of them, nevertheless make
themselves manifest, adding that
“they are what is mystical.”
All of this, however, has serious
repercussions for the propositions
that lie within the Tractatus itself.
After all, these are not propositions
that picture the world. Even logic,
one of Wittgenstein’s major tools,
does not say anything about the
world. Is the Tractatus, therefore,
nonsense? Wittgenstein himself

After completing the Tractatus,
Wittgenstein concluded that
there were no more philosophical
problems left to resolve, and so
abandoned the discipline. However,
over the course of the 1920s and
1930s, he began to question his
earlier thinking, becoming one of
its ﬁercest critics. In particular, he
questioned his once ﬁrmly held
belief that language consists
solely of propositions, a view that
ignores much of what we do in our
everyday speech—from telling
jokes, to cajoling, to scolding.
Nevertheless, despite all of its
problems, the Tractatus remains
one of the most challenging and
compelling works of Western
philosophy—and ultimately one
of the most mysterious. ■

Philosophy demands logical, unambiguous
language. Wittgenstein concludes, therefore, that it
can only be made up of propositions, or statements
of fact, such as “the cat sat on the mat”, which can
be clearly divided into their component parts.

Born into a wealthy Viennese
family in 1889, Wittgenstein
ﬁrst studied engineering and
in 1908 traveled to England
to continue his education in
Manchester. However, he soon
developed an interest in logic,
and by 1911 had moved to
Cambridge to study under the
philosopher Bertrand Russell.
During World War I, he
served on the Russian front
and in Italy, where he was
taken prisoner. Around this
time, he began the Tractatus
Logico-Philosophicus, which
was published in 1921.
Believing that the Tractatus
resolved all the problems of
philosophy, Wittgenstein now
embarked on an itinerant
career as a schoolteacher,
gardener, and architect. But
after developing criticisms of
his earlier ideas, he resumed
his work at Cambridge in
1929, becoming a professor
there in 1939. He died in 1951.

phenomenology would not look
directly at the question “what is a

look at the question “what is it like
to be human?”

The human existence

This curious story from the history
of early philosophy shows the kinds
of difﬁculties philosophers have
sometimes been faced with when
attempting to give abstract, general
deﬁnitions of what it is to be human.
Even without the intervention
of Diogenes, it seems clear that
describing ourselves as featherless
bipeds does not really capture much
of what it means to be human.

An insider’s perspective
It is this question—how we might
go about analyzing what it is to be
human—that concerned the
philosopher Martin Heidegger.
When Heidegger came to answer
the question, he did so in a way

that was strikingly different from
many of his predecessors. Instead
of attempting an abstract deﬁnition
that looks at human life from the
outside, he attempts to provide a
much more concrete analysis of
“being” from what could be called
an insider’s position. He says that
since we exist in the thick of
things—in the midst of life—if we
want to understand what it is to be
human, we have to do so by looking
at human life from within this life.
Heidegger was a student of
Husserl, and he followed Husserl’s
method of phenomenology. This
is a philosophical approach that
looks at phenomena—how things
appear—through examining our

For Heidegger, this constitutes the
fundamental question of philosophy.
He was most interested in the
philosophical subject of ontology
(from the Greek word ontos,
meaning “being”), which looks at
questions about being or existence.
Examples of ontological questions
might be: “what does it mean to say
that something exists?” and “what
are the different kinds of things
that exist?” Heidegger wanted use
the question “what is it like to be
human?” as a way of answering
deeper questions about existence
in general.
In his book, Being and Time,
Heidegger claims that when other
philosophers have asked ontological
questions, they have tended to use
approaches that are too abstract
and shallow. If we want to know

We should raise anew

Martin Heidegger

that lend life a unity. Being human,
Heidegger says, means to be immersed
in the day-to-day world.

at the question from the perspective
of those beings for whom being is
an issue. We can assume that
although cats, dogs, and toadstools
are beings, they do not wonder
about their being: they do not fret
over ontological questions; they do
not ask “what does it mean to say
that something exists?” But there
is, Heidegger points out, one being
that does wonder about these

things, and that is the human being.
In saying that we are ourselves the
entities to be analyzed, Heidegger is
saying that if we want to explore
questions of being, we have to start
with ourselves, by looking at what
it means for us to exist.

Being and time
When Heidegger asks about
the meaning of being, he is not
asking about abstract ideas, but
about something very direct and
immediate. In the opening pages of
his book, he says that the meaning
of our being must be tied up with
time; we are essentially temporal

beings. When we are born, we ﬁnd
ourselves in the world as if we had
been thrown here on a trajectory
we have not chosen. We simply ﬁnd
that we have come to exist, in an
ongoing world that pre-existed us,
so that at our birth we are presented
with a particular historical, material,
and spiritual environment. We
attempt to make sense of this world
by engaging in various pastimes—
for example, we might learn Latin, or
attempt to ﬁnd true love, or decide
to build ourselves a house. Through
these time-consuming projects we
literally project ourselves toward
different possible futures; we deﬁne
our existence. However, sometimes
we become aware that there is an
outermost limit to all our projects, a
point at which everything we plan
will come to an end, whether ﬁnished
or unﬁnished. This point is the
point of our death. Death, Heidegger
says, is the outermost horizon of our
being: everything we can do or see
or think takes place within this
horizon. We cannot see beyond it.
Heidegger’s technical vocabulary
is famously difﬁcult to understand,
but this is largely because he is
attempting to explore complex
philosophical questions in a concrete
or non-abstract way; he wants to
relate to our actual experience. To
say that “the furthest horizon of our

being is death” is to say something
about what it is like to live a human
life, and it captures some idea of
what we are in a way that many
philosophical deﬁnitions—
“featherless biped” or “political
animal”, for example—overlook.

Living authentically
It is to Heidegger that we owe the
philosophical distinction between
authentic and inauthentic existence.
Most of the time we are wrapped
up in various ongoing projects, and
forget about death. But in seeing
our life purely in terms of the
projects in which we are engaged,
we miss a more fundamental
dimension of our existence, and to
that extent, Heidegger says, we are
existing inauthentically. When we
become aware of death as the
ultimate limit of our possibilities, we
start to reach a deeper understanding
of what it means to exist.
For example, when a good friend
dies, we may look at our own lives
and realize that the various projects
which absorb us from day to day
feel meaningless, and that there is
a deeper dimension to life that is

All being is a “being-towards-death”,
but only humans recognize this. Our
lives are temporal, and it is only once
we realize this that we can live a
meaningful and authentic life.

understood existentially.

missing. And so we may ﬁnd
ourselves changing our priorities
and projecting ourselves toward
different futures.

A deeper language
Heidegger’s later philosophy
continues to tackle questions of
being, but it turns away from his
earlier, exacting approach to take
a more poetic look at the same
kinds of questions. Philosophy, he
comes to suspect, simply cannot
reﬂect this deeply on our own
being. In order to ask questions
about human existence, we must
use the richer, deeper language of
poetry, which engages us in a way
that goes far beyond the mere
exchange of information.
Heidegger was one of the
20th century’s most inﬂuential
philosophers. His early attempt to
analyze what it means to be
human, and how one might live an
authentic life, inspired philosophers
such as Sartre, Levinas, and
Gadamer, and contributed to the
birth of existentialism. His later,
more poetic, thinking has also had
a powerful inﬂuence on ecological
philosophers, who believe it offers
a way of thinking about what it
means to be a human being
within a world under threat of
environmental destruction. ■

Heidegger is acknowledged to
be one of the most important
philosophers of the 20th
century. He was born in 1889
in Messkirch, Germany, and
had early aspirations to be a
priest, but after coming across
the writings of Husserl he took
up philosophy instead. He
quickly became well known as
an inspirational lecturer, and
was nicknamed “the magician
of Messkirch.” In the 1930s he
became rector of Freiburg
University and a member of
the Nazi party. The extent and
nature of his involvement with
Nazism remains controversial,
as is the question of how far
his philosophy is implicated in
the ideologies of Nazism.
Heidegger spent the last
30 years of his life traveling
and writing, exchanging ideas
with friends such as Hannah
Arendt and the physicist
Werner Heisenberg. He died
in Freiburg in 1976, aged 86.

Europe, and like many Japanese
philosophers of his time, his work
shows a creative synthesis of these
two very different traditions.

Forgetting the self
Watsuji’s studies of Western
approaches to ethics convinced him
that thinkers in the West tend to
take an individualistic approach to
human nature, and so also to ethics.
But for Watsuji, individuals can only
be understood as expressions of
their particular times, relationships,
and social contexts, which together
constitute a “climate”. He explores
the idea of human nature in terms
of our relationships with the wider

community, which form a network
within which we exist; Watsuji calls
this “betweenness.” For Watsuji
ethics is a matter not of individual
action, but of the forgetting or
sacriﬁce of one’s self, so that the
individual can work for the beneﬁt
of the wider community.
Watsuji’s nationalist ethics and
insistence on the superiority of the
Japanese race led to his fall from
favor following World War II,
although he later distanced himself
from these views. ■

Samurai warriors often sacriﬁced
their own lives in battle in order to save
the state, in an act of extreme loyalty
and self-negation that Watsuji called

that the task of philosophy is to

of deepening our understanding by
starting from what we already
know. The process is similar to how

the “regularities” of nature—the fact
that events unfold in the world in
particular patterns and sequences
that can be systematically explored.
Science, in other words, is empirical,
or based on experience, and to
understand how it works we need
to understand how experience in
general leads to knowledge.
Consider the following statement:
“If you drop a tennis ball from a
second-ﬂoor window, it will fall to
the ground.” Leaving aside any
chance events (such as the ball
being snatched away by a passing
eagle), we can be fairly sure that
this claim is a reasonable one. It
would be a strange person who
said, “Hold on, are you sure it will

fall to the ground?” But how do we
know that this is what will happen
when we drop the tennis ball?
What kind of knowledge is this?
The short answer is that we
know it will fall because that is
what it always does. Leaving aside
chance events, no-one has ever
found that a tennis ball hovers or
rises upward when it is released.
We know it falls to the ground
because experience has shown us
that this will happen. And not only
can we be sure that the ball will fall
to the ground, we can also be sure
about how it will fall to the ground.
For example, if we know the force of
gravity, and how high the window
is above the ground, we can

calculate the speed at which the
ball will fall. Nothing about the
event is even remotely mysterious.
Nevertheless, the question
remains: can we be certain that the
next time we drop the ball it will
fall to the ground? No matter how
often we conduct the experiment,
and no matter how conﬁdent we
become about its outcome, we can
never prove that the result will be
the same in the future.

Inductive reasoning
This inability to speak with any
certainty about the future is called
the problem of induction, and it
was ﬁrst recognized by Hume
in the 18th century. So what is
inductive reasoning?
Induction is the process of
moving from a set of observed facts
about the world to more general
conclusions about the world. We
expect that if we drop the ball it
will fall to the ground because, at
least according to Hume, we are
generalizing from innumerable ❯❯

264 KARL POPPER
experiences of similar occasions
on which we have found things
like balls to fall to the ground
when we release them.

Deductive reasoning
Another form of reasoning,
which philosophers contrast with
induction, is deductive reasoning.
While induction moves from the
particular case to the general,
deduction moves from the general
case to the particular. For instance,
a piece of deductive reasoning might
start from two premises, such as:
“If it is an apple, then it is a fruit
(since all apples are fruit)” and
“This is an apple.” Given the nature
of these premises, the statement
“This is an apple” leads inescapably
to the conclusion “It is a fruit.”
Philosophers like to simplify
deductive arguments by writing
them out in notation. So the general
form of the argument above would
be “If P then Q; since P, therefore
Q.” In our example, “P” stands for
“It is an apple”, and “Q” stands for
An example of the
problem of induction is

a tennis ball behaves in
the present, we can never
know for certain how it
will behave in the future.

“It is a fruit.” Given the starting
points “If P then Q” and “P”, then
the conclusion “Q” is necessary, or
unavoidably true. Another example
would be: “If it is raining, the cat
will meow (since all cats meow
in the rain). It is raining, therefore
the cat will meow.”
All arguments of this kind are
considered by philosophers to be
valid arguments, because their
conclusions follow inevitably from
their premises. However, the fact
that an argument is valid does not
mean that its conclusions are true.
For example, the argument “If it is
a cat, then it is banana-ﬂavored;
this is a cat, therefore it is bananaﬂavored” is valid, because it follows
a valid form. But most people would
agree that the conclusion is false.
And a closer look shows that there
is a problem, from an empirical
perspective, with the premise “If it
is a cat, then it is banana-ﬂavored”,
because cats, in our world at least,
are not banana-ﬂavored. In other
words, because the premise is

untrue, even though the argument
itself is valid, the conclusion is
also untrue. Other worlds can be
imagined in which cats are in fact
banana-ﬂavored, and for this reason
the statement that cats
are not banana-ﬂavored is said to
be contingently true, rather than
logically or necessarily true, which
would demand that it be true in
all possible worlds. Nevertheless,
arguments that are valid and have
true premises are called “sound”

arguments. The banana-ﬂavored
cat argument, as we have seen,
is valid but not sound—whereas
the argument about apples and
fruit is both valid and sound.

Falsiﬁability
Deductive arguments could be said
to be like computer programs—the
conclusions they reach are only as
good as the data that is fed into
them. Deductive reasoning has
an important role to play in the
sciences, but on its own, it cannot
say anything about the world. It
can only say “If this is the case,
then that is the case.” And if we
want to use such arguments in the

Karl Popper

sciences, we still have to rely on
induction for our premises, and
so science is lumbered with the
problem of induction.
For this reason, according to
Popper, we cannot prove our
theories to be true. Moreover, what
makes a theory scientiﬁc is not that
it can be proved at all, but that it
can be tested against reality and
shown to be potentially false. In
other words, a falsiﬁable theory
is not a theory that is false, but
one that can only be shown to be
false by observation.
Theories that are untestable (for
example, that we each have an
invisible spirit guide, or that God
created the universe) are not part
of the natural sciences. This does
not mean that they are worthless,
only that they are not the kinds of
theories that the sciences deal with.
The idea of falsiﬁability does not
mean we are unjustiﬁed in having
a belief in theories that cannot be
falsiﬁed. Beliefs that stand up to
repeated testing, and that resist
our attempts at falsiﬁcation, can be
taken to be reliable. But even the
best theories are always open to
the possibility that a new result
will show them to be false.
Karl Popper was born in Vienna,
Austria, in 1902. He studied
philosophy at the University of
Vienna, after which he spent six
years as a schoolteacher. It was
during this time that he published
The Logic of Scientiﬁc Discovery,

of how they go about their work,
and that science is practiced very
differently from how Popper

distinguishing between scientiﬁc
and non-scientiﬁc claims, and

and ethical dimensions of
popular culture.

T

he idea of the holy fool has
a long tradition in the West,
dating all the way back to
Saint Paul’s letter to the Corinthians
in which he asks his followers to be
“fools for Christ’s sake.” Throughout
the Middle Ages this idea was
developed into the popular cultural
ﬁgure of the saint or sage who was
foolish or lacked intelligence, but
who was morally good or pure.
In his book Minima Moralia, the
German philosopher Theodor Adorno
calls into question this long tradition.
He is suspicious of attempts to (as
he puts it) “absolve and beatify the

blockhead”, and wants to make the
case that goodness involves our
entire being, both our feeling and
our understanding.
The problem with the idea of
the holy fool, Adorno says, is that
it divides us into different parts,
and in doing so makes us incapable
of acting judiciously at all. In reality,
judgement is measured by the
extent to which we manage to
make feeling and understanding
cohere. Adorno’s view implies that
evil acts are not just failures of
feeling, but also failures of
intelligence and understanding.

Emotion

Intelligence

Both are needed for me
to make judgements about
what is right and wrong.

So to act morally I need to
be able to use my intelligence
as well as my emotions.

Intelligence is a
moral category.

Georg Hegel 178–85

Adorno was a member of the
Frankfurt School, a group of
philosophers who were interested
in the development of capitalism.
He condemned forms of mass
communication such as television
and radio, claiming that these
have led to the erosion of both
intelligence and feeling, and to a
decline in the ability to make moral
choices and judgements. If we
choose to switch off our brains
by watching blockbuster movies
(insofar as we can choose at all,
given the prevailing cultural
conditions in which we live), for
Adorno, this is a moral choice.
Popular culture, he believes, not
only makes us stupid; it also
makes us unable to act morally.

Essential emotions
Adorno believes that the opposite
error to that of imagining that there
might be such a thing as a holy fool
is imagining that we can judge on
intelligence alone, without emotion.
This might happen in a court of
law; judges have been known to
instruct the jury to put all emotion
to one side, so that they can come
to a cool and measured decision.

The power of judgement
is measured by the
cohesion of self.

Theodor Adorno
Lighthearted television is inherently
dangerous, says Adorno, because it
distorts the world and imbues us with
stereotypes and biases that we begin
to take on as our own.

But in Adorno’s view, we can no
more make wise judgements by
abandoning emotion than we can
by abandoning intelligence.
When the last trace of emotion
has been driven out of our thinking,
Adorno writes, we are left with
nothing to think about, and the idea
that intelligence might beneﬁt “from
the decay of the emotions” is simply
mistaken. For this reason Adorno
believes that the sciences, which
are a form of knowledge that do not
make reference to our emotions,
have, like popular culture, had a
dehumanizing effect upon us.
Unexpectedly, it may in fact be
the sciences that will ultimately
demonstrate the wisdom of
Adorno’s central concerns about
the severing of intelligence and
feeling. Since the 1990s, scientists
such as Antonio Damasio have
studied emotions and the brain,
providing increasing evidence of
the many mechanisms by which
emotions guide decision-making.
So if we are to judge wisely or even
to judge at all, we must employ both
emotion and intelligence. ■

Born in 1903 in Frankfurt,
Theodor Adorno’s two
passions from an early age
were philosophy and music;
his mother and aunt were
both accomplished musicians.
At university Adorno studied
musicology and philosophy,
graduating in 1924. He had
ambitions to be a composer,
but setbacks in his musical
career led him increasingly
toward philosophy. One area
in which Adorno’s interests
converged was in his criticism
of the industry surrounding
popular culture, demonstrated
in his notorious essay On
Jazz, published in 1936.
In 1938, during the rise of
Nazism in Germany, Adorno
emigrated to New York, and
then moved to Los Angeles,
where he taught at the
University of California. He
returned to Germany after
the end of World War II, and
took up a professorship at
Frankfurt. Adorno died at the
age of 66 while on holiday in
Switzerland in 1969.

that it is inconceivable for a paperknife to exist without its maker
knowing what it is going to be used

paper-knife—or all of the things
that make it a paper-knife and not

We are not made for any particular
purpose. We exist, but not because
of our purpose or essence like a
paper-knife does; our existence
precedes our essence.

Deﬁning ourselves
This is where we begin to see the
connection between Sartre’s claim
that “existence precedes essence”
and his atheism. Sartre points out
that religious approaches to the
question of human nature often
work by means of an analogy with

human craftsmanship—that
human nature in the mind of God
is analogous to the nature of the
paper-knife in the mind of the
craftsman who makes it. Even
many non-religious theories of
human nature, Sartre claims, still
have their roots in religious ways of
thinking, because they continue to
insist that essence comes before
existence, or that we are made for a
speciﬁc purpose. In claiming that
existence comes before essence,
Sartre is setting out a position that
he believes is more consistent with

his atheism. There is no universal,
ﬁxed human nature, he declares,
because no God exists who could
ordain such a nature.
Here Sartre is relying on a very
speciﬁc deﬁnition of human nature,
identifying the nature of something
with its purpose. He is rejecting the
concept of what philosophers call
teleology in human nature—that it
is something that we can think
about in terms of the purpose of
human existence. Nevertheless,
there is a sense in which Sartre is
offering a theory of human nature,
by claiming that we are the kinds
of beings who are compelled to
assign a purpose to our lives. With
no divine power to prescribe that
purpose, we must deﬁne ourselves.
Deﬁning ourselves, however, is
not just a matter of being able to
say what we are as human beings.
Instead, it is a matter of shaping
ourselves into whatever kind of
being we choose to become. This
is what makes us, at root, different
from all the other kinds of being
in the world—we can become
whatever we choose to make of
ourselves. A rock is simply a rock;
a cauliﬂower is simply a cauliﬂower;
and a mouse is simply a mouse. But
human beings possess the ability
to actively shape themselves.

First of all man exists,
turns up, appears on the
scene, and only afterwards
deﬁnes himself.
Jean-Paul Sartre

THE MODERN WORLD 271
Sartre’s idea that we are free to shape
our own lives inﬂuenced the students
that took to the streets of Paris in May
1968 to protest against the draconian
powers of the university authorities.

Because Sartre’s philosophy
releases us from the constraint of
a human nature that is preordained,
it is also one of freedom. We are free
to choose how to shape ourselves,
although we do have to accept
some limitations. No amount of
willing myself to grow wings, for
example, will ever cause that to
happen. But even within the range
of realistic choices we have, we
often ﬁnd that we are constrained
and simply make decisions based
upon habit, or because of the
way in which we have become
accustomed to see ourselves.
Sartre wants us to break free
of habitual ways of thinking, telling
us to face up to the implications of
living in a world in which nothing
is preordained. To avoid falling into
unconscious patterns of behavior, he
believes we must continually face
up to choices about how to act.

Responsible freedom
By making choices, we are also
creating a template for how we think
a human life ought to be. If I decide

As far as men go,
it is not what they are that
interests me, but what
they can become.
Jean-Paul Sartre

to become a philosopher, then I am
not just deciding for myself. I am
implicitly saying that being a
philosopher is a worthwhile activity.
This means that freedom is the
greatest responsibility of all. We
are not just responsible for the
impact that our choices have upon
ourselves, but also for their impact
on the whole of mankind. And,
with no external principles or rules
to justify our actions, we have
no excuses to hide behind for the
choices that we make. For this
reason, Sartre declares that we are
“condemned to be free.”
Sartre’s philosophy of linking
freedom with responsibility has
been labelled as pessimistic, but
he refutes that charge. Indeed, he
states that it is the most optimistic
philosophy possible, because
despite bearing responsibility for
the impact of our actions upon
others, we are able to choose to
exercise sole control over how we
fashion our world and ourselves.

Sartre’s ideas were particularly
inﬂuential on the writings of his
companion and fellow philosopher
Simone de Beauvoir, but they also
had a marked impact on French
cultural and daily life. Young people
especially were thrilled by his call
to use their freedom to fashion
their existence. He inspired them
to challenge the traditionalist,
authoritarian attitudes that prevailed
in France in the 1950s and 1960s.
Sartre is cited as a key inﬂuence
on the streets protests in Paris in
May 1968, which helped to bring
down the conservative government
and herald a more liberal climate
throughout France.
Engagement with political
issues was an important part
of Sartre’s life. His constantly
changing afﬁliations, as well as
his perpetual movement between
politics, philosophy, and literature,
are themselves perhaps testament
to a life lived in the light of the idea
that existence precedes essence. ■

Cognitive science

Man is in the world and
only in the world

Maurice Merleau-Ponty

Husserl at the beginning of the
20th century. Husserl wanted to
explore ﬁrst-person experience in
a systematic way, while putting all
assumptions about it to one side.

The body-subject
Merleau-Ponty takes up Husserl’s
approach, but with one important
difference. He is concerned that
Husserl ignores what is most
important about our experience—
the fact that it consists not just
of mental experience, but also of
bodily experience. In his most
important book, The Phenomenology
of Perception, Merleau-Ponty
explores this idea and comes to
the conclusion that the mind and
body are not separate entities—
a thought that contradicts a long
philosophical tradition championed
by Descartes. For Merleau-Ponty,
we have to see that thought and
perception are embodied, and
that the world, consciousness, and
the body are all part of a single
system. And his alternative to the
disembodied mind proposed by
Descartes is what he calls the bodysubject. In other words, MerleauPonty rejects the dualist’s view that
the world is made of two separate
entities, called mind and matter.

Because he was interested in seeing
the world anew, Merleau-Ponty took
an interest in cases of abnormal
experience. For example, he believed
that the phantom limb phenomenon
(in which an amuptee “feels” his
missing limb) shows that the body
cannot simply be a machine. If it
were, the body would no longer
acknowledge the missing part—but
it still exists for the subject because
the limb has always been bound
up with the subject’s will. In other
words, the body is never “just” a
body—it is always a “lived” body.
Merleau-Ponty’s focus on the role
of the body in experience, and his
insights into the nature of the mind
as fundamentally embodied, have
led to a revival of interest in his work
among cognitive scientists. Many
recent developments in cognitive
science seem to bear out his idea
that, once we break with our familiar
acceptance of the world, experience
is very strange indeed. ■

philosophers, such as Aristotle,
have been explicit in equating full
humanity with maleness. Others
have not said as much, but have
nevertheless taken maleness as the
standard against which humanity

is to be judged. It is for this reason
that de Beauvoir says that the Self
(or “I”) of philosophical knowledge
is by default male, and his binary
pair—the female—is therefore
something else, which she calls
the Other. The Self is active and
knowing, whereas the Other is all
that the Self rejects: passivity,
voicelessness, and powerlessness.

the same as men. She claims that
this idea is mistaken, because it
ignores the fact that women and
men are different. De Beauvoir’s
philosophical background was in
phenomenology, the study of how
things appear to our experience.
This view maintains that each of us
constructs the world from within the
frame of our own consciousness; we
constitute things and meanings
from the stream of our experiences.
Consequently de Beauvoir maintains
that the relationship that we have to
our own bodies, to others, and to the
world, as well as to philosophy itself,
is strongly inﬂuenced by whether
we are male or female.

construct. Since any construct is
open to change and interpretion, this
means that there are many ways of
“being a woman”; there is room for
existential choice. In the introduction
to The Second Sex de Beauvoir
notes society’s awareness of this
ﬂuidity: “We are exhorted to be
women, remain women, become
women. It would appear, then, that
every female human being is not
necessarily a woman.” She later
states the position explicitly: “One
is not born but becomes a woman.”
De Beauvoir says that women
must free themselves both from the
idea that they must be like men, and
from the passivity that society has
induced in them. Living a truly
authentic existence carries more
risk than accepting a role handed
down by society, but it is the only
path to equality and freedom. ■

Existential feminism
Simone De Beauvoir was also an
existentialist, believing that we are
born without purpose and must
carve out an authentic existence for
ourselves, choosing what to become.

of “woman”, she asks us to separate

form which females are born into)

LANGUAGE IS
A SOCIAL ART

IN CONTEXT

Philosophy of language

…because we become used
to the ways in which they
are used by others…

Words are
meaningful to us…

APPROACH
Analytic philosophy
BEFORE
c.400 BCE Plato’s Cratylus
investigates the relationship
between words and things.
19th century Søren
Kierkegaard stresses the
importance of the study of
language for philosophy.
1950s Ludwig Wittgenstein
writes that there is no such
thing as a private language.
AFTER
1980s Richard Rorty suggests
that knowledge is more like
“conversation” than the
representation of reality.
1990s In Consciousness
Explained, Quine’s former
student Daniel Dennett says
that both meaning and inner
experience can only be
understood as social acts.

…not because there is
a link between words
and actual things.

The way that language
is used socially
makes it meaningful.

Language is
a social art.

S

ome philosophers assert
that language is about the
relationship between words
and things. Quine, however,
disagrees. Language is not about
the relationship between objects
and verbal signiﬁers, but about
knowing what to say and when to
say it. It is, he says in his 1968 essay
Ontological Relativity, a social art.
Quine suggests the following
thought experiment. Imagine that
we come across some people—
perhaps natives of another country—
who speak a language we do not
share. We are sitting with a group

of these people when a rabbit
appears, and one of the natives
says “gavagai.” We wonder if there
can be a connection between the
event—the appearance of the
rabbit—and the fact that the native
says “gavagai.” As time goes on,
we note that every time a rabbit
appears, somebody says “gavagai”,
so we conclude that “gavagai” can
be reliably translated as rabbit.
But, Quine insists, we are wrong.
“Gavagai” could mean all manner
of things. It could mean “oh, look,
dinner!” for example, or it could
mean “behold, a ﬂuffy creature!”

If we wanted to determine the
meaning of “gavagai”, we could try
another method. We could point to
other ﬂuffy creatures (or other things
on the dinner menu) and see if our
utterance of “gavagai” met with
assent or dissent. But even if we
were to reach a position where, in
each and every occasion on which
“gavagai” was uttered, we ourselves
would utter the word “rabbit”, we
still could not be sure that this was
an appropriate translation. “Gavagai”
could mean “set of rabbit parts” or
“wood-living rabbit” or “rabbit or
hare”; it might even refer to a short
prayer that must be uttered
whenever a rabbit is seen.

■

Ferdinand de Saussure 223

No word has a ﬁxed meaning,
according to Quine. When the
word “rabbit” is spoken, it may
mean any one of a number
of things, depending on the
context in which it is said.

Unsettled language
In attempting to establish the
precise meaning of this mysterious
“gavagai”, therefore, we might think
that the solution would be to learn
the language of our informants
thoroughly, so that we could be
absolutely sure of the contexts in
which the word was spoken. But
this would only result in multiplying
the problem, because we could not

Willard Van
Orman Quine

be sure that the other words we
found ourselves using to explain
the meaning of “gavagai” were
themselves accurate translations.
Quine refers to this problem as
the “indeterminacy of translation”,
and it has unsettling implications.
It suggests that ultimately words
do not have meanings. The sense

of somebody uttering “gavagai”
(or, for that matter, “rabbit”), and
of this utterance being meaningful
comes not from some mysterious
link between words and things,
but from the patterns of our
behavior, and the fact that we
have learned to participate in
language as a social art. ■

Born in 1908 in Ohio, USA, Quine
studied at Harvard with Alfred
North Whitehead, a philosopher
of logic and mathematics. While
there he also met Bertrand
Russell, who was to become a
profound inﬂuence on his thought.
After completing his PhD in 1932,
Quine traveled throughout Europe,
meeting many of its most eminent
philosophers, including several of
the Vienna Circle.
Returning to teach at Harvard,
Quine’s philosophical career was
brieﬂy interrupted during World
War II when he spent four years
decrypting messages for the US

Navy intelligence. A great
traveler, he was said to be
prouder of the fact that he had
visited 118 countries than of his
many awards and fellowships.
Quine became professor of
philosophy at Harvard in 1956,
and taught there until his death
in 2000, aged 92.

W

hat does it mean to be
free? This is the question
explored by the British
philosopher Isaiah Berlin in his
famous essay Two Concepts of
Liberty, written in 1958. Here he
makes a distinction between what
he calls “positive” and “negative”

freedom. Although he is not the ﬁrst
to draw this distinction, he does so
with great originality, and uses it to
expose apparent inconsistencies in
our everyday notion of freedom.
For Berlin, “negative” freedom
is what he calls our “fundamental
sense” of freedom. This kind of

Søren Kierkegaard 194–95 ■ Karl Marx 196–203 ■ Jean-Paul Sartre 268–71

For Berlin, the problem is that these
two forms of freedom are often in
conﬂict. Think, for example, of
the freedom that comes from the
discipline of learning how to play
the tuba. As a beginner, I can
do little more than struggle with
my own inability to play—but
eventually I can play with a kind
of liberated gusto. Or think of the
fact that people frequently exercise
their “positive” freedom by voting
for a particular government,
knowing that their “negative”
freedom will be restricted when
that government comes to power.

The goals of life

Soviet propaganda often depicted
workers liberated from capitalism.
From a capitalist view, however, such
images showed a triumph of negative
freedom over positive freedom.

freedom is freedom from external
obstacles: I am free because I am
not chained to a rock, because I am
not in prison, and so on. This is
freedom from something else. But
Berlin points out that when we
talk about freedom, we usually
mean something more subtle than
this. Freedom is also a matter of
self-determination, of being a
person with hopes, and intentions,
and purposes that are one’s own.
This “positive” freedom is about
being in control of one’s own
destiny. After all, I am not free just
because all the doors of my house
are unlocked. And this positive
freedom is not exclusively personal,
because self-determination can
also be desired at the level of the
group or of the state.

Berlin points to another problem.
Who is to say what a suitable goal
of “positive” freedom should be?
Authoritarian or totalitarian
regimes often have an inﬂexible
view of the purpose of human life,
and so restrict “negative” freedoms
to maximize their idea of human
happiness. Indeed, political
oppression frequently arises from an
abstract idea of what the good life
is, followed by state intervention
to make that idea a reality.
Berlin’s response to this is
twofold. First, it is important to
recognize that the various freedoms
we may desire will always be in
conﬂict, for there is no such thing
as “the goal of life”—only the goals
of particular individuals. This
fact, he claims, is obscured by
philosophers who look for a universal
basis for morality, but confuse “right
action” with the purpose of life
itself. Second, we need to keep
alive the fundamental sense of
freedom as an absence of “bullying
and domination”, so that we do not
ﬁnd our ideals turning into chains
for ourselves and for others. ■

Isaiah Berlin
Isaiah Berlin was born in Riga,
Latvia, in 1909. He spent the
ﬁrst part of his life in Russia,
ﬁrstly under the Russian
empire, and then under the
rule of the new Communist
state. Due to rising antiSemitism, however, and
problems with the Soviet
régime, his family emigrated
to Britain in 1921. Berlin was
an outstanding student at
Oxford University, where he
remained as a lecturer. He
was a philosopher with broad
interests, ranging from art and
literature to politics. His essay
Two Concepts of Liberty was
delivered in 1958 at Oxford
University, and it is often
considered one of the classics
of 20th-century political
theory. He is celebrated for
being one of the foremost

he injunction to think like

coined in 1973 by the Norwegian
philosopher and environmental
campaigner, Arne Naess. He uses
the term to stress his belief that we
must ﬁrst recognize we are part of
nature, and not separate from it, if
we are to avoid environmental
catastrophe. But the notion of
thinking like a mountain goes back
to 1949, when it was expressed by
American ecologist Aldo Leopold
in The Sand County Almanac.

Working as a forester in New
Mexico in the early part of the
20th century, Leopold shot a female
wolf on the mountainside. “We
reached the old wolf in time to
watch a ﬁerce green ﬁre dying in
her eyes," he wrote. “I realized then,
and have known ever since, that
there was something new to me in
those eyes—something known only
to her and to the mountain.” It was

came to the idea that we should
think like a mountain, recognizing
not just our needs or those of our
fellow humans, but those of the

that often we miss the broader
implications of our actions, only
considering the immediate beneﬁts
to ourselves. To “think like a
mountain” means identifying with
the wider environment and being
aware of its role in our lives.

Harmonizing with nature
Naess takes up Leopold's idea by
proposing his “deep ecology.” He
states that we only protect our
environment by undergoing the
kind of transformation of which
Leopold writes. Naess urges us to

move toward seeing ourselves as
part of the whole biosphere. Instead
of viewing the world with a kind of
detachment, we must ﬁnd our place
in nature, by acknowledging the
intrinsic value of all elements of the
world we inhabit.
Naess introduces the “ecological
self”, a sense of self that is rooted in
an awareness of our relationship to
a “larger community of all living
beings." He claims that broadening
our identiﬁcation with the world to
include wolves, frogs, spiders, and
perhaps even mountains, leads to a
more joyful and meaningful life.
Naess’s "deep ecology" has had
a powerful effect on environmental
philosophy and on the development
of environmental activism. For
those of us who live in cities, it may
seem hard or even impossible to
connect with an "ecological self."
Nevertheless, it may be possible.
As the Zen master Robert Aitken
Roshi wrote in 1984, “When one
thinks like a mountain, one thinks
also like the black bear, so that
honey dribbles down your fur as
you catch the bus to work.” ■

of living as fully as possible.

Life will be lived

Camus’ idea appears in his essay
The Myth of Sisyphus. Sisyphus
was a Greek king who fell out of
favor with the gods, and so was
sentenced to a terrible fate in the
Underworld. His task was to roll
an enormous rock to the top of a

task again, repeating this for all

Camus recognizes that much of what
we do certainly seems meaningful,
but what he is suggesting is quite
subtle. On the one hand, we are
conscious beings who cannot
help living our lives as if they are
meaningful. On the other hand,
these meanings do not reside out
there in the universe; they reside
only in our minds. The universe as
a whole has no meaning and no
purpose; it just is. But because,
unlike other living things, we have
consciousness, we are the kinds of
beings who ﬁnd meaning and
purpose everywhere.
Sisyphus was condemned eternally
to push a rock up a hill, but Camus
thought he might ﬁnd freedom even
in this grim situation if he accepted
the meaninglessness of his eternal task.

this myth, because it seemed to
him to encapsulate something of the
meaninglessness and absurdity of

struggle to perform tasks that are
essentially meaningless.

Recognizing the absurd
The absurd, for Camus, is the feeling
that we have when we recognize
that the meanings we give to life
do not exist beyond our own
consciousness. It is the result of
a contradiction between our own
sense of life’s meaning, and our
knowledge that nevertheless the
universe as a whole is meaningless.
Camus explores what it might

he closing decades of the
20th century were notable
for accelerating advances
in technology and the subsequent
improvement in communications
of all kinds. The increasing power
of the mass media, especially
television, since the end of World
War II had fuelled a rise in popular
culture with its associated
antiestablishment ideals, and this
in turn was prompting political and
social change. From the 1960s
onward, the old order was being
questioned in Europe and the US,
and dissent gathered momentum
in Eastern Europe.
By the 1980s, relations between
the East and West were thawing,
and the Cold War was coming to a
close; the fall of the Berlin Wall in
1989 offered hope for the new
decade. But the 1990s was a period

of ethnic and religious unrest,
culminating in the US declaring
a “War on Terror” at the start of the
new millennium.

Elitist philosophies
Culture in the West went through
similarly signiﬁcant changes. The
gap between popular and “high”
culture widened after the 1960s, as
the intellectual avant-garde often
decided to disregard public taste.
Philosophy followed a similarly
elitist path, particularly after the
death of Jean-Paul Sartre, whose
Marxist existentialism—beloved of
1960s intellectuals—now had less
of an audience.
Continental philosophy was
dominated in the 1970s and 80s
by structuralism, a movement
that grew from literature-based
French philosophy. Central to

this movement was the notion
of “deconstructing” texts and
revealing them to be inherently
unstable, with many contradictory
meanings. The theory’s principal
proponents—French theorists Louis
Althusser, Jacques Derrida, and
Michel Foucault—linked their
textual analyses with left-wing
politics, while the analyst Jacques
Lacan gave structuralism a
psychoanalytic perspective. Their
ideas were soon taken up by a
generation of writers and artists
working under the banner of
“postmodernism”, which rejected
all possibility of a single, objective
truth, viewpoint, or narrative.
Structuralism’s contribution to
philosophy was not enthusiastically
received by philosophers in the
English-speaking world, who

suspicion, and largely with derision.
Within a philosophical tradition of
linguistic analysis, continental
structuralism seemed ultimately
simplistic—although it was often
written in impenetrable prose that
belied its literary roots.
The squabbles of philosophers
did not inspire the popular culture
of the time. This may have been
because postmodernism was largely
incomprehensible to the general
public. Their most common
experience of it was postmodern art,
which was highly conceptual and
accompanied by knowing references
by an intellectual elite. It seemed to
deliberately exclude any possibility
of mass appreciation, and became
seen as an abstract philosophy only
enjoyed by professional academics
and artists, and out of touch with
the world most people lived in. The

public, as well as businesses and
governments, wanted more downto-earth guidance from philosophy.

A more practical approach
Though postmodern philosophy
may not have found favor with the
majority of the general public, some
philosophers of the period chose to
focus on more pressing social,
political, and ethical questions
that had more relevance to people’s
everyday lives. Thinkers in
postcolonial Africa such as Frantz
Fanon began to examine race,
identity, and the problems that
were inherent in any struggle for
liberation. Later thinkers, such as
Henry David Oruka, would begin
to amass a new history of African
philosophy, questioning the rules
governing philosophy itself, and
what it should include.

Continuing in the tradition of
Simone de Beauvoir’s existential
feminist philosophy, French
philosophers such as Hélène
Cixous and Luce Irigaray added
a postmodern perspective to
feminism, but other thinkers on
both sides of the Atlantic left
postmodernism completely to
one side. Some, such as American
philosopher John Rawls and
Germany’s Jürgen Habermas,
returned to examining important
everyday concepts in depth, such
as justice and communication.
The more practical approach to
philosophy in the 21st century has
led to a renewed public interest in
the subject. There is no way of
predicting what direction it will
take, but philosophy is certain to
continue to provide the world with
thought-provoking ideas. ■

are no characters, and there
is nothing in the way of a plot.
There are only the reﬂections
of a lover in what Barthes calls
“extreme solitude.”
At the very beginning of the
book, Barthes makes clear that a
plot is not possible, because the
solitary thoughts of a lover come in
outbursts that are often contradictory
and lack any clear order. As a lover,
Barthes suggests, I might even ﬁnd
myself plotting against myself. The
lover is somebody who might be

affectionately described as having
“lost the plot.” So instead of using
a plot, or narrative, Barthes arranges
his book like an extraordinary
encyclopaedia of contradictory and
disordered outbursts, any of which
might serve as the point the reader
might suddenly exclaim, “That’s so
true! I recognize that scene...”

The language of love
It is in this context that Barthes
suggests “language is a skin.”
Language, at least the language
of the lover, is not something that

simply talks about the world in a
neutral fashion, but it is something
that, as Barthes says, “trembles
with desire.” Barthes writes of how
“I rub my language against the
other. It is as if I had words instead
of ﬁngers, or ﬁngers at the tip of my
words.” Even if I write cool, detached
philosophy about love, Barthes
claims, there is buried in my
philosophical coolness a secret
address to a particular person, an
object of my desire, even if this
somebody is “a phantom or a
creature still to come.”
Barthes gives an example of this
secret address (although not, it
should be said, in the context of a
particularly detached philosophical
discussion) from Plato’s dialogue,
The Symposium. This is an account
of a discussion on the subject of
love that takes place in the house
of the poet Agathon. A statesman
called Alcibiades turns up to the
discussion both late and drunk, and
sits down on a couch with Agathon
and the philosopher Socrates. The
drunken speech he gives is full
of praise for Socrates, but it is

Agathon that Alcibiades desires; it
is against Agathon, so to speak, that
Alcibiades’ language is rubbing.
But what of the language that
we use when talking of other
things? Is only the lover’s language
a skin that trembles with hidden
desire, or is this also true of other
types of language? Barthes does
not tell us, leaving us to consider
the idea for ourselves. ■

Barthes was born in Cherbourg,
France, in 1915. He attended the
University of Sorbonne in Paris
from 1935, graduating in 1939,
but by this time he had already
contracted the tuberculosis that
would afﬂict him for the
remainder of his life. His illness
made it difﬁcult to acquire
teaching qualiﬁcations, but it
exempted him from military
service during World War II. After
the war, having ﬁnally qualiﬁed
as a teacher, he taught in France,
Romania, and Egypt. He returned
to live in France full time in 1952,
and there started to write the

pieces that were collected
together and published under
the title Mythologies in 1957.
Barthes’ reputation grew
steadily through the 1960s, in
France and internationally, and
he taught both at home and
abroad. He died at the age of 64,
when he was run over by
a laundry van after lunching
with President Mitterrand.

The lover’s language is like a skin,
says Barthes, which inhabits the lover.
Its words are able to move the
beloved—and only the beloved—in
an almost physical or tactile way.

One of the questions that she
tackles is that of the relationship
between nature and culture in
human life. Her concern is to
address the fact that many people
see nature and culture as somehow
opposed, as if culture is something
non-natural that is added onto

Midgley disagrees with the
idea that culture is something of
a wholly different order to nature.
Instead, she wants to argue that
culture is a natural phenomenon.
In other words, we have evolved to
be the kinds of creatures who have
cultures. It could be said that we
spin culture as naturally as spiders
spin webs. If this is so, then we
can no more do without culture
than a spider can do without its
web: our need for culture is both
innate and natural. In this way,
Midgley hopes both to account
for human uniqueness, and also
to put us in the larger context of
our evolutionary past. ■

Paradigm shifts
Science, in Kuhn’s view, alternates
between periods of “normal science”
and periods of “crisis.” Normal
science is the routine process by
which scientists working within
a theoretical framework—or
“paradigm”—accumulate results
that do not call the theoretical
underpinnings of their framework
into question. Sometimes, of
course, anomalous, or unfamiliar,
results are encountered, but these
are usually considered to be errors
on the part of the scientists
concerned—proof, according to
Kuhn, that normal science does
not aim at novelties. Over time,
however, anomalous results can

accumulate until a crisis point is
reached. Following the crisis, if a
new theory has been formulated,
there is a shift in the paradigm,
and the new theoretical framework
replaces the old. Eventually this
framework is taken for granted,
and normal science resumes—until
further anomalies arise. An example
of such a shift was the shattering
of the classical view of space and
time following the conﬁrmation of

I

n his book A Theory of Justice,
ﬁrst published in 1971, political
philosopher John Rawls argues
for a re-evaluation of justice in
terms of what he calls “justice as
fairness.” His approach falls into
the tradition known as social
contract theory, which sees the rule
of law as a form of contract that
individuals enter into because it
yields beneﬁts that exceed what
they can attain individually. Rawls’
version of this theory involves a
thought experiment in which people
are made ignorant of their place in
society, or placed in what he calls
the “original position” in which the

social contract is made. From this
Rawls establishes principles of
justice on which, he claims, all
rational beings should agree.

The original position
Imagine that a group of strangers is
marooned on a desert island, and
that, after giving up hope of being
rescued, they decide to start a new
society from scratch. Each of the
survivors wants to further their
own interests, but each also sees
that they can only do so by working
together in some way—in other
words, by forming a social contract.
The question is: how do they go

about establishing the principles
of justice? What rules do they lay
down? If they are interested in a
truly rational and impartial justice,
then there are countless rules that
have to be discounted immediately.
For example, the rule “If your name
is John, you must always eat last”,
is neither rational nor impartial,
even if it may be to your advantage
if your name is “John”.
In such a position, says Rawls,
what we need to do is cast a “veil
of ignorance” over all the facts of
our lives, such as who we are, and
where we were born, and then ask
what kind of rules it would be best
for us to live by. Rawls’ point
is that the only rules that could
rationally be agreed on by all

■

parties are ones that genuinely
honor impartiality, and don’t, for
example, take race, class, creed,
natural talent, or disability into
account. In other words, if I don’t
know what my place in society will
be, rational self-interest compels
me to vote for a world in which
everyone is treated fairly.

Rationality versus charity
It is important to note that for
Rawls this is not a story about how
justice has actually arisen in the
world. Instead, he gives us a way
of testing our theories of justice
against an impartial benchmark. If
they fail to measure up, his point is
that it is our reason, and not simply
our charity, that has failed. ■

The representation of
justice as a blindfolded
lady with a set of scales
expresses the idea that
no-one is above the law.

T

art, Richard Wollheim,
believes that we should
resist the tendency to see art as
an abstract idea that needs to be
analyzed and explained. If we are
to fully understand art, he believes,
we must always deﬁne it in relation
to its social context. By describing
art as a “form of life”, in Art and
its Objects (1968), he uses a term
coined by the Austrian-born
philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein
to describe the nature of language.
For Wittgenstein, language is a
“form of life”, because the way we
use it is always a reﬂection of our
individual experiences, habits, and
skills. He is attempting to resist the
tendency of philosophy to make
simplistic generalizations about
language and instead is pointing to
the many different roles language
plays in our lives.

Social setting
Wollheim is making the same point
as Wittgenstein, but in relation to
works of art. Artists, he states, are
conditioned by their context—their

dispositions, physical needs,
and communities—and the world
that they interpret is a world of
constant change. For Wollheim, one
implication of this is that there can
be no general “artistic impulse” or
instinct for the creation of art
that is totally independent of the
institutions in which it operates. ■

scientiﬁc progress is not gradual,
but always jumps in “paradigm

“anarchism” is rooted in the idea
that all of the methodologies used
in the sciences are limited in
scope. As a result, there is no such
thing as “scientiﬁc method.” If we
look at how science has developed
and progressed in practice, the only
“method” that we can discern is
that “anything goes.” Science,

When knowledge becomes data it is
no longer the indeﬁnable matter of
minds, but a commodity that can be
transferred, stored, bought, or sold.

but Lyotard’s deﬁnition is very
clear. Postmodernism, he writes,
is a matter of “incredulity towards
meta-narratives.” Meta-narratives
are overarching, single stories that
attempt to sum up the whole of
human history, or that attempt to
put all of our knowledge into a
single framework. Marxism (the
view that history can be seen as a
series of struggles between social
classes) is an example of a metanarrative. Another is the idea that
humanity’s story is one of progress
toward deeper knowledge and
social justice, brought about by
greater scientiﬁc understanding.

Externalized knowledge
Our incredulity toward these metanarratives implies a new scepticism.
Lyotard suggests that this is due to
a shift in the way we have related
to knowledge since World War II,
and to the huge change in the

Jean-François Lyotard

technologies we use to deal with
it. Computers have fundamentally
transformed our attitudes, as
knowledge has become information
that can be stored in databases,
moved to and fro, and bought and
sold. This is what Lyotard calls the
“mercantilization” of knowledge.
This has several implications.
The ﬁrst, Lyotard points out, is that
knowledge is becoming externalized.
It is no longer something that helps
toward the development of minds;
something that might be able to
transform us. Knowledge is also

becoming disconnected from
questions of truth. It is being judged
not in terms of how true it is, but in
terms of how well it serves certain
ends. When we cease to ask
questions about knowledge such
as “is it true?” and start asking
questions such as “how can this
be sold?”, knowledge becomes a
commodity. Lyotard is concerned
that once this happens, private
corporations may begin to seek to
control the ﬂow of knowledge, and
decide who can access what types
of knowledge, and when. ■

Jean-François Lyotard was born
in Versailles, France in 1924. He
studied philosophy and literature

revolution, but his philosophical
development ultimately led him

Fanon, this aspiration to achieve
“a white existence” not only fails
to address racism and inequality,
but it also masks or even condones
these things by implying that there
is an “unarguable superiority” to
white existence.
At the same time, Fanon is
saying something more complex.
It might be thought that, given this
tendency to aspire to a kind of
“white existence”, the solution would
be to argue for an independent view
of what it means to be black. Yet
this, too, is subject to all kinds of
problems. Elsewhere in his book,

Fanon writes that “the black man’s
soul is a white man’s artefact.” In
other words, the idea of what it
means to be black is the creation
of patterns of fundamentally racist
European thought.
Here Fanon is, in part, responding
to what was known in France as
the négritude (or “blackness”)
movement. This was a movement of
French and French-speaking black
writers from the 1930s who wanted
to reject the racism and colonialism
of mainstream French culture, and
argued for an independent, shared
black culture. But Fanon believes
that this idea of négritude is one
that fails to truly address the
problems of racism that it seeks to
overcome, because the way that it
thinks about “blackness” simply
repeats the fantasies of mainstream
white culture.

and has inﬂuenced social activists
such as anti-apartheid campaigner

rival forms of rhetoric, and instead
to look at history, at institutional
structures, at ofﬁcial policy
documents, and so forth.

Ethics and universality
Chomsky’s ethical analyses are
based on what he calls the
“principle of universality.” At root,
this principle is relatively simple.
It says that at the very least we
should apply to ourselves the same
standards that we apply to others.
This is a principle that Chomsky
claims has always been central to
any responsible system of ethics.
The central psychological insight
here is that we are fond of using
ethical language as a way of
protesting about others, but that we
are less inclined to pass judgment
on ourselves. Nevertheless, if we
claim to uphold any set of ethical or
moral standards, and if we wish to
be consistent, then we must apply
to others the standards we apply to
ourselves. In terms of government,
this means that we must analyze
our political actions rigorously,
instead of allowing ourselves to
be blinded by rhetoric.
This is both a moral and an
intellectual imperative. For Chomsky,
these are closely related. He points

out that if anyone making a moral
claim is also violating universality,
then their claim cannot be taken
seriously and should be rejected.
If we are to cut through the
rhetoric and examine political
morality in a rigorous fashion,
it seems that universality is a
necessary starting point. Some of
Chomsky’s speciﬁc claims about
the nature of global power have
caused considerable controversy,
but this does not invalidate his
central insight. For if we wish
to call his speciﬁc claims into
question, then we should do so in
the light of universality and of all
the available evidence. If his claims
turn out to be false, then they should
be rejected or modiﬁed; but if they
turn out to be true, then they
should be acted upon. ■

Chomsky was born in 1928
in Pennsylvania, USA, and
was raised in a multilingual
Jewish household. He studied
mathematics, philosophy, and

of Pennsylvania, where he

In 1957, his book Syntactic

ccording to the German
philosopher Jürgen
Habermas, modern society
depends not only on technological
advances, but also upon our ability
to criticize and reason collectively
about our own traditions. Reason,
says Habermas, lies at the heart
of our everyday communications.
Somebody says or does something,
and we say, “Why did you do that?”
or “Why did you say that?” We
continually ask for justiﬁcations,
which is why Habermas talks
about “communicative” reason.

Klein’s No Logo explores the

era dominated by advertising
and the mass media.

Coffee houses became a focus of
social and political life in the major cities
of 18th-century Europe. Noted as places
where “the dissaffected met”, attempts
were frequently made to close them.

Reason, for him, is not about
discovering abstract truths, but
about the need we have to justify
ourselves to others.

Creating a public sphere
In the 1960s and 1970s, Habermas
concluded that there was a link
between communicative reason
and what he calls the “public
sphere.” Up until the 18th century,
he states, European culture was
largely “representational”, meaning
that the ruling classes sought to
“represent” themselves to their
subjects with displays of power
that required no justiﬁcation, such
as impressive pageants or grand
architectural projects. But in the
18th century, a variety of public
spaces emerged that were outside
state control, including literary
salons and coffee houses. These
were places where individuals could
gather to engage in conversation or
reasoned debate. This growth of
the public sphere led to increased
opportunities to question the
authority of representational state
culture. The public sphere became
a “third space”, a buffer between
the private space of our immediate
friends and family, and the space
occupied by state control.

By establishing a public sphere, we
also open up more opportunities for
recognizing that we have interests
in common with other private
individuals—interests that the
state may fail to serve. This can
lead to questioning the actions of
the state. Habermas believes that
the growth of the public sphere
helped to trigger the French
Revolution in 1789.
The expansion of the public
sphere, from the 18th century
onward, has led to a growth of
democratically elected political
institutions, independent courts,
and bills of rights. But Habermas
believes that many of these brakes
on the arbitrary use of power are
now under threat. Newspapers, for
example, can offer opportunities
for reasoned dialogue between
private individuals, but if the press
is controlled by large corporations,
such opportunities may diminish.
Informed debate on issues of
substance is replaced with
celebrity gossip, and we are
transformed from critical, rational
agents into mindless consumers. ■

Jürgen Habermas grew up in
Germany under the Nazi regime.
His realization that “we had been
living in a criminal system”,
following the Nuremburg trials
(1945–46), was to have a lasting
effect on his philosophy.
On completing his doctorate in

Simon Critchley’s Ethics of
Deconstruction explores
aspects of Derrida’s work.

J

acques Derrida remains one
of the most controversial
20th-century philosophers.
His name is associated, ﬁrst and
foremost, with “deconstruction”,
a complex and nuanced approach
to how we read and understand the
nature of written texts. If we are to
understand what Derrida means
when he says in his famous book
Of Grammatology that there is
nothing outside of the text (the
original French is “il n’y a pas de
hors-texte”, also translated as
“there is no outside-text”), we need
to take a closer look at Derrida’s
deconstructive approach in general.

We are all mediators,
translators.
Jacques Derrida

Often when we pick up a book,
whether a philosophy book or a
novel, we imagine that what we
have in our hands is something
that we can understand or interpret
as a relatively self-contained whole.
When it comes to philosophical
texts, we might be expected to
imagine that these are especially
systematic and logical. Imagine
that you go into a bookshop and
pick up a copy of Of Grammatology.
You would think that, if you were to
read the book, by the end of it you
would have a reasonable grasp of
what “grammatology” itself might
be, what Derrida’s main ideas were
on the subject, and what this said
about the world. But, for Derrida,
texts do not work in this way.

Derrida aims to broaden our
understanding of what texts are
and what they do, and to show the
complexity that lies behind even
the most apparently simple works.
Deconstruction is a way of reading
texts to bring these hidden
paradoxes and contradictions out
into the open. This is not, however,
just a matter of how we read
philosophy and literature; there are
much broader implications to
Derrida’s approach that bring into
question the relationship between
language, thought, and even ethics.
At this point, it would help to
introduce an important technical
term from Derrida’s vocabulary:
“différance.” This may look like a
typographical error—and indeed,
when the term différance ﬁrst
entered the French dictionary, the
story goes that even Derrida’s
mother sternly said to him, “But
Jacques, that is not how you spell
it!” But in fact différance is a word
that Derrida coined himself to point
to a curious aspect of language.
“Différance” (with an “a”) is a
play both on the French “différence”
(with an “e”), meaning “to differ”,
and the French “deférrer” meaning
“to defer.” To understand how this

Aporia and différance
Even the most straightforward
texts (and Of Grammatology is not
one such text) are riddled with
what Derrida calls “aporias”. The
word “aporia” comes from the
Ancient Greek, where it means
something like “contradiction”,
“puzzle”, or “impasse.” For Derrida,
all written texts have such gaps,
holes, and contradictions and his
method of deconstruction is a way
of reading texts while looking out
for these puzzles and impasses. In
exploring these contradictions as
they appear in different texts,

A typesetter can check plates of type
closely before they are printed, but the
ideas they express are full of “aporias”,
or contradictions, says Derrida, which
no amount of analysis can eliminate.

I try to explain what Derrida
means when he says that “there
is nothing outside of the text.”

But I can never completely
explain the idea because…

The meaning of what we write is,
for Derrida, changed by what we write
next. Even the deceptively simple act
of writing a letter can lead to a deferral
of meaning in the text itself.

word works, it would be useful to
consider how this deferring and
differing might actually take place
in practice. Let us start with
deferring. Imagine that I say “The
cat…”, then I add, “that my friend
saw…”. After a pause, I say, “in the
garden was black and white…”,
and so on. The precise meaning of
the word “cat” as I am using it is
continually deferred, or put off, as
more information is given. If I had
been cut off after saying “The cat…”
and had not mentioned my friend
or the garden, the meaning of “cat”
would have been different. The
more I add to what I say, in other
words, the more the meaning of
what I have already said is revised.
Meaning is deferred in language.
But there is something else
going on as well. The meaning of
“cat”, Derrida believes, cannot be
considered as something that rests
in the relationship between my
words and actual things in the
world. The word takes its ❯❯

…the meaning of
what I say depends on
what I (or others) go
on to say later.

…the meaning of the
words I use depends
on their relationship
to the words I am
not using.

So meaning is
always incomplete.

So I say more to
clarify things.

In this way, my explanation
of Derrida’s idea can
grow until it is inﬁnitely
large, and I realize...

…there is
nothing outside
of the text.

312 JACQUES DERRIDA

We think only in signs.
Jacques Derrida

meaning from its position in a whole
system of language. So when I say
“cat”, this is meaningful not because
of some mysterious link between
the word and an actual cat, but
because this term differs from, for
example, “dog” or “lion” or “zebra.”
Taken together, these two
ideas of deferring and differing
say something quite strange about
language in general. On the one
hand, the meaning of anything we
say is ultimately always deferred,
because it depends on what else
we say; and the meaning of that,
in turn, depends on what else we
say, and so on. And on the other
hand, the meaning of any particular
term we use depends on all the
things that we don’t mean. So
meaning is not self-contained
within the text itself.

The written word
For Derrida, différance is an aspect
of language that we become aware
of thanks to writing. Since ancient
Greek times, philosophers have
been suspicious of written
language. In Plato’s dialogue, the
Phaedrus, Socrates tells a legend
about the invention of writing, and
says that writing provides only “the
appearance of wisdom” and not its
reality. Writing, when philosophers
have thought about it at all, has
tended to be seen simply as a pale
reﬂection of the spoken word; the

latter has been taken as the primary
means of communication. Derrida
wants to reverse this; according to
him, the written word shows us
something about language that the
spoken word does not.
The traditional emphasis on
speech as a means of transmitting
philosophical ideas has fooled us
all, Derrida believes, into thinking
that we have immediate access to
meaning. We think that meaning is
about “presence”—when we speak
with another person, we imagine
that they make their thoughts
“present” for us, and that we are
doing the same for them. If there is
any confusion, we ask the other
person to clarify. And if there are
any puzzles, or aporias, we either
ask for clariﬁcation, or these simply
slide past us without our noticing.
This leads us to think that meaning
in general is about presence—to
think, for example, that the real
meaning of “cat” can be found in
the presence of a cat on my lap.
But when we deal with a
written text, we are freed from this
naïve belief in presence. Without
the author there to make their
excuses and explain for us, we start
to notice the complexities and the

puzzles and the impasses. All of a
sudden, language begins to look
a little more complicated.

Questioning meaning
When Derrida says that there is
nothing outside of the text, he does
not mean that all that matters is the
world of books, that somehow the
world “of ﬂesh and bone” does not
matter. Nor is he trying to play
down the importance of any social
concerns that might lie behind the
text. So what exactly is he saying?
First, Derrida is suggesting that
if we take seriously the idea that
meaning is a matter of différance,
of differing and of deferring, then
if we want to engage with the
question of how we ought think
about the world, we must always
keep alive to the fact that meaning
is never as straightforward as we
think it is, and that this meaning
is always open to being examined
by deconstruction.
Second, Derrida is suggesting
that in our thinking, our writing,
and our speaking, we are always
implicated in all manner of political,
historical, and ethical questions
that we may not even recognize or
acknowledge. For this reason, some

Derrida’s own thesis that there is nothing
outside of the text is open to be analyzed
using his own deconstructive methods.
Even the idea as explained in this book
is subject to différance.

CONTEMPORARY PHILOSOPHY 313

Jacques Derrida

Derrida registered his opposition
to the Vietnam War in a lecture given
in the US in 1968. His involvement in
numerous political issues and debates
informed much of his later work.

philosophers have suggested that
deconstruction is essentially an
ethical practice. In reading a text
deconstructively, we call into
question the claims that it is
making, and we open up difﬁcult
ethical issues that may have
remained hidden. Certainly in
his later life, Derrida turned his
attention to some of the very real
ethical puzzles and contradictions
that are raised by ideas such as
“hospitality” and “forgiveness.”

latter’s response to this, perhaps,
might be to say that the idea of
having a thesis is itself based on
the idea of “presence” that he is
attempting to call into question.
This may seem like dodging the
issue; but if we take Derrida’s idea
seriously, then we have to admit
that the idea that there is nothing
outside of the text is itself not
outside of the text. To take this
idea seriously, then, is to treat it
sceptically, to deconstruct it, and
to explore the puzzles, impasses,
and contradictions that—according
to Derrida himself—lurk within it. ■

Critics of Derrida
Given that Derrida’s idea is based
on the notion that meaning can
never be completely present in the
text, it is perhaps not surprising
that Derrida’s work can often be
difﬁcult. Michel Foucault, one of
Derrida’s contemporaries, attacked
Derrida’s thinking for being wilfully
obscure; he protested that often it
was impossible to say exactly what
Derrida’s thesis actually was. The

Even if we cannot say
much about our souls or
describe what a soul is like, many
of us nonetheless hold ﬁrmly to
the belief that, somewhere deep
down, we each have such a thing.
Not only this, we might claim that
this thing is the fundamental self
(“me”) and, at the same time, is
somehow connected directly with
the truth or reality.
The tendency to picture
ourselves as possessing a kind of
“double”—a soul or a deep self that
“uses Reality’s own language”—is
explored by American philosopher
Richard Rorty in the introduction
to his book, The Consequences of
Pragmatism (1982). Rorty argues
that, to the extent that we have
such a thing at all, a soul is a
human invention; it is something
that we have put there ourselves.

Knowledge as a mirror
Rorty was a philosopher who worked
within the American tradition of
pragmatism. In considering a
statement, most philosophical
traditions ask “is this true?” , in
the sense of: “does this correctly
represent the way things are?”. But

Some theories of knowledge claim that we gain
knowledge by processing “raw data” like a camera
captures light, but Rorty says our perceptions
are tangled up with our beliefs, which we
impose on things in the world.

Philosophy makes
progress not by becoming
more rigorous but by
becoming more imaginative.
Richard Rorty

pragmatists consider statements in
quite a different way, asking instead:
“what are the practical implications
of accepting this as true?”
Rorty’s ﬁrst major book,
Philosophy and the Mirror of
Nature, published in 1979, was an
attempt to argue against the idea
that knowledge is a matter of
correctly representing the world,
like some kind of mental mirror.
Rorty argues that this view of
knowledge cannot be upheld, for
two reasons. First, we assume that
our experience of the world is
directly “given” to us—we assume
that what we experience is the raw

■

data of how the world is. Second,
we assume that once this raw data
has been collected, our reason (or
some other faculty of mind) then
starts to work on it, reconstructing
how this knowledge ﬁts together
as a whole, and mirroring what is
in the world.
Rorty follows the philosopher
Wilfrid Sellars in claiming that
the idea of experience as “given”
is a myth. We cannot ever access
anything like raw data—it is not
possible for us to experience a dog,
for instance, outside of thought or
language. We only become aware of
something through conceptualizing
it, and our concepts are learned
through language. Our perceptions
are therefore inextricably tangled up
with the habitual ways that we use
language to divide up the world.
Rorty suggests that knowledge
is not so much a way of mirroring
nature as “a matter of conversation
and social practice.” When we
decide what counts as knowledge,
our judgement rests not on how
strongly a “fact” correlates to the
world, so much as whether it is
something “that society lets us
say.” What we can and cannot
count as knowledge is therefore
limited by the social contexts that
we live in, by our histories, and by
what those around us will allow us
to claim. “Truth,” said Rorty, “is
what your contemporaries let you
get away with saying.”

What sort of a world can
we prepare for our
great-grandchildren?
Richard Rorty

Using children as soldiers may seem
intrinsically wrong, but Rorty says there
are no ethical absolutes. Ethics is a
matter of doing our best, in solidarity
with others, to realize a better world.

subject it to all manner of cruel
tortures, simply for the fun of
hearing it squeak. We might all
agree that doing such a thing to the
poor hamster (or, for that matter,
doing such a thing to my neighbor)
is a morally blameable act. We
might claim that there is something
absolutely and fundamentally
wrong about doing such a thing to
another living being; and we might
all agree that we ought not let other
people get away with such things.
But when we look at the reasons
that we give for saying that this is
a morally blameable act, things
become interesting. For example,
imagine that you are asked by
a particularly awkward moral
philosopher why it is wrong to treat
hamsters (or horses, or humans)
in this way. At ﬁrst you might
suggest all manner of reasons. But
philosophy being what it is, and

moral philosophers being the kinds
of beings they are, you might ﬁnd
that for every reason you can think
of, your philosopher friend has a
counter-reason or leads you into
some kind of contradiction.
This is, in fact, precisely what
the philosopher Socrates did in
ancient Athens. Socrates wanted
to ﬁnd out what concepts such as
“goodness” and “justice” really
were, so he questioned people who
used these concepts, to ﬁnd out
whether they really knew what
these things were. As the dialogues
of Plato show, most of the people
Socrates talked to were surprisingly
unclear about what it was they
were actually talking about, despite
their earlier conviction that they
fully grasped the relevant concepts.
In the same way, after an hour or
two of being interrogated by a
modern-day Socrates about how
to treat hamsters, you might blurt
out in frustration the following
sentence: “But I just know, in my
heart of hearts, that it is wrong!”

My heart of hearts
We say or think this kind of thing
relatively frequently, but it is not
immediately clear what exactly we
mean. To examine the idea more
closely, we can break it down into
three parts. First, it seems that

when we say “I know, in my heart
of hearts, that it is wrong”, we are
speaking as if there is something
out there in the world that is
“wrongness”, and that this thing is
knowable. Or, as some philosophers
put it, we are speaking as if there
is an essence of “wrongness” to
which this particular instance
of wrongness corresponds.
Second, by saying that we just
“know” in our heart of hearts, we
imply that this mysterious entity
—our “heart of hearts”—is a thing
that, for reasons unknown, has a
particular grasp of truth.
Third, we seem to be speaking
as if there is a straightforward
relationship between our “heart
of hearts” and this “wrongness”
that lies out there in the world,
such that if we know something
in our heart of hearts, we can have
access to an absolutely certain kind
of knowledge. In other words, this
is just another version of the idea
that knowledge is a way of mirroring
the world. And this, Rorty believes,
is unacceptable.

A world without absolutes
In order for his beliefs to be
consistent, Rorty has to give up
on the idea of fundamental moral
truths. There can be no absolute
right or wrong if knowledge is

“what society lets us say.” Rorty
recognizes that this is a difﬁcult
thing to accept. But is it necessary
to believe that on doing something
morally wrong you are betraying
something deep within you? Must
you believe that there is “some
truth about life, or some absolute
moral law, that you are violating”
in order to maintain even a shred of
human decency? Rorty thinks not.
He maintains that we are ﬁnite
beings, whose existence is limited
to a short time on Earth, and none
of us have a hotline to some deeper,
more fundamental moral truth.
However, this does not imply that
the problems of life have either

gone away or ceased to matter.
These problems are still with us,
and in the absence of absolute
moral laws we are thrown back
upon our own resources. We are
left, Rorty writes, with “our loyalty
to other human beings clinging
together against the dark.” There
is no absolute sense of rightness
and wrongness to be discovered.
So we simply have to hold on to
our hopes and loyalties, and
continue to participate in involved
conversations in which we talk
about these difﬁcult issues.
Perhaps, Rorty is saying, these
things are enough: the humility
that comes from recognizing that
there is no absolute standard of
truth; the solidarity we have with
others; and our hopes that we may
be able to contribute to, and to
bequeath to those who come after
us, a world that is worth living in. ■

Richard Rorty
Richard Rorty was born in
New York, USA in 1931. His
parents were political activists,
and Rorty describes his early
years as being spent reading
about Leon Trotsky, the
Russian revolutionary. He said
that he knew by the age of 12
that “the point of being human
was to spend one’s life ﬁghting
social injustice.” He began
attending the University of
Chicago early, at the age of 15,
going on to take a PhD at Yale
in 1956. He was then drafted
into the army for two years,
before becoming a professor.
He wrote his most important
book, Philosophy and the
Mirror of Nature, while
professor of philosophy at
Princeton. He wrote widely
on philosophy, literature, and
politics and, unusually for a
20th-century philosopher, drew
on both the so-called analytic
and the continental traditions.
Rorty died of cancer aged 75.

speaking and desiring that are
free from male-centeredness.

Wisdom and desire
To address this problem, Irigaray
suggests that all thinking—even
the most apparently sober and
objective-sounding philosophy,
with its talk of wisdom, certainty,
rectitude, and moderation—is
underpinned by desire. In failing
to acknowledge the desire that
underpins it, traditional malecentered philosophy has also failed
to acknowledge that beneath its
apparent rationality simmer all
manner of irrational impulses.
Irigaray suggests that each sex
has its own relationship to desire,
and as a result each sex has a
relation to madness. This calls
into question the long tradition
of equating maleness with this
rationality, and femaleness with
irrationality. It also opens the
way to the possibility of new
ways of writing and thinking
about philosophy, for both men
and women. ■

ulgarian-born philosopher

Kristeva is often regarded
as one of the leading voices in
French feminism. Nevertheless,
the question of whether, or in what
way, Kristeva is a feminist thinker
has been subject to considerable
debate. Part of the reason for this
is that for Kristeva herself, the very
notion of feminism is problematic.
Feminism has arisen out of the
conﬂict women have had with
the structures that are associated
with male dominance or power.
Because of these roots, Kristeva
warns, feminism carries with it
some of the same male-centered
presuppositions that it is seeking
to question.
If the feminist movement is
to realize its goals fully, Kristeva
believes that it is essential for it to
be more self-critical. She warns
that by seeking to ﬁght what she
calls the “power principle” of a
male-dominated world, feminism
is at risk of adopting yet another
form of this principle. Kristeva is
convinced that for any movement

to be successful in achieving true
emancipation, it must constantly
question its relationship to power
and established social systems—
and, if necessary “renounce belief
in its own identity.” If the feminist
movement fails to take these steps,
Kristeva fears that it is in serious
danger of developing into little
more than an additional strand
in the ongoing game of power. ■

hough the ideas already presented in this book show the broad
range of philosophical thought expressed by some of history’s
best minds, there are many more people who have helped to shape
the story of philosophy. Some of these thinkers—such as Empedocles,
Plotinus, or William of Ockham—have had ideas that form the starting
point for other, more well-known theories, and their inﬂuence on later
philosophers is clear. Some, such as Friedrich Schelling or Gilles Deleuze,
have taken the works of previous philosophers and added an interesting
twist that sheds new light on the subject. Whatever their relationship is
to the history of philosophy, the people discussed below have all helped
to broaden the boundaries of philosophical thought.

ANAXIMANDER
c.610–546 BCE

Born in Miletus, in what is now
southwest Turkey, Anaximander
was a pupil of Thales, the “father”
of Western philosophy. Like Thales,
he thought there was a single basic
substance from which everything
had evolved. He decided it must be
inﬁnite and eternal and called it
apeiron (“indeﬁnite”). Anaximander
also challenged Thales’ suggestion
that Earth was supported by a sea
of water, reasoning that this sea
would have to be supported by
something else. Lacking evidence
for this supporting structure, he
declared that Earth was an object
hanging in space. He went on to
publish what is believed to be
the ﬁrst map of the world.
See also: Thales of Miletus 22–23

ANAXIMENES OF MILETUS
c.585–528 BCE

Like other Milesian philosophers,
Anaximenes searched for the
fundamental material from which

the universe was made. He opted
for air, pointing out that just as air
gives life to the human body, so
a universal kind of air gives life
to the cosmos. He was the ﬁrst
thinker on record to use observed
evidence to support his ideas.
Blowing with pursed lips produced
cold air; with relaxed lips, warm
air. He argued, therefore, that
when something condenses, it
cools; when it expands it heats up.
Likewise, when air condenses, it
becomes visible; ﬁrst as mist, then
as rain, and ultimately, he believed,
as rock, thus giving birth to Earth.
See also: Thales of Miletus 22–23

ANAXAGORAS
c.500–428 BCE

Born in Ionia, off the southern coast
of present-day Turkey, Anaxagoras
played a key role in making Athens
the world center of philosophy and
scientiﬁc enquiry. Central to his
thinking were his views on the
material world and cosmology. He
reasoned that everything in the
material world was made up of a
small part of everything else,

otherwise it could not have come
into being. Sentenced to death for
impiety after insisting that the sun
was a ﬁery rock, he ﬂed Athens and
spent his ﬁnal years in exile.

c.490–430 BCE

Empedocles was a member of a
high-ranking political family in
the then-Greek colony of Sicily.
His knowledge of the natural world
led to him being credited with
miraculous powers, such as the
ability to cure diseases and control
the weather. He reasserted the
notion of Heraclitus that we live
in an ever-changing world, as
opposed to Parmenides’ theory
that everything is ultimately one
ﬁxed entity. He believed that four
elements—ﬁre, water, earth, and
air—continually combine, move
apart, and recombine in a ﬁnite
number of ways. This idea remained
part of Western thinking up until
the Renaissance period.

ZENO OF ELEA

PLOTINUS

IAMBLICHUS

Little is known about Zeno of Elea,
other than his paradoxes of motion,
which are mentioned by Aristotle.
Zeno is thought to have produced
more than 40 of these, although only
a few survive. In them, he defended
the claim of his teacher Parmenides
that the changing and varied
world we perceive around us is not
reality—which is in fact motionless,
uniform, and simple. Movement,
Zeno believed, is an illusion of the
senses. Each of his paradoxes
began from the position that he
wished to refute—that movement,
and hence change, is real—then
continued by revealing the
contradictory consequences that
lead to the rejection of this notion.

Parmenides 41 Aristotle 56–63

Born in Egypt, Plotinus studied
in Alexandria, then considered
the intellectual hub of the world.
He later moved to Rome, where he
taught his own brand of Platonism,
known as Neo-Platonism. Plotinus
divided the cosmos into layers, with
the indeﬁnable source of all being
—the “One”—at the top, followed
by Mind, Soul, Nature, and ﬁnally
the Material World. He believed in
reincarnation and the immortality
of the soul; by striving for
enlightenment individuals could
achieve mystical union with the
“One”, and so escape the cycle of
rebirth. His ideas, presented in the
Enneads, were widely inﬂuential,
particularly those that supported
Christianity, which was taking root
in the Roman Empire at the time.

A Syrian Neo-Platonist philosopher,
Iamblichus was reputedly born into
an inﬂuential aristocratic family.
He founded a school near modernday Antioch, where he taught a
curriculum based mainly on
the ideas of Plato and Aristotle,
although he is best known for
his expansion of the theories of
Pythagoras, which he recorded
in his Collection of Pythagorean
Doctrines. Iamblichus introduced
the concept of the soul being
embodied in matter, both of which
he believed to be divine. Salvation,
or the return of the soul to its pure
immortal form, he stated, was
achieved through the performance
of speciﬁc religious rituals, and not
just the contemplation of abstract
ideas alone.

WANG BI

HYPATIA OF ALEXANDRIA

In 220 CE, the ruling Chinese Han
Dynasty collapsed, heralding an
era of moral confusion. Philosopher
Wang Bi helped to bring order to
this chaos by reconciling two
dominant schools of thought. He
argued that Daoist texts should
not be read literally, but more
like works of poetry, thus making
them compatible with the highly
practical Confucian ideals of
political and moral wisdom. His
fresh appraisals of Daoism and
Confucianism ensured the survival
of both, and paved the way for the
spread of Buddhism across China.

Hypatia taught mathematics,
astronomy, and philosophy at the
Museum of Alexandria, eventually
succeeding her father as its head.
Although she was an esteemed
Neo-Platonist intellectual and the
ﬁrst notable female mathematician,
it was her martyrdom that ensured
her fame. She was murdered by a
Christian mob, who blamed her for
the religious turmoil resulting from
conﬂict between her friend, the
Roman prefect Orestos, and Cyril,
Bishop of Alexandria. No works of
hers survive, but she is credited
with inventing a graduated brass
hydrometer and the plane astrolabe.

Pyrrho treated the suspension of

both sides of any argument can
seem to be equally valid. Pyrrho left
no writings, but he did inspire the
Skeptical school in ancient Greek

AL-KINDI

AL-FARABI

Born in Constantinople, Proclus
succeeded his Platonist teacher
Syrianus as head of the Academy
at Athens. His Commentary on
Euclid is the main account of
the early development of Greek
geometry, and his Commentary on
Plato’s Timaeus has been described
as the most important ancient
Neo-Platonist text. A scientist,
mathematician, lawyer, and
poet, with a deep interest in
religion, he was to become an
inﬂuence on many thinkers in
both the medieval Islamic and the
Christian schools of philosophy.

The Iraqi polymath Al-Kindî was
one of the ﬁrst Islamic scholars to
introduce ancient Greek ideas to
the Islamic world. He worked at
Baghdad’s House of Wisdom, where
he supervised the translation of the
great Classical texts into Arabic.
He wrote extensively on a variety of
subjects, most notably psychology
and cosmology, mixing his own
Neo-Platonist approach with the
authority of Aristotelian argument.
He had a special interest in the
compatibility of philosophy and
Islamic theology, and many of his
works are concerned with the
nature of God and the human soul,
as well as prophetic knowledge.

It is disputed whether Al-Fârâbî
was born in what is now Iran or in
Kazakhstan, but it is certain that
he arrived in Baghdad in 901,
where he spent much of his life.
Although a Neo-Platonist, he was
also highly inﬂuenced by Aristotle
and wrote commentaries on his
work, as well as on other subjects,
including medicine, science, and
music. He regarded philosophy as
a calling conferred by Allah and as
the only route to true knowledge.
In this life, he said, philosophers
have a duty to guide people in all
matters of daily life; his book The
Ideas of the Citizens of the Virtuous
City describes a Platonic utopia

A philosopher and natural scientist,
Philoponus’s methods of enquiry
were shaped by Christian beliefs.
By arguing that the universe had an
absolute beginning, and that this
beginning was caused by God, he
became the ﬁrst serious critic of
Aristotle, opening up paths of
enquiry which became major
inﬂuences on future scientists,
notably the Italian astronomer
Galileo Galilei. Unpopular with

ERIUGENA

AL-GHAZALI

His Latin name is often translated
as John the Scot, but the theologian
and philosopher Johannes Scotus
Eriugena was Irish—the medieval
Latin for Ireland being “Scotia”. He
argued that there was no conﬂict
between knowledge that was
derived from reason and knowledge
from divine revelation. He even set
out to demonstrate that all Christian
doctrine had in fact a rational basis.
This brought him into conﬂict with
the Church, on the grounds that his
theories made both revelation and
faith redundant. Eruigena’s defense
was that reason is the judge of all
authority, and that it is needed for
us to interpret revelation.

great respect and wealth, but after
concluding that truth comes from

He came to believe that all causal

attended the Cathedral School of
Nôtre Dame, Paris, and became a
charismatic teacher. By the age of
22, he had set up his own school,
and went on to become head at
Nôtre Dame in 1115. Renowned for

Averroes. He set out to show the
compatibility between reason

to true knowledge, and therefore
enlightenment and a link with the

The child of a poor English peasant
family, Grosseteste’s formidable
intelligence was spotted by the
Mayor of Lincoln, who arranged
for him to be educated. Evidence
indicates that he studied at Oxford
University and in Paris, before
joining the clergy and going on
to become Bishop of Lincoln. An
outspoken critic of the Church
in his time, Grosseteste is noted
for his scientiﬁc thinking. He
was one of the ﬁrst medieval
philosophers to grasp Aristotle’s
dual path of scientiﬁc reasoning:
generalizing from particular
observations into a universal law,
and then back again from universal
laws to the prediction of particulars.

Educated at the Majorcan royal
court in Mallorca, Llull developed a
mystical version of Neo-Platonism.
After a vision of Christ, he joined
the Franciscan order and worked
as a missionary in North Africa.
Convinced that rational argument
could persuade Muslims and Jews
to convert to Christianity, Llull
wrote Ars Magna. In this work, he
used complex reasoning to generate
different combinations of the basic
tenets of all monotheistic religions,
hoping to demonstrate the truths of

developed. Finally, there came the

saw as emerging at the time he

where he had access to the vast
collection of studies on tribal
cultures and myths in the Warburg
Library. These were to inform his
major work The Philosophy of
Symbolic Forms (1923–29), in which
he incorporated mythical thinking
into a philosophical system similar
to Immanuel Kant’s. In 1933, Cassirer
ﬂed Europe to escape the rise of
Nazism, continuing his work in
America, and later Sweden.

ERNST BLOCH
A German Marxist philosopher,
Ernst Bloch’s work focuses on the
possibility of a humanistic utopian
world, free of exploitation and
oppression. During World War I
he took refuge from the conﬂict in
Switzerland, and in 1933 ﬂed the
Nazis, ending up in the United
States. Here he began his key
work, The Principle of Hope (1947).
After World War II, Bloch taught in
Leipzig—but with the building of
the Berlin Wall in 1961, he sought
asylum in West Germany. Although
he was an atheist, Bloch believed
that religion’s mystical vision of
heaven on earth is attainable.

GILBERT RYLE
1900–1976

Born in Brighton on the south coast
of England, Gilbert Ryle studied
and taught at Oxford University. He
believed that many problems in
philosophy arise from the abuse of
language. He showed that we often
assume expressions that function
in a similar way grammatically are
members of the same logical
category. Such “category mistakes”,

Michael Oakeshott was a British
political theorist and philosopher.
He taught at Cambridge and Oxford
universities, before becoming
Professor of Political Science at the
London School of Economics. Works
such as On Being Conservative
(1956) and Rationalism in Politics and
Other Essays (1962) cemented his
fame as a political theorist. He
had an important inﬂuence on
Conservative party politics in the
late 20th century. However, since
he frequently revised his opinions,
his work deﬁes categorization.

JOHN LANGSHAW AUSTIN

LOUIS ALTHUSSER

RENE GIRARD

Educated at Oxford University,
where he also taught, the British
philosopher John Langshaw Austin
was a leading ﬁgure in “ordinary
language” or “Oxford” philosophy,
which became fashionable in the
1950s. Austin argued that rigorous
analysis of how language operates
in ordinary everyday usage can
lead to the discovery of the subtle
linguistic distinctions needed to
resolve profound philosophical
problems. He is best known from
his papers and lectures that were
published after his death as How
to do Things with Words (1962) and
Sense and Sensibilia (1964).

236–39 Gilbert Ryle 337

Born in Algeria, the French Marxist
scholar Louis Althusser argued
that there is a radical difference
between Marx’s early writings and
the “scientiﬁc” period of Capital
(Das Kapital). The early works of
Marx reﬂect the times with their
focus on Hegelian concepts such as
alienation, whereas in the mature
work, history is seen as having its
own momentum, independent of
the intentions and actions of human
agents. Therefore Althusser’s claim
that we are determined by the
structural conditions of society
involves the controversial rejection
of human autonomy, denying
individual agency a role in history.

The French philosopher and
historian René Girard writes and
teaches across a wide range of
subjects, from economics to literary
criticism. He is best known for his
theory of mimetic desire. In Deceit,
Desire and the Novel (1961), Girard
uses ancient mythology and modern
ﬁction to show that human desire,
as distinct from animal appetite, is
always aroused by the desire of
another. His study of the origins of
violence, Violence and the Sacred
(1972), goes further by arguing
that this imitated desire leads to
conﬂict and violence. Religion,
Girard states, originated with the
process of victimization or sacriﬁce
that was used to quell the violence.

The American philosopher Donald
Davidson studied at Harvard and
went on to a distinguished career
teaching at various American
universities. He was involved in
several areas of philosophy, notably
the philosophy of mind. He held a
materialist position, stating that
each token mental event was also
a physical event, although he did
not believe that the mental could be
entirely reduced to, or explained in
terms of, the physical. Davidson
also made notable contributions to
the philosophy of language, arguing
that a language must have a ﬁnite
number of elements and that its
meaning is a product of these
elements and rules of combination.

The French philosopher Edgar
Morin was born in Paris, the son of
Jewish immigrants from Greece.
His positive view of the progress of
Western civilization is tempered by
what he perceives as the negative
effects of technical and scientiﬁc
advances. Progress may create
wealth but also seems to bring with
it a breakdown of responsibility and
global awareness. Morin developed
what became known as “complex
thought” and coined the term
“politics of civilization.” His sixvolume Method (1977–2004) is a
compendium of his thoughts and
ideas, offering a broad insight into
the nature of human enquiry.

Gilles Deleuze was born in Paris
and spent most of his life there.
He saw philosophy as a creative
process for constructing concepts,
rather than an attempt to discover
and reﬂect reality. Much of his work
was in the history of philosophy,
yet his readings did not attempt to
disclose the “true” Nietzsche, for
example. Instead they rework the
conceptual mechanisms of a
philosopher’s subject to produce
new ideas, opening up new avenues
of thought. Deleuze is also known for
collaborations with psychoanalyst
Félix Guattari—Anti-Oedipus (1972)
and What is Philosophy (1991)—and
for his commentaries on literature,
ﬁlm, and art.

sociology in America. He went
on to become one of the most
important and proliﬁc social

Luhmann developed a grand

enquiries take the form of “maps”,
where the journeys themselves
play an major role. He has been
described as a “thinker for whom

GLOSSARY
the Absolute Ultimate reality
conceived of as an all-embracing,
single principle. Some thinkers
have identiﬁed this principle with
God; others have believed in the
Absolute but not in God; others
have not believed in either. The
philosopher most closely associated
with the idea is Georg Hegel.
Aesthetics A branch of philosophy
concerned with the principles of art
and the notion of beauty.
Agent The doing self, as distinct
from the knowing self; the self that
decides or chooses or acts.
Analysis The search for a deeper
understanding of something by
taking it to pieces and looking at
each part. The opposite approach
is synthesis.
Analytic philosophy A view of
philosophy that sees its aim as
clariﬁcation—the clariﬁcation of
concepts, statements, methods,
arguments, and theories by
carefully taking them apart.
Analytic statement A statement
whose truth or falsehood can be
established by analysis of the
statement itself. The opposite is
a synthetic statement.
Anthropomorphism The
attribution of human characteristics
to something that is not human; for
instance to God or to the weather.

A posteriori Something that can
be considered valid only by means
of experience.

A priori Something known to be
valid in advance of (or without
need of) experience.
Argument A process of reasoning
in logic that purports to show its
conclusion to be true.
Category The broadest class or
group into which things can be
divided. Aristotle and Immanuel
Kant both tried to provide a
complete list of categories.
Concept A thought or idea; the
meaning of a word or term.
Contingent May or may not be the
case; things could be either way.
The opposite is necessary.
Contradictory Two statements
are contradictory if one must be
true and the other false: they
cannot both be true, nor can they
both be false.
Contrary Two statements are
contrary if they cannot both be
true but may both be false.
Corroboration Evidence that
lends support to a conclusion
without necessarily proving it.
Cosmology The study of the whole
universe, the cosmos.
Deduction Reasoning from the
general to the particular—for
instance, “If all men are mortal then
Socrates, being a man, must be
mortal.” It is universally agreed that
deduction is valid. The opposite
process is called induction.

Determinism The view that
nothing can happen other than
what does happen, because every
event is the necessary outcome
of causes preceding it—which
themselves were the necessary
outcome of causes preceding them.
The opposite is indeterminism.
Dialectic i) Skill in questioning or
argument. ii) The idea that any
assertion, whether in word or deed,
evokes opposition, the two of which
are reconciled in a synthesis that
includes elements of both.
Dualism A view of something as
made up of two irreducible parts,
such as the idea of human beings
as consisting of bodies and minds,
the two being radically unlike.
Emotive Expressing emotion. In
philosophy the term is often used
in a derogatory way for utterances
that pretend to be objective or
impartial while in fact expressing
emotional attitudes, as for example
in “emotive deﬁnition.”
Empirical knowledge Knowledge
of the empirical world.
Empirical statement A statement
about the empirical world; what is
or could be experienced.
Empirical world The world as
revealed to us by our actual or
possible experience.
Empiricism The view that all
knowledge of anything that
actually exists must be derived
from experience.

GLOSSARY 341
Epistemology The branch of
philosophy concerned with what
sort of thing, if anything, we can
know; how we know it; and what
knowledge is. In practice it is the
dominant branch of philosophy.

Hypothesis A theory whose truth
is assumed for the time being
because it forms a useful starting
point for further investigation,
despite limited evidence to prove
its validity.

Essence The essence of a thing is
that which is distinctive about it
and makes it what it is. For instance,
the essence of a unicorn is that it is
a horse with a single horn on its
head. Unicorns do not exist of
course—so essence does not imply
existence. This distinction is
important in philosophy.

Idealism The view that reality
consists ultimately of something
nonmaterial, whether it be mind,
the contents of mind, spirits, or
one spirit. The opposite point of
view is materialism.

Ethics A branch of philosophy
that is concerned with questions
about how we should live, and
therefore about the nature of right
and wrong, good and bad, ought
and ought not, duty, and other
such concepts.
Existentialism A philosophy
that begins with the contingent
existence of the individual human
being and regards that as the
primary enigma. It is from this
starting point that philosophical
understanding is pursued.
Fallacy A seriously wrong
argument, or a false conclusion
based on such an argument.
Falsiﬁability A statement, or set
of statements, is falsiﬁable if it
can be proved wrong by empirical
testing. According to Karl Popper,
falsiﬁability is what distinguishes
science from nonscience.
Humanism A philosophical
approach based on the assumption
that mankind is the most important
thing that exists, and that there can
be no knowledge of a supernatural
world, if any such world exists.

Indeterminism The view that not
all events are necessary outcomes
of events that may have preceeded
them. The opposite is point of view
is determinism.
Induction Reasoning from the
particular to the general. An
example would be “Socrates died,
Plato died, Aristotle died, and each
other individual man who was born
more than 130 years ago has died.
Therefore all men are mortal.”
Induction does not necessarily yield
results that are true, so whether it
is genuinely a logical process is
disputed. The opposite process is
called deduction.
Intuition Direct knowing, whether
by sensory perception or by insight;
a form of knowledge that makes no
use of reasoning.
Irreducible An irreducible thing
is one that cannot be brought to a
simpler or reduced form.
Linguistic philosophy Also
known as linguistic analysis. The
view that philosophical problems
arise from a muddled use of
language, and are to be solved, or
dissolved, by a careful analysis
of the language in which they
have been expressed.

Logic The branch of philosophy
that makes a study of rational
argument itself—its terms,
concepts, rules, and methods.
Logical positivism The view that
the only empirical statements
that are meaningful are those that
are veriﬁable.
Materialism The doctrine that
all real existence is ultimately of
something material. The opposite
point of view is idealism.
Metaphilosophy The branch of
philosophy that looks at the nature
and methods of philosophy itself.
Metaphysics The branch of
philosophy concerned with the
ultimate nature of what exists. It
questions the natural world “from
outside”, and its questions cannot
be answered by science.
Methodology The study of methods
of enquiry and argument.
Monism A view of something as
formed by a single element; for
example, the view that human
beings do not consist of elements
that are ultimately separable, like
a body and a soul, but are of one
single substance.
Mysticism Intuitive knowledge
that transcends the natural world.
Naturalism The view that reality
is explicable without reference to
anything outside the natural world.
Necessary Must be the case. The
opposite is contingent. Hume
believed that necessary connections
existed only in logic, not in the real
world, a view that has been upheld
by many philosophers since.

342 GLOSSARY
Necessary and sufﬁcient
conditions For X to be a husband
it is a necessary condition for X to
be married. However, this is not a
sufﬁcient condition—for what if X
is female? A sufﬁcient condition for
X to be a husband is that X is both
a man and married. One of the
commonest forms of error in
thinking is to mistake necessary
conditions for sufﬁcient conditions.

Phenomenon An experience that
is immediately present. If I look at
an object, the object as experienced
by me is a phenomenon. Immanuel
Kant distinguished this from the
object as it is in itself, independently
of being experienced: this he called
the noumenon.

Noumenon The unknowable
reality behind what presents itself
to human consciousness, the latter
being known as phenomenon. A
thing as it is in itself, independently
of being experienced, is said to be
the noumenon. “The noumenal” has
therefore become a term for the
ultimate nature of reality.

Philosophy Literally, “the love of
wisdom.” The word is widely used
for any sustained rational reﬂection
about general principles that has
the aim of achieving a deeper
understanding. Philosophy provides
training in the disciplined analysis
and clariﬁcation of arguments,
theories, methods, and utterances
of all kinds, and the concepts of
which they make use. Traditionally,
its ultimate aim has been to attain
a better understanding of the world,
though in the 20th century a good
deal of philosophy became devoted
to attaining a better understanding
of its own procedures.

Numinous Anything regarded as
mysterious and awesome, bearing
intimations from outside the natural
realm. Not to be confused with the
noumenal; see noumenon above.

Philosophy of religion The
branch of philosophy that looks at
human belief systems and the real
or imaginary objects, such as gods,
that form the basis for these beliefs.

Ontology A branch of philosophy
that asks what actually exists, as
distinct from the nature of our
knowledge of it, which is covered
by the branch of epistemology.
Ontology and epistemology taken
together constitute the central
tradition of philosophy.

Philosophy of science A branch
of philosophy concerned with the
nature of scientiﬁc knowledge and
the practice of scientiﬁc endeavor.

Noncontradictory Statements are
considered noncontradictory if their
truth-values are independent of
one another.

Phenomenology An approach
to philosophy which investigates
objects of experience (known as
phenomena) only to the extent
that they manifest themselves in
our consciousness, without making
any assumptions about their
nature as independent things.

Political philosophy The branch
of philosophy that questions the
nature and methods of the state
and deals with such subjects as
justice, law, social hierarchies,
political power, and constitutions.
Postmodernism A viewpoint that
holds a general distrust of theories,
narratives, and ideologies that
attempt to put all knowledge into
a single framework.

Pragmatism A theory of truth.
It holds that a statement is true if
it does all the jobs required of it:
accurately describes a situation;
prompts us to anticipate experience
correctly; ﬁts in with already wellattested statements; and so on.
Premise The starting point of an
argument. Any argument has to
start from at least one premise, and
therefore does not prove its own
premises. A valid argument proves
that its conclusions follow from its
premises—but this is not the same
as proving that its conclusions are
true, which is something no
argument can do.
Presupposition Something taken
for granted but not expressed. All
utterances have presuppositions,
and these may be conscious or
unconscious. If a presupposition is
mistaken, an utterance based on it
may also be mistaken, though the
mistake may not evident in the
utterance itself. The study of
philosophy teaches us to become
more aware of presuppositions.
Primary and secondary qualities
John Locke divided the properties
of a physical object into those
that are possessed by the object
independently of being experienced,
such as its location, dimensions,
velocity, mass, and so on (which he
called primary qualities), and those
that involve the interaction of an
experiencing observer, such as the
object’s color and taste (which he
called secondary qualities).
Property In philosophy this
word is commonly used to mean a
characteristic; for example “fur or
hair is a deﬁning property of a
mammal.” See also primary and
secondary qualities.

GLOSSARY 343
Rational Based on, or according
to, the principles of reason or logic.
Proposition The content of a
statement that conﬁrms or denies
whether something is the case, and
is capable of being true or false.
Rationalism The view that we
can gain knowledge of the world
through the use of reason, without
relying on sense-perception, which
is regarded by rationalists as
unreliable. The opposite view
is known as empiricism.
Scepticism The view that it is
impossible for us to know anything
for certain.
Semantics The study of meanings
in linguistic expressions.
Semiotics The study of signs
and symbols, in particular their
relationships with the things they
are meant to signify.
Social contract An implicit
agreement among members of a
society to cooperate in order to
achieve goals that beneﬁt the whole
group, sometimes at the expense
of individuals within it.
Solipsism The view that only the
existence of the self can be known.
Sophist Someone whose aim in
argument is not to seek the truth
but to win the argument. In ancient
Greece, young men aspiring to
public life were taught by sophists
to learn the various methods of
winning arguments.
Synthesis Seeking a deeper
understanding of something by
putting the pieces together. The
opposite is analysis.

Synthetic statement A statement
that has to be set against facts
outside itself for its truth to be
determined. The opposite is an
analytic statement.

Universalism The belief that
we should apply to ourselves the
same standards and values that we
apply to others. Not to be confused
with universal, above.

Teleology A study of ends or
goals. A teleological explanation
is one that explains something in
terms of the ends that it serves.

Utilitarianism A theory of politics
and ethics that judges the morality
of actions by their consequences,
that regards the most desirable
consequence of any action as the
greatest good of the greatest
number, and that deﬁnes “good”
in terms of pleasure and the
absence of pain.

Theology Enquiry into scholarly
and intellectual questions
concerning the nature of God.
Philosophy, by contrast, does not
assume the existence of God,
though some philosophers have
attempted to prove his existence.
Thing-in-itself Another term for
a noumenon, from the German
Ding-an-sich.
Transcendental Outside the
world of sense experience.
Someone who believes that ethics
are transcendental believes that
ethics have their source outside the
empirical world. Thoroughgoing
empiricists do not believe that
anything transcendental exists,
and nor did Friedrich Nietzsche
or humanist existentialists.
Truth-value Either of two values,
namely true or false, that can be
applied to a statement.
Universal A concept of general
application, like “red” or “woman.”
It has been disputed whether
universals have an existence of
their own. Does “redness” exist, or
are there only individual red objects?
In the Middle Ages, philosophers
who believed that “redness” had a
real existence were called “realists”,
while philosophers who maintained
that it was no more than a word
were called “nominalists.”

Validity An argument is valid
if its conclusion follows from its
premises. This does not necessarily
mean that the conclusion is true: it
may be false if one of the premises
is false, though the argument itself
is still valid.
Veriﬁability A statement or set
of statements can be veriﬁed if it
can be proved to be true by looking
at empirical evidence. Logical
positivists believed that the only
empirical statements that were
meaningful were those that were
veriﬁable. David Hume and Karl
Popper pointed out that scientiﬁc
laws were unveriﬁable.
World In philosophy the word
“world” has been given a special
sense, meaning “the whole of
empirical reality”, and may
therefore also be equated with
the totality of actual and possible
experience. True empiricists
believe that the world is all there is,
but philosophers with different
views believe that the world does
not account for total reality. Such
philosophers believe that there is a
transcendental realm as well as
an empirical realm, and they may
believe that both are equally real.
